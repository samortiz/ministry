Paul realized that, because he had disciplined the Corinthians in the first Epistle, he needed to bind up their wounds in this Epistle
What Paul was doing here is similar to the comfort a parent may give to a child after the child has been disciplined
In the first chapter and a half of 2 Corinthians, Paul pours oil into the wounds of the Corinthians, wounds caused by his discipline
When Paul was pouring oil into the wounds and binding them up, he exercised his emotion and released it in a very positive way
Verse 3 reveals Pauls emotion Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement
Paul's reference to affliction, suffering, and encouragement in verses 4 and 5 also indicates that he was emotional
He used this long introduction to resolve their complications and calm them down so that they could receive his word
In verse 4 Paul says that we encourage those in affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God
You will be like someone writing a check for a large amount of money without having the funds in the bank to back up such a check
Now the second Epistle brings them back into the experience of Christ, who was the subject of his argument in the first Epistle
In the second, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are further developed, but the gifts are not even mentioned
The ministry is to minister Christ whom we have experienced; the gifts are just to teach the doctrines concerning Christ
In verse 5 Paul says, 'Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our encouragement also abounds'
The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received encouragement
Resurrection should be our daily life; it should be for us the power to overcome sin and death and live in the first day of the week
The words 'will deliver' refer to the immediate future, whereas 'will also yet deliver' refers to the future in a more general way
There was no way for a human being to escape out of such a situation of death or to have the power to overcome it
In these verses Paul tells the Corinthians how the apostles were encouraged and thus were qualified to encourage others
Because Paul and his co-workers experienced such a grace, they had the spiritual capacity necessary to encourage others
If we have not had the experience described here, we shall not be able to understand what Paul is talking about in these verses
Apparently Paul's word here is simple and easy to understand; actually Paul is referring to something deep and profound
Paul says that their boasting was the testimony of their conscience regarding the way they lived and behaved themselves
The deep thought and rich experience found in verse 12 are mainly related to the Greek word that means singleness, sincerity
The situation in which Paul found himself in Asia forced him to be single or simple in the way he dealt with it
No matter how knowledgeable, capable, or wealthy we may be, there is nothing we can do about a death situation
When Paul and his co-workers were suffering affliction in Asia, they were pressed to such an extent that they regarded themselves as dead
The source of confusion and division among Christians today is the complications that are within the believers
If there is a problem in your locality, that problem comes from someone who is not simple, but who is complicated
From experience we have learned that a person who is simple and single is also generous and full of liberality
Of being willing to give freely, they may consider the matter in a complicated way and then give an amount that falls short of the need
Paul's conscience testified that toward the Corinthians he and his co-workers conducted themselves in the singleness of God
If a married brother is simple, he will be very generous toward his wife, no matter what she does or how she treats him
The grace in verse 12 is the gift in verse 11, which the apostles received for the experience of resurrection in their sufferings
Only by living a life in the singleness and sincerity of God can we be constituted ministers of Christ and of grace
We have pointed out that Paul wrote such a long introduction in order to calm down the Corinthian believers and to soothe them
Because this was the situation with at least some of the Corinthians, Paul included 1:15-22 in his word of introduction
Verse 16 says And through you to pass through into Macedonia and again from Macedonia to come to you and by you to be sent forward to Judea
Macedonia was a province of the Roman Empire, north of Achaia, in which were the cities of Philippi and Thessalonica
The word of the apostles' preaching in verse 18, their word toward the Corinthians, was their message concerning Christ
From the first time he came to the Corinthians until the writing of this Epistle, his preaching sounded the same note
When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes the fulfillment of all the promises of God this is a glory to God through us
Even in the insignificant matter of resolving to go to a certain place, Paul resolved not in himself, but in Christ and with Christ
His intention to come to the Corinthians was resolved in oneness with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God
In verse 21 Paul goes on to say, 'But He Who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God'
Paul uses 'but' to indicate that even his being one with God and living Christ were not of himself or by himself
God attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, connecting the apostles and the believers with Christ, the anointed One
Since we have been attached by God unto Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God
Although the Greek word rendered attaches in verse 21 is establishes, the true meaning of the word here is not establish; it is attach
The preposition 'unto' used here is stronger than the preposition 'to,' for 'unto' implies a result, a particular end that is in view
Paul realized that he could be one with the faithful God and live Christ because he had been attached to Christ and anointed by God
Because God anointed him by attaching him to Christ, he could be one with Christ and one with the faithful God
Now because we have been attached to the anointed One, we can be one with the God of resurrection and live a life of resurrection
God attaches us in this present age, but He anointed us long before we were born, when Christ Himself was anointed
If we understand this, we shall understand why the verbs 'attaches' and 'has anointed' are in different tenses
The anointing brings the divine essence into us, just as the rubber stamp applies the element of the ink to the paper
Through these experiences of the anointing Spirit, with the experience of the cross, the ministry of Christ is produced
Because we have been anointed and sealed and have received the pledge, we can be one with the faithful God and live Christ
The Spirit as the earnest of God being our portion is a foretaste to us; so here it says that He is in our hearts
The apostle called on God to be a witness against his soul, that is, against himself, if he was speaking falsely
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality'
Since to pray is to worship, and since the Lord Jesus says that our worship of God must be in spirit, then our prayer must be in spirit also
Paul did not want to come to Corinth with a rod to discipline them; rather, he wanted to spare them and come to them in love
In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, 'Not that we lord it over your faith, but are fellow-workers of your joy; for in faith you stand'
On the one hand, Paul called on God as a witness against his soul; on the other hand, he tells us that he determined something in himself
In 2:1 Paul's self is a spiritual self, a spiritual soul, a soul under the control and direction of the spirit
We need to remember, however, that this was determined by one who was under the control and direction of the spirit
The Lord Jesus, as a man, performed miracles, but it was God who did these miracles and not the Lord Jesus Himself
In this introductory section he not only speaks about himself-he also argues on his behalf and vindicates himself
He wrote to the Corinthians in this way, not that they should be made sorrowful, but that they should know the love which he had toward them
Of rebuking, there is now the need for encouragement and forgiveness, also for soothing and the binding up of the wounds
Those who hold this view may refer to the Lord's word in John 20:23 about the disciples having authority to forgive sins
According to this interpretation, to forgive a sinful brother means to forgive him on behalf of the Lord and as the Lord's representative
If the index of the Lord's eyes indicated that He was not pleased with Paul's forgiving that brother, Paul would not have forgiven him
As Paul was forgiving the brother, he was looking at the Lord Jesus and realized that the Lord was encouraging him
In 1940 Brother Nee pointed out that Deuteronomy may be considered the autobiography of Moses and 2 Corinthians, the autobiography of Paul
In verse 11 Paul says, 'That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts'
The Greek word translated thoughts here means plans, plots, devices, schemes, designs, wiles, intentions, purposes
Do not think that the matter of forgiving a brother involves only the church and does not involve the devices of Satan
Even behind such a matter as this, Satan may be crouching, looking for a way to execute his evil plans and devour the weak ones
We all should learn of Paul to care for the saints, to live Christ, and to be aware of the subtlety of the enemy
In 1940, while giving messages on 2 Corinthians, Brother Nee strongly emphasized the difference between 1 and 2 Corinthians
Brother Nee used the illustration of Balaam's donkey speaking a human language, pointing out that that was a genuine miraculous gift
We need to be constituted with what Christ is, with what He has done, with what He has attained, and with what He has obtained
Today what Christ is, what He has done, what He has obtained, and what He has attained are all in the life-giving Spirit
When the young people hear this word about how long it takes to be constituted into a minister of the new covenant, they may be disappointed
Now we are ready to consider 2:12-17, some verses which are the introduction to the section on the ministry of the new covenant
In addition to what he has mentioned in verses 10 and 11, the apostle furthermore tells the Corinthian believers of his concern for them
He left Troas and went forth to Macedonia , being anxious to meet Titus for the information because of his great affection for them
Paul deliberately inserted the phrase in the Lord to indicate that he did not open the door through any kind of natural skill or maneuvering
How can we reconcile the fact that the door was open by the Lord and yet Paul did not have the relief in his spirit to remain there?
His concern was not mainly for the preaching of the gospel; it was to find Titus in order to know the situation among the Corinthians
Paul was waiting for Titus to give him a report concerning how the believers at Corinth had responded to his first Epistle
It seems that he did not go along with the Lord's opening of the door, but only went along with what gave relief to his spirit
Sometimes the Lord will do two things at once: He will open up something outwardly, but inwardly He will not give you a feeling of relief
If you obey the inner feeling and do not go along with the outward open situation, you are a truly spiritual person
The word 'us' here refers to the conquered captives in the train of Christ's triumph, celebrating and participating in Christ's triumph
In the second section of this Epistle, from 2:12 through 7:16, the apostle speaks about his ministry and that of his co-workers
Their move in their ministry for Christ is like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God's leading
Paul and his co-workers were Christ's captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ for His triumphant glory
He fought against Christ the heavenly General but eventually he was defeated subdued and captured and thereby became a captive of Christ
Paul uses the metaphor of a procession held in honor of the victory of a Roman general to illustrate what he was in the ministry
The apostles' move in the ministry was like a triumphal celebration from one place to another under God's leading
Wherever that procession moved, they celebrated the victory of Christ and witnessed of Christ's triumph over them
The apostles are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph
In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, 'For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing'
Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this
The word peddling also means retailing, hawking, the selling of inferior things at high prices by low class peddlers in a tricky way
The triumph of the ministry is the celebration of Christ's victory by the conquered captives in the train of this procession
Since we are in the procession, we have been captured and subdued, whether or not we feel this is our situation
After giving us a picture of the ministry's triumph and effect, Paul shows the function of this ministry and also its competency
Because the ministry results either in life unto life or death unto death, Paul exclaimed in 2:16, 'Who is sufficient for these things'?
These questions are raised because of the apostle's frank and faithful word in the preceding verse concerning himself and his co-workers
The Corinthian believers, as the apostles' living letter of commendation were inscribed in the apostles' hearts
All believers in Christ should be such a living letter of Christ that others may read and know Christ in their being
It seems that here there are two kinds of letterthe letter inscribed in the hearts of the apostles and the believers as the letter of Christ
Grammatically speaking, in these verses Paul is saying, 'You are our letter because you are a letter of Christ'
It is because the believers are a letter of Christ that they are also the letter inscribed in the heart of the apostles
In verse 3 Paul says that the letter of Christ is inscribed 'not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart'
When the apostles preach Christ or minister Christ, they minister Him into the heart and spirit of the believers
The writing that takes place in our hearts by the ministers of the new covenant has the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the element
Today while we are ministering Christ to others, Christ is simultaneously written in the one to whom we are ministering and also in us
In this way they became a letter of Christ, and this letter was also within the heart of the writer, the apostle
On the one hand, they were the letter of Christ; on the other hand, they were the letter of the apostles inscribed in their hearts
The one writing brought forth a twofold result, in the hearts of the apostles and in the hearts of the believers
If you meditate on this metaphor, pray about it, and have fellowship concerning it, you will see more and realize more
They may think that in just a short period of time those in their country in the Lord's recovery will number in the millions
When Paul came forth to minister, we are not told that thousands were gained for the Lord through his ministry
When we read of such a door being opened to Paul, we may think that thousands were being added to the church through his ministry
Only the Triune God constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the work of writing living letters of Christ
The Spirit is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostles minister Christ into the believers to make them His living letters
The letter which kills is the letter of the law, which only requires of man but is unable to supply man with life
The writer of these living letters is actually not Paul; the writer is the very God who has been constituted into Paul's being
It is not the pen that actually does the writing; it is the ink, the substance which fills the pen, that does this
In the same principle, the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is both the writer and the writing substance
How rebellious he was against the Lord Jesus, against the churches, against God's administration, and against God's New Testament economy!
As the apostles were marching in this procession, they could say, 'Jews and Gentiles, look at us and realize how triumphant Christ is'
As we have emphasized, the function of the ministry of the new covenant is to write, even to inscribe, living letters of Christ
The ministry of the new covenant has glory, and this glory is much better than that of the old covenant ministry
In verses 7 and 8 Paul gives us a strong comparison between the ministry of death and the ministry of the Spirit
In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, 'For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
The ministry of the old covenant became one of death because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death and death unto condemnation
In verse 10 Paul continues For that which has also been glorified has not been glorified in this respect on account of the surpassing glory
Because of the glory of the new covenant ministry , the temporary glory of the ministry of law disappears and no longer exists
If it were possible for the room to be filled with sunlight, the artificial light would seem to be no light at all
When Moses came down from the mountain, his face shone, and the children of Israel could gaze upon that shining
The old covenant ministry was glorified temporarily, but it never had any glory, on account of the surpassing glory
Verse 11 says, 'For if that which was being done away was through glory, much rather that which remains is in glory'
The old glory shone on Moses' face individually, but the New Testament glory shines from many different believers
According to 3:12-18, these ministers are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit
In verse 12 Paul says that the ministers of the new covenant have hope, for the shining glory of the new covenant ministry remains forever
We have the confidence that we are ministering the truth that carries the glory and that the glory in this truth will remain
Since this fact was not revealed to the sons of Israel, their thoughts were hardened, and their minds were blinded
The veil is being done away in Christ through the new covenant economy, yet it still remains in their minds when they read the old covenant
Immediately and unconsciously Saul's heart was turned to the Lord, and he called, saying, 'Who art thou, Lord'?
The reason Paul received so much light was due to one factor: the turning of his heart to the Lord and the taking away of the veil
16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers , and the ministration of which is with glory
Which giveth life, verse 6, meaning, 'the Lord', as here spoken of, 'Christ', 'is the Spirit', is identical with the Holy Spirit:
Throughout the centuries there have been a number of teachers who believed that, according to verse 17, Christ the Lord is the Spirit
We cannot deny what the book of Revelation says concerning the seven Spirits, that the third of the Trinity is the eyes of the second
In verse 18 'we' denotes the apostles, who, as examples and representatives of all believers, are the ministers of Christ
As vessels we need to have an unveiled face; that is, we need to be open to the divine life with its power, essence, and shape
The 'same image' means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God's new covenant economy
After speaking about the ministry of the new covenant, the apostle continues to speak about the ministers of the new covenant
The ministers of the new covenant are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit
The second aspect concerning the ministers of the new covenant is how they conduct themselves, the way they behave
They conduct themselves in such a way that the gospel of Christ may shine through them and out from within them
The gospel can be compared to Christ shining forth as the sun, the God of glory embodied in His redemptive work
He and his co-workers, ministers of the new covenant, conducted themselves for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ
All the apostles' works are to carry out this unique ministry of ministering Christ to others for the building up of His Body
There was the need for someone to fill the gap among the Apostles, for someone to join the eleven in bearing the ministry
The Greek word rendered adulterate primarily means to ensnare; then to corrupt, as in the case of gold or wine that is not pure
The meaning is narrower than that of the word for peddling in 2:17, which adds the sense of being for the sake of gain
To adulterate gold is to mix it with some inferior metal for the purpose of selling it at a price higher than its actual value
To adulterate wine is to mix it with another kind of liquid for the purpose of presenting it as if it were wine of good quality
Only a small percentage may be the Word, with the remainder being the adulterating elements that have been added to the Word
He certainly did not adulterate the word of God, but presented the pure gold, even the refined gold, of the Word
By the manifestation of the truth, Paul and his workers commended themselves to every man's conscience before God
It means reality and denotes all the real things revealed in God's Word, which mainly are Christ as the reality of all the things of God
In principle, anything like philosophy or cultural traditions that hinders others from apprehending the gospel of Christ is a veil
The preaching of Christ must unveil them, just as in photography we remove the cover from the lens of a camera in order to take a picture
When the shining comes into us through our open mind, it reaches our spirit and brings the figure of Christ, the image of God, into us
Literally, the Greek word translated shine in verse 4 first means to see distinctly, to discern; second, it means to shine
Verse 5 says, 'For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
If man's heart is not veiled with anything, not blinded by Satan, the god of this age, man can see its illumination
They are able to exalt Christ as the Lord in their preaching and conduct themselves as slaves to the believers in their service
In the heart is related to the inner life, whereas on the skin of the face has nothing to do with the inner life
The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ's gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our hearts
The glory of the gospel shines in the face of the One through whom grace and reality came, issuing in righteousness and life
The glory of the law shone on the face of one through whom the law was given , resulting in condemnation and death
It is to enlighten us so that we may know not the law of Moses of the old covenant, but the gospel of Christ of the new covenant
Whenever we call on the Lord in a dear, intimate way, we are before His face, and the shining of God is in our heart
In verse 7 Paul says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
These vessels are like today's camera, into which the image of Christ enters through the flashing of God's shining light
No other chapters in these Epistles are so related to the constitution of Christ for the deeper experience of life
How could such a rebel against God become a minister of the new covenant, a minister of Christ for the carrying out of God's economy?
Without the element as the essence of the constitution, it is not possible for us to be constituted of anything
These four major steps of God's process are also the ingredients of the processed God as the element with which we are constituted
The Lord Jesus, a wonderful Person with two natures, divinity and humanity, lived in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth for thirty years
Satan and the old creation have been terminated, and we also were terminated by the death of Christ on the cross
God has been brought into us through incarnation, and we have been brought into God through Christ's resurrection
A believer is one who does not trust in things that can be seen but he takes certain unseen things confesses them and realizes them by faith
The Bible reveals that God has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous
All of verse 7 reads like this: 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
The members of our family and the saints in the church cooperate with the persecutors and opposers to put us under the grinding
If you read the four Gospels again, you will see that it was those close to the Lord Jesus who caused Him to experience the grinding
He said, 'For whoever does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother'
The word translated despairing literally means utterly unable to find a way out; that is, the way is entirely shut up
The apostle is saying they were perplexed, unable to find a way out, yet not despairing, not utterly unable to find a way out
The life in verse 10 is the resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross
The continual daily grinding works for a specific purpose: that the life of Jesus might be manifested in our body
The interchangeable use of 'flesh' and 'body' in these verses indicates that the mortal flesh is in our fallen body
Vincent says, 'Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both'
Verse 14 says, 'Knowing that He Who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you'
As the apostles were under the killing, life was being imparted to others, and grace was abounding through the many
Paul did not care for the sufferings, because he realized that his being killed imparted life to many and this life became grace to them
If you move to escape the grinding, you will find that in the place to which you move you will be ground even more
Without this kind of ministry, there is no way to have the church adequately built up or to have the bride properly adorned
We need to have a heart not only to love the Lord in a general way, but also to become ministers of the New Testament
In 416 Paul says Wherefore we do not lose heart but if indeed our outward man is decaying yet our inward man is being renewed day by day
Since the initiative was taken by the persecutors and by the circumstances and environment it is better to say that they were being consumed
According to some inner life teachers we may either be soulish ones who live in the outward man or spiritual ones who live in the inward man
According to the context of 2 Corinthians 4, the outward man refers mainly to the body in verse 10 and to the mortal flesh in verse 11
In 1 Corinthians 15:44 Paul speaks of a soulish body, a natural body animated by the soul, a body in which the soul predominates
In verse 17 Paul says, 'For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory'
Paul did not care for the affliction, the environment, the poverty, the opposition, the persecution, or the grinding
He knew that while he was in the condition of being ground, the affliction was working out something weighty, beautiful, and eternal
In chapter four we see the way these ministers conduct themselves , and we have a record regarding their living
Transfiguration changes our mortal body into a body of glory, just like the resurrected body of the Lord Jesus
The word 'tabernacle' indicates that our physical body, in which our person dwells, is not only for living, but also for worshipping God
The word house indicates that the body is our dwelling place and the word tabernacle indicates that this house is a temporary dwelling place
In verse 2 Paul says, 'For indeed in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven'
If this is true, then there are a great many naked persons in heaven, for those who have died are now disembodied
The apostles groaned in the desire not to be unclothed disembodied that is not to die but to be clothed upon to put on the spiritual body
To have our mortal body 'swallowed up by life' is to have it transfigured by resurrection life swallowing the death in our mortal body
Verse 5 says, 'Now He Who has wrought us for this very thing is God, Who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit'
On the other hand, transfiguration means that the indwelling Christ is saturating our body and swallowing up the element of death in it
When our body has been saturated in full, it will become a new body, a new building, with which we shall be clothed
According to verse 5, as the One who has wrought us for this very thing, God has given to us the pledge of the Spirit
The apostles regulate their life and conduct themselves by faith, as testified in Hebrews 11, not by that which is seen
To be away from home out of the body is to die, to be out of the material realm and to be with the Lord in the spiritual realm
For this reason, in their daily living there is nothing of the old creation: no self, no flesh, no natural life
The processed God as the life-giving Spirit includes divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
We have pointed out that the basic qualification of a new covenant minister is to be constituted of the processed Triune God
The second qualification of the ministers of the new covenant is to conduct themselves for the shining out of the gospel
Because they had been constituted in a certain way, they could live a life that manifests the truth and shines forth the glory of the gospel
Apart from their consciousness and intention, simply by the way they lived, there was a shining forth from their being
Because this shining came out of their being, their constitution, their behavior was not a performance of any kind
Panton once pointed out that today's preachers often give people 'admission tickets' that will not be accepted by those guarding the 'gate'
As they grow older and mature, they desire to graduate from school, have a good job, and get married and raise a family
If you claim that you have the desire to be raptured to be clothed upon with a heavenly building then you must pass through 2 Corinthians 4
When you have such a longing, such an aspiration, you are a mature believer, one who is ready to be reaped, ready for the harvest
Paul speaks of this in verse 9: 'Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to Him'
In verse 9 ambitious means to be zealous with a strong aim, striving earnestly to be well-pleasing to the Lord
To live to the law means that we are under the law, directed by the law, governed by the law, and have the responsibility to fulfill the law
To live to ourselves means that we are under our own control, direction, and governing and that we care for our own aims and goals
The apostles, who were ripe and ready for rapture, had the single ambition of pleasing the Lord by living to Him
He realizes that if he does not live in every respect to those in that church, he may be dismissed from the position of pastor
As one who was mature, ripe, and ready for the rapture, Paul's only aim was to please his Master, the very One whose coming he was awaiting
They are different from Paul whose ambition was to please his Master not by doing things for Him, but by living to Him
The fear of the Lord as mentioned here does not refer to the Lord's being fearsome; it refers to our fearing the Lord
Verse 13 says, 'For whether we were beside ourselves, it was for God; whether we are sober-minded, it is for you'
In verse 14 Paul explains, 'For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died'
Christ's loving death was the motivating factor of the apostles' being constrained to live a loving life for Him
Since Christ died as our substitute, suffering the sentence of death on behalf of us all, in the eyes of God we all died
In 5:16-21 we see that the apostles have been commissioned with the ministry of reconciliation for the Lord's new creation
As those who were mature and ready to be raptured, the apostles were commissioned by the Lord to bring others back to God in full
As Paul speaks of his ministry of bringing others back to God, he spontaneously presents a clear view of the two steps of reconciliation
In the typology of the Old Testament there was atonement, but in the fulfillment in the New Testament there is redemption
Passing through the first veil signifies the first step of a sinner and a rebel being brought back to God and being reconciled to Him
As the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, so these believers were wandering in the soul, in particular in the mind
The believers at Corinth had experienced the first step of reconciliation, but they had not experienced the second
As there was a veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, so a veil still remained between the Corinthians and God
The flesh was the veil that kept the Corinthian believers away from the direct presence of God in the Holy of Holies
These ministers of the new covenant were qualified to bring back to God anyone who had not been fully reconciled to Him
As long as we have not been brought back to God fully, we need someone like the apostles to bring us back to Him
Verse 17 says, 'So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection
The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does
They are a new creation , not according to the old nature of flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life
Paul, on the one hand, regarded the Corinthians as the old creation, because they were still living in their flesh
The 'all things' here refer to all the positive things mentioned in verses 14 through 21, of which God is the Originator and Initiator
We have indicated that these two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle
A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen
The Corinthian believers had been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place
They needed to pass the second veil, which has been rent already to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit
Because the veil of the flesh, the veil of the natural life, remains with you, you are not yet in the Holy of Holies
Corinthians, my burden is to help you realize that this second veil has already been riven and that you must deny your flesh and crucify it
Verse 21 says, 'Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him'
Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God , entered into man , and made man not only a sinner, but sin itself under God's judgment
When Christ became a man in flesh , He was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God that we might become God's righteousness in Him
In order to understand what it means to say that God made Christ sin on our behalf, we need to read John 1:14 and Romans 8:3
Romans 8:3 says, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
In order for us to be reconciled further, even fully, to God, it was necessary for Christ to die also for us, not only for our sins
Christ's dying for our sins accomplishes the first step of reconciliation, and His dying for us accomplishes the second step
The veil, the natural man, the natural life, the flesh, was cleft through the subjective aspect of Christ's death
The genuine Christians who are in the Holy Place have been brought there by some who were already in the Holy Place
Because we have been reconciled to Him to this extent, we can help others to be reconciled to the same extent'
God condemned Him in flesh as sin for us, through His death, that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God's righteousness
In the organic union with Christ, those who have been brought thoroughly back to God are made the righteousness of God
Now in Christ, having been brought thoroughly back to God, we may enjoy Christ to such an extent that in Him we become God's righteousness
We are concerned not simply with living Christ for the church, but with seeing a pattern of living Christ for the church
These problems are of two categories: the problems in the realm of human life and the problems in the realm of the divine administration
By what kind of life can we have a proper human life, and by what means, by what instrument, can we carry out the divine administration?
Verse 9 says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
The Son of God, who is both the wisdom of God and the power of God, is becoming my daily holiness and sanctification'
If the sister calls on the name of the Lord Jesus, she will gain Him as righteousness and also as sanctification
Now, daily and hourly, we need to enjoy Him, first as righteousness, then as sanctification, and then as redemption
In order to discern Him and realize Him, we must be a spiritual person, a person who exercises the spirit and lives in the spirit
As the foundation grows in us this growth produces gold silver and precious stones the materials needed for the building up of the church
According to Christs full salvation which includes metabolic transformation our body is grafted into Christ and becomes a member of Christ
The more you believe it, the more the indwelling Spirit will saturate your body and cause it to be organically united with Christ
When we experience the Triune God becoming involved with the three parts of our being, we become genuine saints
Paul was burdened that the entire being of the Corinthians would be taken over and possessed by the Triune God
Now the first day is a sign that the Triune God has been processed in resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
God in creation is for our worship, but God in resurrection is not only for worship, but also for our enjoyment
Corinthians is a book that speaks of living Christ for the church, a book that tells us how to live Christ for the church
Throughout the centuries, the Lord's people have not realized that 1 Corinthians tells us to live Christ for the church
If we read this Epistle in a thoughtful way, we may wonder if there is a pattern of living Christ for the church
We were pressed beyond our power, beyond our ability to withstand pressure, so that we despaired even of living
Christ passed through incarnation, through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and through crucifixion, which lasted six hours
He was not the kind of person who would say yes at one time and then shortly afterward change his answer and say no
Paul tells the Corinthians that he did not want them to be ignorant of the afflictions they experienced in Asia
It is easy to say in a doctrinal way that we have been crucified with Christ, that we no longer live, and that Christ lives in us
It is possible to go on speaking like this for years, quoting Galatians 2:20 again and again, but still not live Christ for the church
Thank the Lord that in all these verses in 2 Corinthians 1 we see that Paul was a pattern of living Christ for the church
The Bible shows us not only things that can be compared to 'feathers' and 'skin'; it also reveals things that can be compared to 'meat'
In the Reformation the Bible was opened to a certain extent, and the revelation of the divine Word was somewhat recovered
During the Reformation the skins and the feathers were recovered; however, the depths of the Word were not opened very much
Let us take some examples from 1 Corinthians to illustrate what we mean by the feathers, skin, and meat in the Word
If we remain in verse 12, concentrating on the matter of division, we shall have only the feathers and the skins
Christmas and the system of Christianity include many things that are not even the genuine feathers and skins in the Bible
These definitely are truths in the Bible; however they are 'feather-truths' or 'skin-truths,' not 'meat-truths'
These verses declare that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality
John 14:23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
The tragedy among Christians today is that they care for the feathers and the skin, but they do not care much for the meat
Most readers of 1 Corinthians 5 pay attention to an uncomely feather, the case of the sinful brother who committed incest
As we read the Bible, we need to pay attention not only to the feathers and the skin, but much more to the meat
The answer to this question is that Paul was an attached person, a person attached to Christ, the anointed One
In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, 'But He Who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God'
If we would live Christ for the church, we must learn of Paul as our pattern to be a person attached to Christ
As we have pointed out, the verb 'leads us in triumph' means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession
Rather, her attitude may be that even though she married her husband, she has no intention of being subdued by him
Concerning living Christ for the church, we have listed six matters: attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led
As incense-bearers, the apostles scatter the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphal ministry as in a triumphal procession
The apostles are such incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ and captives in the train of His triumph as well
According to 1:21 and 22, we must be firmly attached to Christ, we must be anointed by God, and we must be sealed with the Spirit
All this is that we may scatter the incense of our Savior, the incense of the One whom we love to the uttermost
We can live Christ because we have Christ, and we have Christ because we have been attached, anointed, and sealed
A brother who has been partially captured by Christ may say to himself, 'Tomorrow is the Lord's Day once again
Whenever you sense that part of you is not willing to be captured by the Lord, remember that you have been attached, anointed, and sealed
My point here is that whenever the Lord demands that we do something, He will most assuredly supply us for that matter
When we have been attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led, we shall scatter the incense of Christ
In the book of 2 Corinthians, a very deep book, Paul presents himself as a pattern of living Christ for the church
He may be regarded as one who touched not only the 'skin' of the revelation in the Bible, but also began to see the 'meat' under the skin
There Paul says, 'God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
Certain ones who saw only the robe and not the fatted calf only the skin and not the meat were not happy with this kind of gospel preaching
The son came back home because he was hungry, so hungry that he was even willing to feed on the husks that were given to swine
Some who care only for the robe and not for the fatted calf go so far as to say that our teaching is heretical
Since our spirit has been joined to the Lord as one spirit, our spirit should be the predominant part of our being
Those who follow this practice claim that letters of recommendation were written for the saints during Paul's time
Rather, his intention was to speak concerning the writing of living letters by the life-giving Spirit of the living God
The book of Revelation says clearly that Christ is the alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and also the omega, the last letter
No matter how long a particular composition may be, it is written with words composed of the letters of the alphabet
Anyone who lives Christ for the church knows Christ as alpha, beta, gamma, delta and every other letter of the heavenly alphabet
If Paul were to speak with you for a period of time, a certain amount of Christ, perhaps a paragraph, would be written on your heart
The saints will receive not only the knowledge of doctrine, but the actual inscribing of Christ in their hearts
If a brother has Christ inscribed into him, he will experience being one spirit with the Lord in his married life
Paul, a pattern of living Christ for the church, was made competent, sufficient, qualified, to write living letters
These saints will not preach the gospel merely in a doctrinal way; they will write Christ into the inner being of others
We want to go deeper than the feathers and skin to touch the meat of Christ to experience Christ as the deep things of God to be our portion
Some have spent a great deal of time to gain academic knowledge, but they do not have much of Christ written into them
Some have a thorough knowledge of the Greek language; however, they do not experience Christ as all the letters of the heavenly alphabet
Young people, when you visit your parents, be assured that they are reading the Christ who has been written into you
Of being offended or discouraged, you need to realize that your parents are reading the Christ who has been inscribed into you
Young people, when you visit your parents, you should exhibit Christ to them, but you should not perform in any way
Neither should you try to defend the Lord's recovery by arguing with your parents or by claiming to know many things
What a young person is in his being especially convinces his parents, for every parent desires good things to happen to his children
Of merely teaching doctrines to others or only teaching the Bible, we must do the unique work of writing living letters of Christ
Praise the Lord, the heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches
Being anointed with the Spirit and filled with the life-giving Spirit, we shall have the Spirit as the ink to write Christ into others
The title of this message is 'Competent of Christ as the Alphabet to Write Living Letters with the Life-giving Spirit of the Living God'
In certain fundamental groups the believers are taught that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate and distinct Persons
The Father exists in the Son and the Spirit; the Son exists in the Father and the Spirit; and the Spirit exists in the Father and the Son
Other Christians may go by the decrees of the councils and follow the creeds, but we follow the entire Bible, the pure Word of God
Although we cannot systematize God, we can be competent of Christ to write living letters with the Spirit of the living God
Let us pray that many of us will go forth to write living letters with the life-giving Spirit of the living God
Many of the sermons given in today's Christian circles are either in the category of feathers or in the category of skin
Few messages given among Christians take the listeners deeper than the skin and help them touch the genuine meat of the Word
Prior to World War II, books were still being published that contained some weighty messages dealing with the meat of the Word
When we with unveiled face behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done
As we have seen, the Spirit is mentioned with the bride; that is, the Spirit is mentioned with something additional
When a young brother gets married, he is no longer single, no longer a bachelor, for he gains a wife as an addition
According to John 129 John declared when he saw the Lord Jesus coming to him Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!
According to the third chapter of the Gospel of John, John the Baptist later spoke of the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom
Some of John's disciples were jealous because of the fact that so many were coming to the Lord Jesus and following Him
They said to John, 'Rabbi, He Who was with you across the Jordan, of Whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him'
By this we see that the Lord Jesus is not only the Lamb of God, but He is also the Bridegroom who deserves to have the bride
The provision of Eve to be a counterpart for Adam also illustrates that marriage involves a man gaining a wife to be his addition
Just as it was not good for Adam to be alone, single, so it is not good for God to be alone, to be a 'bachelor'
If we grasp the inward reality of the Word, we shall realize that God will never be satisfied with mere outward worship from His creatures
We should not be fully satisfied with any kind of teaching or preaching that does not serve the meat of the Bible
The One who was born in a manger in Bethlehem and who grew up in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth was the very mighty God
The ointment, however, was constituted not only of oil; it was made of oil to which four spices had been added
The Spirit comprises all that the Triune God is, all that He has accomplished, and all that He has achieved, obtained, and attained
Many Christians have been cheated and even drugged by teachings that go no further than the feathers and skin in the Word
We all need to grow and mature so that we may be qualified at the Lord's coming to be included as part of His bride
According to John 17 when the Lord Jesus was about to die He prayed Father the hour has come glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You
We may use the blossoming of a carnation flower as an illustration of what it means for the Lord Jesus to be glorified
Because a carnation seed dies when it is sown into the soil, we may say that its blossoming is its resurrection
With this understanding, now we are able to answer the question concerning what the glory of the new covenant is
To say that Paul was shining forth the glory of the new covenant means that he lived out the resurrected Christ
The glory of the new covenant is the reality of the resurrected Christ who is now the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit indwelling our spirit
We need to live this resurrected Christ by walking and behaving ourselves daily and even moment by moment in our spirit
The Spirit must not only permeate our inward parts; it must even saturate our physical bodies and thereby make them the members of Christ
In particular, the parents of the young people should be able to read the Christ who has been inscribed into their children
Living Christ by shining forth His glory in resurrection is very different from merely trying to improve our behavior in an outward way
The revelation in the New Testament is that we live Christ, not that we have mere outward improvement of our behavior
He desires even to saturate our physical bodies making our bodies healthy strong and living and causing them to become the members of Christ
Living Christ by being saturated with Him and shining Him forth is very different from having a life that is simply ethical or moral
The second aspect involves being attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led to scatter the incense of Christ
They were also one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God; that is, they were one with the Christ who is the Yes
As those attached to the anointed One, they were also captured, subdued, and led by God to celebrate Christ's victory
As captives marching in Christ's triumphal procession, they scattered the incense of Christ wherever they went
The apostles' journey of ministry was not an ordinary journey; it was a triumphal procession celebrating Christ's victory in the universe
Paul and his coworkers were also competent of Christ as the heavenly alphabet to write living letters of Christ with Christ and for Christ
Daily and even hourly, they were also in the process of being transformed into the same image, the image of the glorified Christ
According to the book of 2 Corinthians, the pattern of living Christ for the church includes the aspect of daily transformation
The King James Version renders this Greek word transformed in Romans 12:2, but translates it as changed in 2 Corinthians 3:18
As we receive this supply, it replaces the old element within us and causes it to be discharged and carried away
Otherwise, Paul would not have said that we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit
Day by day and hour by hour Christ, the heavenly chicken, is being added to us, and we are being transformed into His image
We were subdued, and now we are here in the meeting testifying that we have read the Christ who has been written in our daughter'
If the parents of this young person had the adequate understanding, they would speak not merely of change, but of transformation
The ethical teachings of Confucius may be compared to copper but what the Bible reveals regarding the Christian life may be compared to gold
The submission taught by Paul in Ephesians 5 is golden, but the threefold submission taught by Confucius is copper
That kind of teaching would do nothing more than help the saints to polish their copper and cause it to shine more brightly
Let us take as an example a young person in the church life who is submissive to his parents and obedient to them
Once we were going from copper to copper, but now we are being transformed from gold to gold, from glory to glory
We are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit
We have seen that, as a pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church, Paul was daily experiencing transformation
Transformation in 3:18, a metabolic change, is from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit
If, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we shall be mirrors beholding and reflecting Him with unveiled face
Many Christians cannot behold and reflect the Lord because they are covered by a thick veil or perhaps several layers of veils
Consider how many people there are in today's Catholicism, and how many have been veiled by the influence of Catholicism
Suppose there were no such thing as Catholicism and all those in Catholicism were unbelievers who did not know anything about God
If you try to speak to those in Catholicism concerning God's New Testament economy, you will discover that the majority are veiled
In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas
If you are a quiet person, you may prefer to worship God in a cathedral that has a high ceiling and stained glass windows and is dimly lit
Paul's word about beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face was written with his background in Judaism in mind
Because Paul taught that the law was over and that circumcision was no longer necessary, many Jews were not willing to listen to him
Their doctrine regarding the law and circumcision was a veil that kept them from seeing the Christ preached by Paul
In addition to religious veils and the veils of our natural concepts, we are also veiled by our racial and national character
Differences of national character can make it difficult for believers from different countries to worship together
The various national characters, dispositions, habits, and customs are veils that keep us from beholding and reflecting the Lord
Some who have been in the church life in the Lord's recovery for many years may be veiled by their concept of what is the best way to meet
With an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image from glory to glory
The word essence is related to what Paul says concerning the glory and superiority of the ministry of the new covenant in 3:7-11
The Greek word means to serve something to someone, for example, as a waiter serves in a restaurant or a stewardess on an airplane
In such a case, there would be a writer and an instrument, but there would not be any ink as the necessary writing essence
In the church life in the Lord's recovery, do you not have the sense that you are under a spiritual inscribing?
The old covenant ministry was a ministry of death; the new covenant ministry is a ministry of life embodied in the Spirit
Under the influence of tradition, we also may not pay adequate attention to the Spirit as the essence inscribed into us
The Amplified New Testament renders the Greek words translated from glory to glory as 'from one degree of glory to another'
In 3:9 Paul goes on to say, 'For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
As the old covenant ministry was of death and condemnation, so the new covenant ministry is of the Spirit and of righteousness
The new covenant ministry has an essence in two aspects: the first aspect is of the Spirit, and the second aspect is of righteousness
If we would answer this question, we need to realize that Paul places righteousness in the same category as the Spirit
The new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, both of which are aspects of the essence of this ministry
Just as a table may be constituted of wood and of paint, so the new covenant ministry is constituted of the Spirit and of righteousness
The substance of the new covenant ministry is the Spirit, and the expression, the appearance, is righteousness
Anyone who has been inscribed with the Spirit of the living God will have an expression of righteousness in his daily living
Because the brother is experiencing the Spirit inwardly as the substance, he expresses righteousness in his life at home
When we live Christ and experience something in us that is substantial and active, we become right in closing windows and doors
If those ones experience the Spirit as the substance within them, they will become right even with their shoes and clothes
If you experience the Spirit inwardly and express righteousness outwardly, others will realize that something is different about you
You are not only right in so many ways, and you are not only righteous, but you have God Himself as your righteousness
The work of the new covenant ministry is altogether different from that of most of today's preachers and teachers
If we are careless with our things or in the way we close a door, this is an indication that we are not living Christ
If the Bible contained a rule for every aspect of our daily living, it would be too big for any of us to carry
We have seen that to be transformed into the Lord's image from glory to glory is to be transformed from the Spirit to the Spirit
If we experience such an inward transformation, spontaneously we shall have righteousness as our outward appearance
Although the New Testament clearly indicates that the ministry is one and unique, it also speaks of different ministries
We cannot accept a ministry that is seeking to establish or accomplish something different from God's unique operation
If you make such a study you will see that the different ministries services are all for the carrying out of the one new covenant ministry
Teaching does not require any essence; however, inscribing does require an essence, just as writing with a pen requires ink
Peter did not do one kind of inscribing with one kind of essence, and Paul a different kind of inscribing with a different kind of essence
In Acts 16:7 we read of the Spirit of Jesus; in Romans 8:9, of the Spirit of Christ; and in Philippians 1:19, of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
In the New Testament the emphasis is not on walking in the Holy Spirit or in the Spirit of God; the emphasis is on walking in the Spirit
How will you be able to express the truth concerning the steps through which God has passed to become the all-inclusive Spirit?
In the Bible certain words are not used; however, there are facts which give us reason to use particular words to describe them
The adjective form of the word trinity is triune, composed of two Latin roots: tri-, meaning three, and -une, meaning one
Because the Bible reveals that God is triune, what is wrong with using the word Trinity to speak of God as the Father, Son, and Spirit?
What is wrong in saying that God today is the processed God, that He is no longer the unprocessed God, the 'raw' God?
Some may say that the Lord's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection were simply procedures, not a process
The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man
By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married and become a universal couple
Perhaps even as you have been reading this message, something of the divine essence has been inscribed into you
You may not remember the points of the message, but what has been inscribed into you of the divine essence will never be erased
Christians have this concept because the Old Testament speaks of three classes of people-the priests, the kings, and the prophets
It was not a case of Peter having a ministry, John having another ministry, and James having yet another ministry
Throughout the centuries there have been only two ministries: the ministry of the old covenant and the ministry of the new covenant
The reason Christians have been divided into groups and denominations is that they have invented many different kinds of ministries
The Pentecostals also have their own kind of ministry, a ministry that emphasizes tongue-speaking, healing, and miracles
When we say that the new covenant ministry is unique, we do not mean that it is the ministry of only one person
Whoever ministers the Spirit and righteousness to others is one in the unique ministry, no matter who he may be
When you say that there is one ministry, that the ministry is unique, do you mean that your ministry is this unique ministry'?
As a Christian, or as one who regards himself as having a certain kind of ministry, what kind of ministry do you have?
If you are not in the ministry of the Spirit and righteousness and not in the ministry of death and condemnation, in what ministry are you?
They expect that when they speak in the power of the Spirit, a large number of people will be gained for the Lord
In 1 Corinthians Paul mentions tongue-speaking, for example, with the intention of limiting this practice in the church meetings
The ministry of the new covenant is a matter of the Spirit as the supply inwardly and of righteousness as God's expression outwardly
In 2 Corinthians 3:8 Paul speaks of the ministry of the Spirit, and in verse 9, of the ministry of righteousness
If he had said that the new covenant ministry was a ministry of justification, it would be easy to understand his meaning
To be sure, it is a very significant matter that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness
If we would understand what the ministry of righteousness is, we must first have a proper understanding of righteousness
To take in the heretical thought that there is no resurrection is to allow one's self to be drugged, to be put into a drugged condition
If we did not have the new covenant ministry, we would not have the Spirit, and we would not have righteousness
Before you experienced the Spirit in this way, it may have been very easy for you to argue with your wife or husband
Although nothing is said concerning this, it is nevertheless a fact that in the meeting the Spirit is ministered to you
There is a ministry in the recovery which inscribes the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit into our being
Although there is no message and even no word of encouragement, the life-giving Spirit is ministered into my being
Immediately, without effort, we know the mind of the Lord and have a clear understanding concerning His will and work
Even when we do not do anything wrong we still may not be right with God, for our being may not be in the mind and will of the Lord
In order to answer this question, we need to see that in the Word righteousness refers in the first place to the fulfilling of the law
We should not take the Lord's name in vain, and we should recognize that the Sabbath is a day of memorial of God as the unique Creator
By studying carefully the first four commandments, we see that these commandments indicate that God is jealous
Just as a woman's husband is separate from all other men and thus is not common, so God is separate from everything else and is not common
According to the description of God contained in the Ten Commandments, God is holy and righteous and He is a God of love and light
It is right not to murder, not to commit fornication, not to steal, not to bear false witness, and not to covet
According to the biblical meaning, righteousness is the keeping of the law to present to others an image, an expression, of God
If we are righteous, full of righteousness, this righteousness becomes the expression of the God we worship and serve
The purpose of the ministry of the new covenant is to minister into the saints the life-giving Spirit and righteousness
Christ living within us is the life-giving Spirit, and Christ expressed through us is righteousness as the image of God
In verse 9 Paul goes on to say For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth'
If we put these verses together, we see that the new man is created in the image of God and that with this image there is righteousness
Is this a ministry or service that teaches others to speak in tongues or instructs them to be baptized in a certain way?
In every aspect and in every way, the new covenant ministry dispenses Christ into us as the life-giving Spirit
Simultaneously, the new covenant ministry presents Christ to us as righteousness, as the living image of God to be His expression
Paul desired to be found in Christ, not having anything of himself as righteousness, but having Christ as the righteousness of God
For a better understanding of the ministry of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3, we need to consider some key verses in Romans 8
We must walk according to the Spirit of life so that the righteous requirements of the law may be fulfilled in us
If we do not live in the Spirit of life and do not walk according to this Spirit and yet try to keep the law, we shall not succeed
Let us now consider in more detail how the law of God, the Ten Commandments, is fulfilled in us when we walk according to the Spirit of life
The same is true regarding the third commandment, the commandment about not taking the name of the Lord in vain
If we live Christ, if we live and walk in the Spirit of life, spontaneously and unconsciously we shall honor our parents
Eventually, if you live and walk in the Spirit of life in your relationship with your parents, they will be convinced
Because the way of the Lord's recovery was new to them and strange to their understanding, they opposed their children
He has been victorious simply because the saints have lived in the Spirit of life and walked according to the Spirit
When the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us because we walk according to the Spirit, then we have righteousness
Because we have this expression as the spontaneous righteousness we live out by the Spirit of life, others can be convinced and subdued
For this reason, those who oppose us may eventually be convinced by seeing the expression of God lived out of us
Day by day, we need to walk according to the Spirit of life so that we may fulfill the righteousness of the law
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Hebrews 1:8 and 9 say, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom
Suppose that instead of murmuring, criticizing, or gossiping, there are forbearance, praise, calling on the Lord, and fellowship
The goal of the new covenant ministry is to minister the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God into others to be their supply
It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
If we would have a share in this bride who is adorned with bright shining pure righteousness we need to adorn ourselves with righteousness
We produce it by walking daily according to the Spirit of life and by having a life that is a life of the Spirit
Speaking of the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:11 says, 'Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal'
Today we are preparing our bridal gown, a gown that will have the appearance of righteousness, which is the expression of God
Peter 3:13 says, 'Nevertheless, we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness'
To say that righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth means that everything will be in order, headed up, and regulated
Everything will be governed controlled and under the proper rule for the throne of God the kingdom the divine administration will be there
When righteousness dwells in the new heaven and new earth, the situation will be very different from what it is today
Praise the Lord that in the church, where we have a foretaste of the new heaven and the new earth, righteousness dwells!
When He issued the decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens , He said some important things concerning righteousness
He went on to say, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we read 38 9 and 16 through 18 we can see clearly that eventually all the ministers of the new covenant become one with their ministry
For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
Notice that verse 8 says that the ministry of the new covenant is in glory, and verse 9 says that this ministry abounds in glory
With the ministry of the Spirit there is glory, but this ministry does not abound in glory, for there is not yet any righteousness
Perhaps after a period of time the husband, the wife, and the child all live out righteousness according to the Spirit of life within them
Whenever the ministry of the Spirit is lived out in us with the expression of righteousness, the ministry abounds in glory
Apart from their living, there is no need for them to do any work, for their living is their work, their ministry
What counts in the new covenant ministry is what the ministers of the new covenant are in their living and in their being
The situation of the ministers of the new covenant is very different from that of many of today's Christian preachers
They may teach others to be according to a certain high standard, but they themselves do not live according to this standard
The very God who commanded light to shine out of darkness has shined in the hearts of the new covenant ministers
They are able to exalt Christ as the Lord in their preaching and conduct themselves as slaves to the believers in their service
The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ's gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our hearts
Some people actually believe that if they lay a material cross upon someone who is ill, that cross has the power to heal him
In 4:7 Paul goes on to say, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
Because of our background, a background of religion full of doctrine, we do not regard doctrine as something pleasant or tasteful
In chapter three, in particular, we have the doctrine that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness
We may say that 2 Corinthians 3 is experientially doctrinal and that 2 Corinthians 4 is doctrinally experiential
Having such an understanding of these two chapters is essential to grasping what we shall cover in this message
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh'
In chapter four Paul gives us an experiential confirmation of the points he has just made regarding the new covenant ministry
What Paul says in chapter four regarding his experience, therefore, must emphasize the crucial points covered in chapter three
In a chapter concerning doctrine Paul speaks of the Spirit, but in a chapter concerning experience he speaks of life
We may use the difference between groceries and cooked food to illustrate the difference between the Spirit and life
For the time being, we shall not seek to find what element in chapter four corresponds to righteousness in chapter three
The glory in chapter three is dispensationally weighty in this age, but the glory in chapter four is eternally weighty
In other words, in chapter three glory has a weight for this age, but in chapter four glory has a weight of eternity
As we have seen, the Spirit becomes life, transformation becomes renewing, and the dispensational glory becomes the eternal glory
When Paul was with the Corinthians, he did have problems and difficulties, and he did encounter opposition and persecution
Paul knew that if everything had been easy and comfortable, it would not have been possible to have the same manifestation of life
The Chinese version says that they were attacked in every way, attacked from four directions: the front, the rear, the right, and the left
Even though he experienced affliction, perplexity, persecution, and being cast down, Paul was still very living
By presenting his own experience as a confirmation of his ministry, Paul indicated that he and his ministry were one
In 2 Corinthians 4 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, 'Our living and our being are the confirmation of our ministry
We are afflicted in every way, that is, according to the meaning of the Greek, we are afflicted from every side
In chapter four he presents a life that confirms the claim that the new covenant ministers and the new covenant ministry are one
In the foregoing message we pointed out that 2 Corinthians 3 is a chapter on doctrine and that 2 Corinthians 4 is a chapter on experience
For each of the major points regarding the ministry in chapter three, there is a corresponding point in chapter four
Peter 3:13 says, 'Nevertheless, we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness'
In spite of the trouble that comes to you from every side, you remain in such an orderly and peaceful condition
If you find yourself in that kind of situation and yet everything becomes calm and orderly, that is the manifestation of life
If you experience this in your family life, your children will be calmed down, and your husband or wife will be subdued
According to Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 3, the new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness
In 416 Paul says Wherefore we do not lose heart but if indeed our outward man is decaying yet our inward man is being renewed day by day
On the one hand, the falling of the leaves from a tree is an active matter, but in another sense, it is passive
Do not cry out for help to preserve your outward man, and do not ask to be rescued from those things or persons who are consuming you
Sometimes when you make a mistake, your wife will be very kind to you and tell you not to be concerned about it
There is a reason: God in His sovereignty allows her to do so in order that you, as a tree, may drop your leaves
On the one hand, a tree drops its leaves on its own; on the other hand, the season and the environment force a tree to do this
When autumn comes, a tree must drop its leaves, no matter how green and flourishing it has been during the summer
When the autumn and winter seasons come in the Christian life, we may be afflicted by the members of our family
When we experience the decaying of our outward man, we may tell the Lord that we are not able to take it any longer
The Lord, however, may indicate that we shall take it much longer, for our destiny is to have the outward man consumed
In the same principle, when we experience the decaying of the outward man, we enjoy the renewing of the inward man
In the process of transformation a divine element is added into our being, and we are constituted of this element
In presenting the life he lived as a minister of the new covenant, Paul uses the name Jesus in a very particular way
The Gospels are not primarily an account of the Lord's marvelous works; they are a description of the life the Lord Jesus lived on earth
If you read the Gospels carefully, you will see that the picture in them was not painted as an account of the Lord's works
The Gospels do describe the Lord's works, but much more they present the life Jesus lived and show us by what way He lived
There are a number of indications in the Gospels that the Lord Jesus did not care for the accomplishing of a great work
They took palm branches and went out to meet Him crying Hosanna blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord even the King of Israel!
When Andrew and Philip told the Lord that the Greeks were seeking Him, He answered, 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified
The One who went to the cross to accomplish redemption for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose was not a great worker
He was a man raised in the home of a carpenter from Nazareth, a despised town from the despised district of Galilee
As he was driving, he pointed out the window and said of the people in the Scottish countryside that many of them had never heard of Jesus
Paul, however, was always being delivered unto death so that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh
Now we can understand that the apostles were not followers of a great person, but of a small man, Jesus of Nazareth
Instead of being exalted, they were always being put to death so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in their mortal flesh
In 410 Paul says Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body
In 2 Corinthians 4 we see the aspect not of redemption and not of the imparting of life, but of destroying, consuming
Although the man Jesus was God incarnate, God becoming a man, it was necessary even for His outward man to be consumed
The Lord Jesus died for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, not merely for the accomplishment of redemption
Before He was literally crucified by the Romans, Jesus had been repeatedly crucified by His mother, His brothers, and His disciples
Now we can understand that the Lord Jesus was crucified not only during the six hours He was on a literal cross
Through our natural birth we became persons of the old creation, and through regeneration we have become persons of the new creation
In the church life in the Lord's recovery, instead of being enthroned, he will experience the putting to death of Jesus
The reason is that the Lord is using different persons to nail this sister to the cross, that is, to consume her outward man
If they move for the purpose of avoiding the putting to death of Jesus, they may experience even more of this in a different locality
If you are not able to get through with the church in one locality, this indicates that you cannot get through in any local church
If you are still crying about the experience of being consumed, this indicates that you need more of the putting to death of Jesus
When some hear this word concerning the putting to death of Jesus they may say Oh what a terrible destiny is ours in the Lords recovery!
Paul does not speak of being buried with Jesus or crucified with Jesus, but of being raised, resurrected, with Jesus
Vincent says, 'Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both'
In 410 Paul says Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body
Some writings have said that the outward man denotes our natural man and that the inward man denotes our spiritual man
In verse 10 Paul speaks of 'bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus,' and in verse 11 he mentions the mortal flesh
Bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus is equal to the consuming, the wasting away, of the outward man
As we have pointed out, the spirit here is the mingled spirit, the regenerated human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit
According to the context, the outward man is mainly the body, and the inward man is mainly the regenerated spirit
The outward man includes our body and our soul, with the body as its organ and the soul as its life and person
It will not take very long for the sister to discover that her husband is a strong person with a strong natural life
For this reason, it is usually much more difficult for a sister to be put on the cross than it is for a brother
The outward man of the brothers can be compared to glass, but the outward man of the sisters can be compared to rubber
Some brothers and sisters have been in the church life for twenty years, and still their outward man has not been broken
The more we experience the consuming, the putting to death, of the outward man, the more our inward man is renewed
Our regenerated spirit with our renewed mind, emotion, and will needs to be resurrected, developed, enlarged, and refreshed
Only this kind of ministry can impart life to others, can minister Christ to others as the life-giving Spirit and as righteousness
In this kind of life the natural being is put to death so that the spiritual being may be resurrected, renewed, and developed
In the foregoing messages and in this message we have had much to say concerning the putting to death of Jesus
Do not apply the suffering caused by calamities in the old creation to the putting to death of Jesus in 2 Corinthians 4
Should a brother lose his job for such a reason, he should not say that this suffering is the putting to death of Jesus
The putting to death of Jesus in verse 10 is used interchangeably with being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake in verse 11
It would absolutely not be fair to regard that kind of suffering as the putting to death of Jesus, as suffering for Jesus' sake
When you survey the damage and the loss, you should not say, 'Praise the Lord, this is an experience of the putting to death of Jesus'
You should not ascribe that kind of loss to Jesus, or think that you are experiencing the putting to death of Jesus
When you suffer purely for Jesus' sake and for the sake of the church, the Body, that is the putting to death of Jesus
Asceticism involves gradual suicide, a slow, steady self-killing like that described in the book The Imitation of Christ
Paul and the other apostles were not wrong, and these particular sufferings were not related to any mistakes of theirs
We should not be ambitious to have some kind of position in the church life, but we should be ambitious to be well-pleasing to the Lord
That if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
In verse 19 he speaks of 'the word of reconciliation,' and in verse 20 he entreats the saints on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God
Not only do the important points in chapter five continue one another, but chapter five is itself a continuation of chapter four
For our body as our earthly tabernacle house to be taken down is for our outward man to be consumed, wasted away
Sometimes during a funeral service a minister may say that the deceased has gone away, that he has departed and is no longer with us
In verse 5 Paul says, 'Now He Who has wrought us for this very thing is God, Who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit'
He shapes him by forgiving his sins, putting the divine life into him to regenerate his spirit, and then transforming his soul
He has placed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit to guarantee that one day He will clothe us with a body of resurrection
Through the new covenant ministry we are shaped, qualified, and prepared to be clothed upon with a body of resurrection
Verse 9 gives the answer: 'Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to Him'
In such a way the apostles were constrained by the love of Christ to live to Him and to be well-pleasing to Him
When we are constrained, we are limited, as if walking on a narrow, walled road, and forced to go in a certain direction
It is difficult to explain what it means to live to Christ, although it is easy to understand what it means to live for Him
If we consider the context, we shall see that to live to the Lord means to live the kind of life the Lord Jesus lived
He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated
In the proper church life, the leading ones and the serving ones do not know others according to the outward man
The new creation is a person regenerated with the life of God and living in the inward man, not in the outward man
If we have such a living, we shall certainly be a new creation, a person living in the spirit, in the inward man
They are a new creation , not according to the old nature of flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life
On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God'
He says, 'We are ambassadors, as God entreating through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God'
Paul's word in verse 20 about being reconciled to God is not directed to sinners; it is directed to the believers in Corinth
In 1 Corinthians chapter one Paul refers to them as saints, as those who had been called by God into the fellowship of His Son
In verse 20 it is the believers, those who have already been reconciled to God, who are to be reconciled to Him further
In this aspect for us He was made sin to be judged and done away with by God that we may become the righteousness of God in Him
A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen
The Corinthian believers had been reconciled to God, for they had passed through the first veil and had entered into the Holy Place
They needed to pass the second veil, which has already been rent , to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit
He was working on the Corinthians to cut the veil of the flesh asunder, to crucify their natural life, to consume their outward man
How could she and her husband live peacefully together, since he has a strong disposition and she is very peculiar?
Since conversation invariably leads to disagreement, the husband may tell his wife that it is better for them not to talk
The husband begins to condemn his disposition, the wife condemns her peculiarity, and they both condemn their natural life
If this is the situation of this couple, they will be in a condition that may be called the righteousness of God
The fact that righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth indicates that everything will be brought back to God in full
Sometimes in a certain local church the condition may be such that everything, everyone, and every matter is justified by God
Christ died on the cross not only for our sins, but He died also for us, for our flesh, our natural being, our outward man
Christ died on the cross so that our outward man, our natural being, may be terminated in order that we may become God's righteousness
In verse 21 Paul says that Christ was made sin on our behalf so that we might become God's righteousness in Him
When He was crucified, He brought our natural man, the outward man, the flesh, sin, to the cross and nailed it there
The conclusion of these chapters on the new covenant ministry and its ministers is simply the righteousness of God
In particular, the Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate us, to bring God's life into our deadened spirit and to make our spirit alive
To be regenerated is not the same as being born of our parents to receive physical life; it is to be born of God to receive spiritual life
If we would understand the meaning of transformation, we need to use terms such as constitution and reorganization
Used with respect to transformation, the word constitution means that a certain new element is added into our being and constituted into us
They are distinct, but they are not separate, for they have been mingled together and constituted into one entity, one drink
It would not be true to say that this mingling produces a third substance, something which is neither divine nor human
From the time we were regenerated, a process of constitution and transformation has been taking place within us
In the first few centuries of church history certain ancient teachers of the Bible saw the matter of mingling, experienced it, and taught it
We have learned that some throughout the centuries continued to teach in a proper way concerning the mingling of divinity with humanity
In the case of oil mingled with flour to make a cake to be used in the meal offering two substances-flour and oil-were mingled together
The mingling of the oil with the flour did not produce a third nature, a substance which was neither flour nor oil
The mingling of the oil with the fine flour indicates that in Christ divinity was not merely added to humanity but was mingled with it
It is not possible for the head to be of one substance and the members of the body to be of a different substance
We would emphasize once again that the mingling of divinity with humanity in us does not produce a third nature
These two kinds of thread were not merely put side by side or piled one on the other; they were woven together into one textile
Neither our humanity nor God's divinity will be changed; however, they are being mingled together in one entity, one being
In 2:12-3:11 Paul covers the ministry of the new covenant, and in 3:12-7:16, the ministers of the new covenant
The section in this Epistle on the ministers of the new covenant is much longer than the section on the ministry of the new covenant
Today both in the Christian world and the secular world more attention is given to what people do than to what they are
Christians mainly pay their attention to work or ministry, yet neglect the being of the person who does the work
If we care only for what we do and not for being the right kind of person, then what we do will not be very weighty
In 6:1 Paul says, 'And working together with Him, we also entreat you that you do not receive the grace of God in vain'
If Paul, who thought of himself as less than the least of all the saints, could be a minister and an apostle, how about you?
As used in 2 Corinthians gift does not refer to miraculous gifts and power does not have the connotation commonly given by Christians today
If you read carefully through the entire book of 2 Corinthians, you will see that Paul's concentration is on life
If you consider what is contained in these verses, you will see that they describe a life which certainly is all-fitting
As we shall see in a later message, here Paul mentions eighteen qualifications, three groups of items, and seven kinds of persons
My understanding was that before we were saved, we were enemies of God, and there was no peace between us and God
When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, His blood washed away our sins, and we received God's forgiveness
According to the Bible, to bring others to God means to bring them into God and to make them absolutely one with Him
According to the concept held by many Christians, to be one with God can be compared to a wife being one with her husband
What a shame that some Christians oppose this wonderful biblical concept of being one with God by being mingled with Him!
Paul was commissioned with the work of bringing the believers into God in a way that was absolute and practical
Once we see this, we are qualified to understand the last part of chapter five and the first part of chapter six
You may have studied religious books or spiritual books and feel that you have the proper interpretation of reconciliation
Because we are not in the Lord ourselves in a practical way in our work, we cannot reconcile anyone else into the Lord
The extent to which we can bring others to God and into God is always measured by where we are with respect to God
In the latter part of 6:1 Paul says to the Corinthians, 'We also entreat you that you do not receive the grace of God in vain'
By this grace Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners , became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the apostles
The phrase 'well-acceptable time' refers to the time of our being reconciled to God, in which He well-accepts us
In these verses Paul is a pattern of a believer who has been fully saved, a pattern of one who lives an all-fitting life
From 6:3 to the end of chapter seven, the apostle depicts a life that is all-fitting for carrying out the new covenant ministry
In verse 3 Paul says, 'We are giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that the ministry may not be blamed'
In verses 4 through 7 Paul gives us the first category of qualifications of the ministers of God, the ministers of the new covenant
If one is cast into prison and then made subject to trial over a period of years, endurance is absolutely necessary
Literally the Greek word rendered distresses means narrowness of room; hence, straits, difficulties, distresses
Some translators even reverse the order of these words in verse 4, using distresses for afflictions, and afflictions for distresses
His life, the life that qualified him to be a new covenant minister, was a life of endurance, affliction, necessities, and distresses
According to Acts 16:23, in Philippi Paul and Silas had many stripes laid upon them and then were cast into prison
In Ephesians 3:1 Paul refers to himself as 'the prisoner of Christ Jesus,' and in Ephesians 4:1, as 'the prisoner in the Lord'
In 2 Corinthians 11:23 Paul says that he was 'in labors more abundantly,' and in verse 27, speaks of 'in labor and hardship'
Watchings refer to sleeplessness, such as those experienced by the apostles in Acts 16:25; 20:7-11, 31; and 2 Thessalonians 3:8
Hunger may refer to a situation in which there is no way to obtain food; involuntary fasting may refer to a situation of poverty
Verse 6 continues, 'In pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love'
Paul's inclusion of 'in knowledge' indicates that no minister of the New Testament should be an unintelligent person
Endurance may emphasize the strength or capacity to bear suffering, and longsuffering may emphasize the duration of that suffering
In order to be a minister of the New Testament, we must realize that nothing can be accomplished for God's eternal purpose without suffering
You will have some joy in your married life or family life, but you will also have suffering, probably more suffering than joy
Weapons of righteousness are used to fight for being right with God and men according to the righteousness of God
Weapons on the right hand, like the sword, are offensive, and those on the left hand, such as the shield, are defensive
If we would be proper ministers of the new covenant, in our experience we shall always receive two kinds of appraisals
Some will give us glory and say we are excellent; others will accuse us of being miserable and pitiful and will heap dishonor upon us
If you are faithful to the Lord and honest with the church and the saints, you will receive evil reports as well as good reports
We also should be those who are put to death, those who are as dying, and also those who are living in resurrection
As we are suffering, those with a very superficial view of things may say, 'These people are under God's punishment
We should also check with ourselves concerning the first eighteen qualifications and concerning the three groups of things
On the one hand, we should seem to be as deceivers, as unknown, as dying, as disciplined, as made sorrowful, as poor, and as having nothing
On the other hand, we should be true, well known, living, not put to death, always rejoicing, enriching many, and possessing all things
The Corinthian believers, being childish , were straitened, contracted, in their inward parts toward the apostles
Paul's use of the word children in verse 13 indicates that the Corinthian believers were childish, in the apostle's consideration
Writing in this way, the apostle was carrying out his ministry of reconciling the believers, who were but halfway in being reconciled to God
If, as a New Testament believer, you are not an adequate minister of the new covenant, you have not yet been fully saved
If we have been fully saved and have an all-fitting life, then any situation or circumstance is right for us to minister life to others
Not only the apostles and the elders should have such a heart, but every believer in Christ should have a large heart
As long as we have the eighteen qualifications with 'in,' the three with 'through,' and the seven with 'as,' we have truly been enlarged
From experience we know that our labor for the Lord will stir up opposition, and this opposition results in tumults
It is significant that in Paul's listing endurance and affliction come first, and the word of truth and the power of God come last
Paul is emphasizing an all-fitting life, a life that fits into every situation and does not cause others to stumble
The apostles had been commissioned with this ministry to bring God's people into Him and to make them one with Him organically
Since righteousness is an attribute of God, to become God's righteousness in Christ is to become this divine attribute
As long as certain parts of us are not saved, in those parts of our being there is a discrepancy between us and God
In 6:1 Paul says to the Corinthians, 'And working together with Him, we also entreat you that you do not receive the grace of God in vain'
To receive the grace of God in vain means to receive grace without making any progress in the matter of being saved
In verse 1, however, Paul does not speak about receiving God's grace; he warns about receiving God's grace in vain
If we have all these characteristics of the all-fitting life, all the items with 'in,' 'through,' and 'as,' we have truly been enlarged
Regarding the Lord's word in Matthew 10:16 to be 'prudent as serpents,' these straight ones could not at all be 'as serpents'
Rather, we should continue to be strict and straight concerning ourselves, but we should not apply this principle to others
It is also an indication that we are not able to reconcile others to God, for we ourselves have not been fully reconciled to Him
Once a certain brother has been offended by his wife, he may never forget that offense and never forgive his wife for causing it
If you are able to forgive an offense and forget it, that is a sign that you have become an enlarged person, a person with a large heart
In 6:14 Paul does not care for the teaching of the law; he cares for the spiritual significance of this requirement
Any brother in that situation needs to cast off that unequal yoke in business and be reconciled, brought back, into God
Young brothers and sisters, if you have close friendships with unbelievers, that will cause you to become an unequally yoked pair
Your unbelieving friend will not help you to come closer to God; rather, an unbelieving friend will take you away from Him
As long as you maintain such an unequal friendship, you will be distracted from God more and more and taken gradually farther away from Him
In verse 14 Paul says, 'What partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness'?
If we have fellowship, or intimate friendship, with unbelievers, that kind of friendship is fellowship between light and darkness
In verse 15 Paul continues, 'And what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an unbeliever'?
The words 'what is unclean' denote that which belongs to lawlessness, darkness, Belial, and idols, as listed in verses 14 through 16
The words, 'I will welcome you,' point to God's glad receiving of the believers who are fully reconciled, brought back, to Him
Many parents who have both sons and daughters will tell you that the daughters are dear and the sons are precious
Realizing that we can be precious and dear to the Father, Paul indicates that we are both sons and daughters to Him
The defilement of flesh refers to material things; defilement of spirit, to things in the spiritual world such as idols
Holy means not only sanctified, separated, unto God; it also means different, distinct, from everything that is common
For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His divine nature and to have our entire being permeated with God Himself
To be separated from what is unclean is to be reconciled to God and sanctified unto Him; it is also to be fully saved
Being fully saved includes separation from what is unclean, sanctification unto God, and reconciliation into God
Every believer who loves the Lord and who wants to come up to God's standard should become a minister of the new covenant
The goal of the Lord's recovery today is to recover this ministering of Christ by all the believers so that the church may be built up
For us all to be church builders, to minister Christ for the building up of the church, we need a ministering life
We may take this as an illustration of believers who may be 'spiritual,' 'holy,' and 'victorious,' but are fruitless
It is possible to become knowledgeable in spiritual matters and powerful in preaching and yet still be unfruitful
A brother may even visit another locality and hold a conference, but the results of that conference may be that many are killed
Even though they are not clever, they raise their children in a very good way because they have a loving concern for them
Some step-mothers may be knowledgeable, gifted, and clever; however, they lack the necessary concern for the children
They should not merely be interested in giving excellent messages as a display of their knowledge, talent, or capability
As long as we have the proper concern for people, we are well on our way to be qualified to be used of God for their salvation
In that book, the writer, James M'Kendrick, tells us of standing in front of a group of unbelievers and weeping, without saying a word
While he is receiving that spanking, the child realizes that the mother is disciplining him with a loving spirit and attitude
To be sure, in 2 Corinthians as a whole, and especially in chapter seven, we see Paul's intimate concern for the believers
7:2 is actually a continuation of 6:11-13, entreating the believers to have their heart enlarged toward the apostles, to make room for them
For Paul to speak to the Corinthians in this way shows that between him and them there was an intimate relationship
Since we have you in our hearts and our hearts are enlarged, we appeal to you to enlarge your hearts and make room for us
The Greek here literally means the encouragement and the joy, pointing to the particular encouragement and the particular joy
In 7:2 and 3 Paul says, 'Make room for us; we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one
A woman may be lacking in education, but if she has a deep concern for her children, she is qualified to be a good mother
In verse 2 Paul says, 'Make room for us,' and in verse 3 he declares, 'You are in our hearts to die together and to live together'
The words 'caused you sorrow' in verse 8 show that the apostle's first Epistle to the believers at Corinth was effective in regard to them
Without the use of this phrase Paul in verse 8 would be strongly vindicating himself and arguing on his own behalf
Because Paul had won the case, he could easily have written something that would have been very hard for the Corinthians to accept
In speaking the truth to the Corinthians and presenting the facts, Paul knew it was difficult for him to avoid condemning the Corinthians
On the one hand, someone may be polite; on the other hand, at the same time he may be hard, haughty, and proud
Paul was pointing out to the Corinthians their shortage, but he did this in a way that was tender, soft, and sweet
After experiencing repentance unto salvation, the Corinthians realized that the situation of the church in Corinth was wrong
The Corinthian believers did love the apostles and had earnest care toward them, but they had been turned aside by false teachers
The apostle wrote the first Epistle to bring them back, that their love and earnest care toward the apostles might be made manifest to them
In our encouragement we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you'
Verse 15 says And his affections are abundantly toward you remembering the obedience of you all how you received him with fear and trembling
The Greek word rendered 'affections' here literally means bowels; it is the same word rendered 'inward parts' in 6:12
After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul was concerned about how the believers at Corinth would react to his discipline
Because of his deep concern, he was eagerly awaiting Titus to bring him news of the response of the Corinthians to his first Epistle
As we read chapter seven, we can touch the feeling in Paul's spirit, a feeling of deep concern for the church in Corinth
All those who would care for the churches or serve the Lord need to be impressed with Paul's spirit in chapter seven
We also see that in ancient times the fellowship between the believers and the apostles was not as shallow as it is among believers today
In ancient times, the believers were in the hearts of the apostles, and the apostles were in the hearts of the believers
Chapters eight and nine of 2 Corinthians are both on the matter of the apostle's fellowship concerning the ministry to the needy saints
In 2 Corinthians 6 and 7 we have Paul's work of reconciliation, and in chapters eight and nine, the ministry to the needy saints
If we would carry on a proper ministry to the needy saints, we need to be reconciled to God, brought back to Him in full
In chapter six Paul carried on this ministry, doing a fine work to reconcile the distracted Corinthians back to God in full
After accomplishing such a work, he went on to fellowship with them that they should have a ministry to supply the needy saints
Through Paul's reconciling work, the saints in Corinth were brought back to God, repented, and received more salvation
In 8:1 Paul says, 'Furthermore, we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia'
Paul does not merely talk about money; he speaks concerning the grace of God in a way that is full of life and the Spirit
If we read 8:1-15 carefully, we shall see that grace here involves four parties: God, the giving ones, the apostles, and Christ
We may speak of a fourfold grace-the grace of God, the grace of the givers, the grace of the apostles, and the grace of Christ
Throughout the centuries many believers have appreciated the communal life in Acts 2 and 4 and have also tried to have all things common
Even as early as chapter six, problems began to arise, and not too long afterward that communal life was discontinued
Whenever we are in affliction or suffering, we should realize that God is testing us to prove where we are and what we are
If we are able to withstand the test and are approved by God, the result will be the approvedness of affliction
With the Macedonians the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty 'abounded unto the riches of their liberality'
Those who are complicated may consider the matter and then decide to give much less than they originally intended
Although the Macedonians were poor and in affliction, they gave generously of their own accord, that is, voluntarily
They did this through the grace of God, through the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling them
To give continually by grace is more difficult than to put all our possessions together and have everything in common
To have a ministry that overcomes mammon and material possessions and uses them for God's purpose requires grace
Verse 4 says, 'With much entreaty beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints'
The Macedonian believers besought of the apostles the favor that they might participate have fellowship in the ministry to the needy saints
Of the apostles asking the saints to have a share in this matter, the Macedonian believers begged the apostles for such a share
They begged the apostles to let them share in this grace, to give them this grace that they might participate in such a spiritual ministry
He was one who took a ministry of material things and made it a spiritual matter full of life, the Spirit, and building up
According to their feeling, the Macedonians regarded it as a grace to participate in the ministry to the needy saints
Under the ministry of the apostles, the giving of material supply became a spiritual matter full of life and edification
In order for our material giving to become a spiritual ministry of life and building, we need grace from God and also from the apostles
Verse 5 says, 'And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God'
The Macedonians were given not only to the Lord, but also to the apostles to be one with the apostles in accomplishing their ministry
It was through the will of God, through the sovereign divine agent, that the believers gave themselves first to the Lord and to the apostles
In verse 6 Paul continues, 'So that we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete in you this grace also'
Apparently the Lord Jesus becoming poor has nothing to do with the ministry of material supply to needy saints
How could He be the grace working within us, motivating, strengthening, and supplying us to carry on a ministry to the needy saints?
When we supply needy saints with material things in the proper way, in spirit and with life, life and spirit go with this supply
Our material gifts should be spiritual, full of life, and able to edify the saints and build up the Body of Christ
It is beyond our ability to imagine the different kind of problems that can arise in relation to the handling of money
We should not consider ourselves so spiritual that we could never have a problem concerning the handling of money
In these verses we see that Paul recommended certain brothers to the Corinthian believers with respect to the ministry to the needy saints
Verses 16 and 17 say, 'But thanks be to God Who is giving the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus
Verse 18 says, 'And we sent together with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches'
Money is very much used by the Devil to seduce man into dishonesty, but it is also involved in the ministry of material things to the saints
In order to avoid blame through man's suspicion in this matter, the apostles sent a reputable brother to go with Titus as a witness
The ministry of the New Testament is altogether a matter of life, not a matter merely of gifts or of working in a particular way
The crucial question is not how we are doing things or how we are working; it is how we are living and conducting ourselves
Realizing that having the responsibility for a large amount of money could cause problems, he behaved in a very careful way
By reading this book we can see that Titus was a reputable brother, reputable among the co-workers and also among the churches
It must have been quoted from Proverbs 34 where the Septuagint reads Take thought for honorable things in the sight of the Lord and of men
Perhaps the saints themselves would not have evil thoughts, but the Devil is full of evil thoughts, and he is in them
Whenever we are about to do something or behave in a certain way, we should take forethought for the way others may think about the matter
In verse 20 Paul said, 'Avoiding this, that anyone should blame us in this abundance which is being ministered by us'
With respect to the finances of the church or of the work, or of gifts to the church or the work, we need two or three witnesses
We should not think that our situation is different from Paul's and that we do not need to take the same forethought concerning money
If He had spoken to that Samaritan woman in a room alone at night, the disciples probably would have wondered what was going on
The principle regarding all this contact and involvement is to take forethought about what others may think of us
The Apostle Paul was not only gifted, knowledgeable, and powerful; he was also cautious, careful, and considerate
As we read 2 Corinthians, we see a number of virtues and excellent characteristics in the person and life of Paul
He lived in a way that was not only holy, spiritual, and victorious, but also in a way that was careful, cautious, and considerate
These principles apply not only in the church life, but also in our family life and in our life at school, at work, or wherever we may be
In 8:15 Paul concludes, 'As it is written, He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack'
Why does the Apostle Paul connect ministering the supply of material things to the saints to the gathering of manna?
When they came out of Egypt and were wandering in the wilderness, they lived by another way, by the way of God's miracles
In Paul's writing of 2 Corinthians, he combines the gathering of manna with the believers' giving of the material supply to the needy saints
Concerning the gathering of manna, the result was the same whether the children of Israel gathered more or gathered less
Suppose a brother earns $40,000 a year, but what he actually needs for his living is much less than that amount
According to this better way, the brother should keep what he needs for his living, perhaps $20,000, and give away the remainder
If the money does not disappear in this generation, it will disappear in the following generation or certainly in the third generation
The first generation in a Christian family may become very rich and save vast riches for the second generation
You should remember that whether or not you willingly share with others, eventually the outcome will be the same
According to chapter nine, our giving equals not only our gathering, as in chapter eight, but also equals sowing
According to 9:6, he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows with blessings shall also reap with blessings
In his reading of the Old Testament he realized that Exodus 16 speaks of God's people gathering what they need for their daily supply
Whatever we give will become our gathering, as pictured by the gathering of manna by the children of Israel in the wilderness
Because his deep thought was not fully expressed in chapter eight, Paul went on to write another chapter related to giving
According to these translations, if we sow bountifully, or with bounty, we shall reap bountifully, or with bounty
If we sow with blessings to others, then, also according to natural law, we shall reap with blessings from God to us
Unwilling and grudging giving, from a withholding and covetous heart, makes the gift a matter of covetousness to the giver
In verse 7 Paul says, 'Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver'
Generous giving is, on the one hand, a blessing to the receivers, and, on the other hand, righteousness in the eyes of both God and man
In verses 14 and 15 Paul concludes And in their petition on your behalf longing after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you
In 96 Paul says But this he who sows sparingly sparingly also shall reap and he who sows with blessings with blessings also shall reap
The blessings here are first bountiful givings as blessings to others, and then bountiful harvests as blessings from God
In verse 7 Paul continues, 'Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver'
Since this was their economic situation, how could Paul encourage them, even entreat them, to supply material things to others?
Because Paul understood the situation and because he was thoughtful, he handled the matter in a very considerate way
When he fellowshipped with the believers about the material supply for the needy saints, Paul was very considerate
It is another matter to entreat the poor, those who do not have a sufficient supply for their own living, to give of their possessions
As we have pointed out, they may wonder about their future, especially about how they will earn a living if they give of what they have
There were more than two million children of Israel in a barren wilderness, in a wasteland where nothing grows
It certainly was a miracle that more than two million people could survive in the wilderness for such a long time
On the sixth day of the week, the children of Israel were allowed to gather a double portion of manna to provide a supply for the Sabbath
No doubt, as Paul studied the Scriptures, the thoughts and concepts of the Scriptures entered into him, inspired him, and governed him
From the children of Israel's experience of gathering manna in the wilderness, we learn that our income is actually a kind of manna
If we think that our income depends upon our education, ability, or skill, we are superficial and shortsighted
By using the illustration of sowing and reaping in chapter nine, Paul shows that God also uses natural law to feed His people
We need to worship the Lord and say, 'Lord, even if my supply seems to come from reaping, the food is actually given by You'
Our future also does not depend on our reaping; it depends on God's causing the seed to grow until there is a harvest
Paul, therefore, had a twofold basis on which to fellowship with the saints about the ministry of material things
He said a little about this in 1 Corinthians, but because the time was not right, he did not cover it adequately
When 1 Corinthians was written, the situation was not ready for Paul to come to the matter of his apostolic authority
In chapters ten eleven twelve and part of thirteen Paul places this matter before the Corinthians and deals with it from different angles
Because he is an excellent writer, Paul always deals with any matter thoroughly, not leaving ground for any argument
We need to be impressed with the fact that this section of 2 Corinthians stands in sharp contrast to the preceding section
Paul's word in chapters six through nine is pleasant, but at times his word in chapters ten through thirteen is severe and even unpleasant
For this reason, Paul points out that he entreated the believers through the meekness and forbearance of Christ
Suppose a brother who is giving a message cares only for his purpose in giving that message and not for the way he gives it
We should learn of Paul to pay even more attention to the way we do something than for our purpose in doing that thing
Many Christians today care hardly at all for the way of doing things; they care primarily for the purpose, the goal, the result
Christians may think that as long as their intention is to do a work for the Lord, they need not care about the means used to accomplish it
To have meekness is not to invade others, but to give in to them; to have forbearance means that you are willing to be invaded by others
The phrase 'through the meekness and forbearance of Christ' indicates that Paul was one with Christ and took Christ as his life
Regarding his person, Paul says that he was lowly when among the Corinthians, but was of good courage when absent from them
If your boldness does not evaporate after you have left a person's presence, then it may be a proper kind of boldness
He entreated them through the meekness and forbearance of Christ, and he was lowly among them, but he was bold in writing to them
In verse 3 Paul goes on to speak of spiritual warfare: 'For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh'
Since spiritual warfare is not against flesh, but against spiritual forces , the weapons should not be fleshly but spiritual
The high things in verse 5 refer to haughty things within the reprobate mentality against the knowledge of God
Paul's reference to obedience indicates that our obedience affords a base for the Lord to deal with others' disobedience
Some of them went to the Gentiles deliberately to visit the churches in order to propagate their Judaistic teachings
In 1 and 2 Corinthians we see that the believers at Corinth had been infused with Judaistic teachings and stirred up by them
It is a fighting to take captive to the obedience of Christ those thoughts which were influenced by Judaistic teachings
For this reason, Paul said that he was ready to avenge all disobedience when the obedience of the Corinthians had been fulfilled
Paul's readiness to avenge this disobedience had a condition, and this condition was the obedience of the Corinthians
When the Corinthians became utterly obedient to the New Testament gospel, the situation would be right for Paul to avenge all disobedience
If anyone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him account this again as to himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we'
Verse 8 indicates that in the past Paul did say something to the Corinthians concerning his apostolic authority
His boasting is according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure, the ruling God, has apportioned to him
When we give a testimony about our work experience or enjoyment of the Lord we must testify within measure that is within a certain limit
The reports in certain Christian publications are exaggerations; those reports go beyond measure, beyond limit, without restriction
We should not boast without measure, beyond measure, but according to the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us
Paul's words 'reach even as far as you' indicate that his coming to the Corinthians was under God's ruling and measuring
From verses 13, 14, and 15 we see that although we expect the Lord's work to spread, we must learn how to be under God's restriction
From experience we can testify that if we spread the work according to the Spirit, there will always be a certain limit
God's way, however, is first to speed us up and then to slow us down, first to raise us up and then to lower us down
The point here is that, in our concept, once the Lord's recovery begins to spread, it should spread farther and farther without restriction
Based on this principle of God's measuring, Paul told the Corinthians that whatever he did and spoke was not beyond his measure
In the church service we need to realize that God has only measured out so much to us, and we should not overstretch ourselves
Like Paul, we should move and act according to our rule, that is, according to how much God has measured to us
In his vindication of his apostolic authority, Paul conducted himself so as not to overstep the boundary of his measure
The most subtle thing in a local church is having questions concerning the apostles, concerning those who minister Christ to the churches
Paul kept this point until the last because the dealing with other matters was a condition necessary for dealing with this matter
Because it is difficult for anyone to vindicate himself, Paul found it difficult to vindicate his apostolic authority
Elsewhere in chapter ten Paul goes on to say that whereas he remained within his limit, the Judaizers went beyond their limit
According to Paul's word in 10:5, those teachings were reasonings and high things rising up against the knowledge of God
Overstretching themselves, they went out on their own and as a result interfered with the apostle's jurisdiction
In vindicating himself against the Judaizers, Paul realized that it was not becoming to mention them openly in writing
The apostles went out to preach the gospel and to teach the truth within God's measure and according to His rule
In 111315 he says concerning the Judaizers For such are false apostles deceitful workers transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ
It is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
The false apostles, being deceitful, fashioned themselves into the appearance of the real apostles, who are true in every way
The ministers of righteousness in verse 15 are the true apostles, those who carry out the ministry of righteousness
These are the Judaizers who came to Corinth to preach another Jesus with a different spirit and a different gospel
The Corinthians thought that the Judaizers were wonderful and that they did an excellent work in helping the Corinthians
Paul uses four terms to describe them: false apostles, deceitful workers, super-apostles, and ministers of Satan
In verse 1 the apostle expresses his desire that the Corinthian believers, who were bearing with him, would bear more with him
Paul's idea is this: 'Since you bear with the false apostles so well, so beautifully, so ideally, please bear more with me'
In chapter eleven of 2 Corinthians, Paul had to deal with the situation in a church that had been directly raised up by him
It is a fact that at least a number of the Corinthians accepted these teachings and were either stirred up or at least influenced by them
The problem concerning the relationship between the believers at Corinth and the Apostle Paul still needed to be solved
If you were a believer at Corinth who had accepted the teaching of the Judaizers would you have taken Pauls word concerning false apostles
The use of the word 'foolishness' is an ironic reference to the apostle's enforced self-vindication and boasting
The Judaizers throughout the generations and the centuries have sought to protect their religion and to hold on to traditional doctrine
Those who oppose the Lord's recovery often say something like this: 'Do you think that everyone and everything is wrong except you?
Sometimes your theological and doctrinal mind may be troubled and raise questions about the Trinity or about Christ being the Spirit
After reading a portion of a life-study message, you once again begin to feel that as the Bridegroom the Lord Jesus is lovely and precious
The Judaizers stir up questions, but the genuine ministry stirs up our love for the Lord Jesus as our Bridegroom
We need to see from 11:2 that we have been betrothed to one husband in order to be presented as a pure virgin to Christ
We have seen that in chapter eleven Paul has some strong things to say concerning the Judaizers, the false apostles
Here Paul seems to be saying, 'Dear Corinthians, my concern is that you would keep your singleness and purity toward Christ
As long as we have been brought as a pure virgin to this Husband and love Him, appreciate Him, and belong to Him, we shall be preserved
The serpent distracted Eve from the tree of life by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil with its complications
When we have the enjoyment of God, there is no separation between us and God, we are in life, and life operates in us
In distracting the believers from the tree of life, Satan seeks to separate us from the enjoyment of God as our life
For centuries the subtle serpent has been using teachings to keep God's chosen people from enjoying Him as their life
Today, by the Lord's mercy, we can realize that Paul certainly was the foremost apostle and was on the highest level of ministry
Do you not realize that our situation today is the same in principle as that in which Paul the Judaizers and the Corinthians were involved
Do you have the assurance that you can discern between their Jesus and the real Jesus, the Jesus preached by Paul?
If anyone's preaching cuts us off from the enjoyment of the Lord, that preaching must be of the serpent, of Satan
Any kind of teaching that causes your enjoyment of the Lord to cease is something of death, no matter how good that teaching seems to be
As long as someone's teaching or preaching deprives us of the enjoyment of the Lord as our life supply, that teaching is of the serpent
Whenever you hear them speak or read their books, keep in mind this principle of discerning according to life and death
Anything that causes your enjoyment of the Lord to increase is of the Spirit and of the New Testament ministry
In verse 3 Paul reveals his concern lest the Corinthian believers be deceived and lose their singleness and purity toward the Lord
If we pray-read all these verses and have fellowship concerning them, we shall receive more light and gain more life supply
In the foregoing chapters Paul was wise, but here he appears to be foolish, boasting and using ironic expressions
Would you not say that Paul seems to be beside himself when he declares that he will speak something not according to the Lord?
A person who has the confidence that he is not beside himself will never boast in the way Paul did in 2 Corinthians 11
Paul seems to be saying, 'If you gladly bear all this, can you not bear with me, one who is foolish and beside himself'?
In verse 23 Paul speaks of being in labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, and in deaths often
Not including the shipwreck at Melita , Paul was shipwrecked three times, none of which is related in the Acts
Verse 27 continues: 'In labor and hardship, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness'
Hunger may refer to a situation in which there is no way to obtain food; involuntary fasting may refer to a situation of poverty
Paul refers to his sufferings and hardships, which made him appear weak, mean, and contemptible in the eyes of his adversaries
In ancient times as well as today, there was the concept that a person who is blessed of God should not have suffering
Paul seems to be saying to the Judaizers, 'If you were truly of God, God would allow you to suffer a great deal
They also have the concept that those who must endure suffering and hardship are not under the blessing of God
When He was crucified, the Jews mocked Him and said that if He were of God, God would deliver Him from the cross
God's way is seen in the genuine apostles, in the genuine ministers of the new covenant, not in the so-called super-apostles
In the words of Colossians 1:24, we are filling up what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His Body, the church
Paul's wise strategy is to defeat the arrogant Judaizers by showing that actually they do not have any vision or revelation
He had the knowledge not only of human life on earth, but also of the things in Paradise and even in the third heaven
Apart from the Lord Jesus, has there ever been a person besides Paul who has seen the things in the third heaven and in Paradise?
The Lord has revealed, unveiled, these things to the apostle, and he has received visions of these hidden things
In this section the apostle desires to boast of the new creation in Christ by boasting of his weaknesses in the flesh, the old creation
The first William Law did not know anything concerning the Spirit, although he had much knowledge of theology and tradition
What happened to Paul was beyond his ability to express, for not even he himself was altogether clear about it
In verse 2 Paul says, 'I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago , such a one was caught away to the third heaven'
The third heaven must refer to the heaven of the heavens, the highest heaven , where the Lord Jesus and God are today
Notice that verse 2 does not speak of Paul being caught up; it says that he was caught away to the third heaven
As we have pointed out, the clouds may be regarded as the first heaven and the sky beyond the clouds as the second
The third heaven, therefore, must be the heaven above the sky, in biblical terms, the heaven above the heavens
It indicates that what is mentioned in verses 3 and 4 is another matter in addition to what is mentioned in the preceding verse
Now verses 3 and 4 tell us something further, that the apostle was also caught away to another place, into Paradise
According to their understanding, when Paul was caught away to the third heaven, he was also caught away to Paradise
Anyone who would have a full view of the universe must know these three sections the third heaven the earth and the region under the earth
The danger is that after receiving this kind of transcendent revelation, Paul would be lifted up and become proud
Sufferings and trials are often the Lord's ordination for us, that we may experience Christ as grace and power
It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weakness
The Lord uplifted Paul to the third heaven, then He carried him away to Hades, and following that He allowed a thorn to come to him
As we have pointed out, the Lord's sufficient grace was supplied to Paul, and this grace became power tabernacling over him
As Paul considered the high visions and marvelous revelations, the thorn worked on him to keep him from being proud and lifted up
He had been dealt with by the Lord through the thorn in order to experience Him as grace and as power in a very practical way
Like the Judaizers, they have an old, traditional religion, a Bible in dead letters, and many rituals and regulations
In principle, they are the same as the Judaizers, even in the matter of preaching a Jesus who is not altogether genuine
What Paul was, what he did, and how he conducted himself are a pattern for all believers, not only a pattern for the leading ones
The New Testament reveals that all believers in Christ should, like Paul, live a life for the building up of the Body of Christ
We are not able to predict how far along the Lord will take our young people and how much He will use them in the future
They should have done something to commend Paul, for it was not fitting for him to be compelled to speak concerning himself
If a certain brother is the target of attack or opposition, he may not be able to say anything to defend himself
In verse 11 Paul was compelled to point out to the Corinthians that in nothing was he inferior to the super-apostles
It should not have been necessary for such a word to be uttered by him, since he was the target of the opposition
The expression 'the signs of the apostle' may sound strange to us, but it did not seem strange to the Corinthians
Regarding God's salvation and blessing, divine grace, and spiritual gifts, you are not inferior to any other church
They will not deal with certain matters, also because they are afraid that if they do so, the supply of money will be cut off
In verse 15 Paul says that he was willing to be spent, even if loving the believers more abundantly, he was loved the less
They said he was crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints
Although Paul did not burden the Corinthians, some of them were saying that he was crafty and took them with guile
They said that Paul would not come himself, but used Titus as a cover to indemnify himself while he hid behind the scene
Having been inwardly warned concerning the matter, Paul sent more than one person with Titus to collect the money
We learn from Paul's experience that even though the saints may be honest, Satan is nonetheless crouching among them
Paul's word in verses 16, 17, and 18 helps us to understand what some of the Corinthians had been saying concerning Paul and Titus
They were accusing Paul of deceiving them, cheating them, and taking advantage of them by sending Titus to collect money
As long as the relationship between the believers and the apostle had not been adjusted, the church would continue to be sick
We all must learn not to be greedy, but instead, to spend what we have for others, even to spend ourselves, our very being
Apparently in these chapters Paul is vindicating himself; actually, he is neither vindicating himself nor defending himself
In Christ' denotes the life by which the apostles speak; it refers to the means and substance of their speaking
In verse 20 Paul mentions strife, jealousy, angers, rivalries, backbitings, whisperings, puffings up, disorders
In verse 3 Paul continues, 'Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak unto you, but is powerful in you'
In verse 4 Paul says that the apostles are weak in Christ, but live together with Him by the power of God toward the believers
The apostles followed the pattern of Christ willing to be weak in the organic union with Him that they might live with Him a crucified life
For the accomplishment of redemption, Christ purposely became weak, so weak that He could be arrested and crucified
My understanding is that in coming to the Corinthians a third time, Paul is telling them that he would no longer be weak toward them
As long as a believer realizes that Jesus Christ is in him, he is qualified, approved, as a genuine member of Christ
The apostle earnestly hopes that they might recognize this and that they may have no further questions about him
For the Corinthians to do no evil is for them not to be involved with the eleven sinful things listed in these verses
It was not for the purpose that the apostles would be approved that Paul prayed for the Corinthians to do no evil
What the apostle expects is that the Corinthian believers may do good, not that the apostles may appear approved
For this reason, we must forget about defending ourselves and vindicating ourselves and care for the edification of the believers
Verse 9 says, 'For we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your perfecting'
In other words, according to Paul's actual ministry, here he is working to reconcile the distracted Corinthian believers back to God in full
In chapter twelve he tells us how he enjoys Christ to the uttermost as his sufficient grace as his power and as his overshadowing tabernacle
Paul has no intention of assuming his apostleship, exercising his apostolic authority, or vindicating his apostolic standing
When Paul uses the word apostle, he means one thing, but when Christians use this word today, they mean something else
Paul does not use this word with a connotation that an apostle is a powerful person authorized by Christ to control and overrule
Our understanding of these terms must be biblical, that is, according to the pure Word of God, not according to religious tradition
May we all be apostles not in the sense of being popes, but in the sense of being slaves who minister Christ to others
Be perfected, be encouraged, think the same thing, be at peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you'
In Greek it is the root of the word for perfecting in verse 9 and also the root for perfecting in Ephesians 4:12
It is to be brought back to the right position and restored to the right track so that we may be built up together with others in the Body
If we study the whole book of 2 Corinthians, we shall understand that in this Epistle encouragement is an important matter
Being encouraged means that we are first comforted, then made calm, and then satisfied, strengthened, and enabled
The Greek word translated 'attuned' in 1 Corinthians 1:10 is the same word that is translated 'mending' in Matthew 4:21
It means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together
They needed mending to join them perfectly together that they may be in harmony, having the same mind and the same opinion
Paul exhorted the Corinthians to be attuned in the same mind, that is, to think the same thing and not to have peculiar thoughts
The Corinthians were lacking in love and short of peace through being disturbed by the distracting teachings and confusing concepts
They need the love and peace of God to fill them that they may walk according to love and have peace with one another
When many Christians think of God, they think of Him as the powerful One, the mighty One, the One who performs miracles
We have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit-the full enjoyment of the Triune God
In the Old Testament we also have a threefold blessing the blessing pronounced by the Levitical priesthood at the end of Numbers chapter six
In 13:14 what we have is not only a blessing; we have God in His Triune Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
It is composed of two Greek words: hupo, a preposition that means under, and stasis, a word that means supports or stands forth
Certain ancient teachers of the Bible used the word hypostases to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Griffith Thomas has said that we should not press the word person too far, lest we have the doctrine of tritheism
Even if we use this term temporarily, we wish to make it emphatically clear that we have only one God, the unique God
The first divine title used in His divine revelation concerning His creation, Elohim in Hebrew, is plural in number
At the beginning of His ministry on earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit for reaching men and bringing them back to Him
John the Apostle also strengthens the revelation of the divine Trinity for the believers' participation in the processed Triune God
