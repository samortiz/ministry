   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The death of Rachel signifies the death of our natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first two pillars we set up are not for us to have a happy life they are for us to exist to build the house of God for the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Jacob had eleven sons, not one of them was a complete type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not one of them was the son of sorrow and the son of the right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Joseph was excellent, but prior to the birth of Benjamin, he was not a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In typology Joseph is the continuation of Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This implies that no matter how many spiritual experiences we have had, up to this point, not one of them is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We still need Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for Benjamin to be born, our natural choice, our "Rachel," must die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God used Rachel to bring forth Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But by His using her to bring forth Benjamin, He took her away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God will also use the "Rachel" we love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But through His using our "Rachel," He takes her away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you examine your experience, you will realize that God uses your choice, your desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But by using it, He takes it from you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rachel's death was not only a suffering to Jacob; it was also a suffering to Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 2:18 says, "A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not be comforted, because they were no more."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For many years I could not understand how Rachel, who had been buried for more than seventeen hundred years, could still be weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, this verse says that, even at the time of the birth of Christ, Rachel was still weeping over her children, all of whom were descendants of Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Benjamin truly was "the son of sorrow," and Rachel was right in giving him this name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Benjamin's birth not only took Rachel's life, but also the life of his descendants more than seventeen hundred years later.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Christ had been born in Bethlehem, Herod slew all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and younger Matt 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rachel was weeping over all her children, those who had been killed by Herod because of the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that Rachel suffered martyrdom for the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rachel's weeping could be heard at Rama.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rachel was buried on the way to Bethlehem, and Rama is just two hundred yards from Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, Rachel's grave was close to both Bethlehem and Rama.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This region was populated with the descendants of Benjamin, the son of Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After Rachel died and was buried, she still had to wait for more than seventeen hundred years to pass by.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not even losing her life for the birth of Benjamin was sufficient; she had to weep more than seventeen hundred years later for her descendants who were to suffer martyrdom for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rachel not only suffered at the time of her delivery; she even suffered more than seventeen hundred years later.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The purpose of her suffering was the bringing forth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Firstly Benjamin, the type of Christ, came, and secondly Christ, the real One, came.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unlike us, God is not bound by the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, we need not be concerned about the interval of more than seventeen hundred years between the death of Rachel and the birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jacob had set up a pillar at Gilead and a pillar at Bethel, but now he had to set up the third pillar on the way to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our Christian life we also must have the landmark of the third pillar at Rachel's grave, the place where our natural choice is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our love, our desire, and our choice will one day be brought to an end and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Upon the grave of our natural choice we must set up a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This pillar is a signboard of the death and burial of our natural choice, the desire of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some person, some thing, or some matter we love dearly will die and be buried, and a pillar will be set up upon the grave to testify that our choice has been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we shall journey on to Bethlehem, the place where Christ is born.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The pillar on the way to Bethlehem directs people to Christ.</S>
