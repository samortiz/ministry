<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H2><P>Question: How does one overcome in a situation in which he sees people's failures and his contact with people has become spoiled?</P><P>Answer: We must realize that to know others' failures does not help us. We are sent by the Lord only to minister Him to others with His light, life, grace, gospel, and salvation. We are not sent to know others' failures. This realization will help us. We must only care to minister something positive to people and avoid everything else. We should have no heart to know anything else. If the elders are like this, they will love everyone with the same love (Phil. 2:2).</P><P>Only the Lord Himself can know things about others without being negatively influenced by His knowledge. We cannot help but be influenced by knowing too much. Therefore, the best way is to avoid knowing too much. The less we know, the better. If we realize and keep this principle, our visit to any place and our fellowship with others will always be a profit, but if we touch others' mistakes, our fellowship will be profitless. We will lose the nature of the fellowship, and it will become gossip. Only the Lord's grace and mercy can help people, so we must always do our best to minister His love, grace, and mercy to them. This is effective. The church should be filled with love, grace, mercy, and lovingkindness through the ministering of Christ to others. In this way people will be helped.</P><P>When we are helping others to be recovered, we must remember that in nature and essence we are the same as they are. Otherwise, we will be caught by the enemy through our pride. We all are sinful, and sometimes the Lord will allow us to be tested to show us that we are the same as others.</P><P>Question: How can we resume fellowship with a brother who has a problem after we have ceased to contact him for a while?</P><P>Answer: To touch such a brother carelessly is wrong, and not to touch him is also wrong. We must simply take the time under the Lord's sovereignty to minister Christ to him. We do not know what the result of this ministering will be, but we must carry it out. We should not reject anyone but should always minister something of Christ, regardless of who or how he is.</P>
