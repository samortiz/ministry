After His creation He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, which gave man his spirit. Man's spirit is able to communicate with God. When God's breath of life came in contact with man's flesh, man became a living soul with his own personality, character, disposition, emotion, will, and volition.</p><p>However, God's purpose was not just to create such a man. After man was created, God placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the midst of the garden of Eden, and He charged Adam not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It was almost as if God was telling Adam that He had to eat the tree of life. But God did not force Adam to eat of the tree of life because He created man with a free will with a right to choose for himself. God's purpose was not fulfilled after the creation of Adam, because Adam did not have the life of God. If Adam had chosen the tree of life and eaten of its fruit, God's purpose would have been fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE<br />THROUGH CHRIST</h2><p>What is God's ultimate purpose? His ultimate purpose is to have many sons. What is a son? A son is not a chair; a chair is made by man. A son is not made, he is begotten. A son is not just something picked up from the street. Someone who is picked up from the street is not your son, because he has no life relationship with you. A son is one whom a person has begotten and who has a life relationship with that person. This is why the Gospel of John says that a man cannot enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and of the Spirit (John 3:5). If a man has not been born again and not received God's life, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. No lower forms of creatures can enter the kingdom of man, because they are too far apart from man; they do not have man's life. The distance between God and man is immeasurably greater than the distance between man and the lower creatures. As such, man cannot enter the kingdom of God if he does not have God's life. In order for man to enter God's kingdom and be a son of God, he must have the life of God.</p><p>The Lord Jesus was God's only begotten Son. Yet God is not satisfied with having only one Son; He wants to have many sons. This is why Christ is the only begotten Son as well as the firstborn Son. As the only begotten Son, He is unique, having no brothers. At the beginning of the Gospel of John, the Lord was the Word, the only begotten Son of God (1:18). But in Romans and Hebrews, He became God's firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6). For God to have a firstborn Son means that He has other sons. The Lord Jesus is the firstborn Son, and He has many brothers. God calls those who have His life His sons. Man will not call a lower form of animal his son no matter how good that animal is. The matter is not about good or evil, but about whether one is of the same species with the same life.</p><p>In order for man to become God's son, he has to receive Christ. In the garden of Eden, God wanted man to eat of the tree of life. Today He wants man to receive Christ as life. There is a difference between a tree and fruit. A tree cannot be eaten, whereas fruit can be eaten. The fruit is the embodiment of the tree; it is the tree, but in an edible form. The substance of the fruit comes from the tree, and it shares the same life with the tree. God is the tree of life, while Christ is the fruit. Christ comes from God and shares the same life with God. He is God in a receivable form. On the one hand, God gave Christ to us to accomplish redemption so that we no longer have to be sinners. On the other hand, He gave Christ to us in order to dispense His life into us and make us His sons for the fulfillment of His purpose.</p><p>Romans 8 mentions conformation to the image of God's Son (v. 29). This conformation is not one man's imitation of another, moving when the other moves and stopping when the other stops. Conformation implies passing through the same mold. The Lord is a mold; He molds everyone who has believed and received Him into the same image. In Vietnam men make rice cakes by grinding rice into paste and pressing it with a mold. As a consequence, all the rice cakes bear the same image. Christ is our mold, and we will all be conformed to the same image. This is why some people say that Christians are in a class of their own, that they are all the same. This is true because we share the same life and are being conformed to the same image.</p><p>God's purpose is to have many men who share the same image as His Son so that they become His many sons and eventually be with Him in His glory in eternity. But something happened&mdash;man sinned and fell. Sin entered the world through one man (Rom. 5:12). But the Lord came as the world's Savior. He died on behalf of man and solved the problem of sin. Man has been recovered back to the point of being in the garden of Eden. Now this man must still choose the tree of life and receive Christ as life before he can become the son of God.</p><p>In this conference we want to see how God accomplishes His purpose in man. Tonight's word is merely a foundation. Starting tomorrow, we will begin to build the house. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we can clearly see God's purpose and the way to reach His purpose.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 62</div><br></body></html>
