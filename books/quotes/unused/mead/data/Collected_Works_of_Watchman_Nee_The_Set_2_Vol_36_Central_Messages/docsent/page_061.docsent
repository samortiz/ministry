   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORGIVENESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this reason, God needs a way which would forgive us and still conform to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through God's grace He can forgive us, keep His own law, and execute it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's grace says that He has kept His law and, at the same time, saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The grace of salvation tells us that sinners are saved and that God is still righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has not only saved us; He has saved us righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God would not do one thing that would make a sinner criticize Him in his heart, while keeping silent in his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God does not want to save a person and then be criticized as being unrighteous for doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is always righteous in His works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He wants to save men in a most righteous way; He wants to save in a way that no one can criticize Him or say anything about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In saving men, God not only wants to show men that He is righteous; He wants to shut up the mouth of the devil as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God cannot save men in a way that the devil would consider as being wrong or unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God must save us in a way that both men and the devil have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, He has to save us in a way that even He Himself has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As human beings, our actions are blameless only when they are blameless before men as well as blameless before ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same is true with God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He must do it in a way that neither men nor the devil nor Himself has anything to say.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God must save us in a way that we consider right, the devil considers right, and He Himself considers right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not a hard thing for God to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the problem is that He has to save in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible shows us that God saves men to the extent that both the saved and the unsaved ones have nothing more to say, the devil has nothing more to say, and even God Himself has nothing more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Salvation is for God to save men according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we say that salvation is God's masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know further that God's grace is regulated by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can say that God's grace comes through the channel of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because man has sinned, he needs to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But those who have sinned should suffer the punishment of sin; God cannot easily forgive a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose a criminal is caught and sent to the court.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The judge cannot release him just because the criminal's mother is too old to care for herself or because he has a three-year-old son at home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the judge does this, even though he may be commended for his good heart, he is being unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is "doing good" in an unjust way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God wants to do good in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need God to forgive our sins, but He cannot do anything unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God must come up with a way that would allow us to receive the benefit and allow Him to maintain His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our God cannot do anything unrighteous; He cannot be unrighteous even in His salvation of men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must remember that God saves in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What then did He do?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He used the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to remember that if God were not righteous, the cross would become a redundant thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God could forgive men in a generous way, why would there be the need of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there were no righteousness, there would be no need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But God is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, there is a need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The cross says that God knows our sins and that we should be judged and punished for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God knows that in saving us, He has to satisfy the demand of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He uses the cross to satisfy the demand of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cross is the price that God paid for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Twenty years ago, a preacher was preaching the gospel to a group of female students.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He spoke on God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He told them that God loved men and desired to forgive and save men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet His salvation had to be carried out in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man had sinned, and those who sin must be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The cross is God's recompense to His law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only by the cross can God save us righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Most of the students did not understand what the preacher was talking about, so he tried to explain with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was a large vase on the podium, and the preacher asked the headmistress, "If anyone in the school broke something that belonged to the school, what would she have to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The headmistress said, "She would have to pay for the damage."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He asked, "This vase probably cost at least five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a student broke this vase, would the school demand that she pay a recompense?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She answered, "According to the school rule, she would have to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If she broke the vase and did not pay, others would not have to pay if they broke a window.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If that happened, the rule would become empty words, and it would be useless."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not only were the students responsible for keeping the rule, but the headmistress was responsible for implementing the rule also.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was the headmistress's responsibility to keep the students from damaging anything, and it was also the headmistress's responsibility to get a recompense every time something was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a student broke the vase, she had to recompense according to the rule.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the student could not afford to pay, what could the headmistress do?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The student could not afford to pay, yet foregoing the recompense would be unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the headmistress wanted to be merciful to her and forgive her, and also wanted to take care of justice and keep the school rule, the only thing she could do would be to take five dollars from her own pocket, give them to the student, and tell her, "You have broken the vase, and there must be recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Take this money for your repayment."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As far as justice was concerned, those who broke anything had to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the money was paid, the demand of the rule would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If out of her love, the headmistress was willing to spend her own money to make the recompense, this would be the expression of the headmistress's love.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God's righteousness requires that all those who have sinned be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are like a student who has broken the vase.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have sinned, but cannot afford to make a recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God cannot be unrighteous and cannot let us go easily.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, He prepared the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The cross is the right punishment for us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All those who come to God through the cross are saved righteously, in the same way that any student who acted according to the above principle would be forgiven justly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our God must save us, on the one hand, and maintain His righteousness, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, He gave us His Son and crucified Him on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have sinned and deserve punishment, but we have the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can show God the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Before God gave us the cross, we could say nothing if God punished us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But now that He has given us the cross, He has to forgive our sins and accept us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must remember that since there is the cross, salvation is a matter of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Without the cross, we cannot be saved, because God cannot be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>With the cross, God cannot help but save us, because our salvation becomes a matter of righteousness and perfect justice.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord Jesus has suffered the punishment that we ought to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, our sins are forgiven in a most righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God has not forgiven our sins easily; He forgave us according to a righteous procedure.</S>
