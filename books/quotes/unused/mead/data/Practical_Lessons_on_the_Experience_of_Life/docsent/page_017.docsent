   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-9; 2:27-28a; Acts 2:42 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people say that consecration is for the purpose of being used by God to do a work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To some extent this is a wrong understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we come back to the Scriptures, we will find that consecration is actually for life, not for work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We consecrate ourselves to the Lord not to work for Him but for Him to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To do something for the Lord is a matter of work, but to be wrought on by the Lord is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we mainly need is to be worked on by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not the workers but the workmanship in the hand of the Lord Eph 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the Lord to work on us requires our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not cooperate with Him, He cannot work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to put something in a bottle, there is no need to ask the bottle to cooperate, because the bottle has no life, no mind, no will, no emotion, and no desire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To put something in the bottle is an easy, one-sided matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To give medicine to a child, however, is to put something into a living "bottle."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is hard to do because it requires the child's cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a child is not willing to cooperate, the parent may need to open his mouth and force the medicine into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has many things to put into us and many things to remove, but this requires our cooperation, which is our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I accept what You accept and refuse what You refuse."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The human concept is that the Lord is waiting to use us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we are not wrought on by the Lord, we cannot be used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Work comes out of life; it is the outflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How much we can be used by the Lord in His hands depends on how much we have been wrought upon by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His work through us and on us depends on our cooperation, that is, our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We always have to consecrate ourselves to the Lord for His work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not have the concept that we consecrate ourselves because the Lord needs us to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not tools in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we are vessels to contain Him Rom 9:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the negative side, many things need to be taken out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been filled up with many things other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the positive side, however, many things of the Lord all the riches of Christ must be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand we are dirty, while on the other hand we are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need the Lord's work to clean us out and remove the many things other than Christ, and we need Him to put Christ into us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the work of the Lord upon us, which always requires our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we said in the last chapter, after we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we must try never to defeat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Always be willing to be defeated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are persons consecrating ourselves to the Lord, there will often be a struggle between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because the Lord wants to take some things out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we say, "Lord, don't take it," there will be a struggle, but in this struggle we must learn never to defeat the Lord but rather to be defeated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Lord will have the opportunity to work something into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This requires our genuine consecration, which is for life, not for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After I have spoken here about consecration, I will not continue by speaking about how to work for the Lord and be used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, my intention is to speak about life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consecration is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider the type of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After passing the altar, we come to the laver, and after the laver we come into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we understand the correct meaning of the types, we can see that there is not much work here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, there is much enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that after our consecration, our main need is not to work for the Lord but to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be worked on by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To work for the Lord is not even secondary; it may be the eleventh item of importance, because there may be ten other things the Lord needs to do in us before He uses us to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to leave the thought of working for the Lord and pay our full attention to life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord told us to do almost nothing but believe in Him, love Him, and abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our work is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a not a work apart from life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fruit-bearing is the out-working of life.</S>
