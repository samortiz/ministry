<p>The Old Testament says that the city of David was David&rsquo;s stronghold (1 Chron. 11:5, 7). Therefore, when Nehemiah went forth to recover the city, the enemies appeared (Neh. 4:7-8), and those who built the wall did the work with one hand and held a weapon with the other (v. 17). This type is clear. It means that those who build the church must build and fight at the same time. Authority is a protection to the church. We must fight for this authority. In order to fight for the authority of the church, we must learn the lesson. When we lead the brothers and sisters to love the Lord and live for Him, thereby enabling them to obtain God&rsquo;s presence, we will not encounter much warfare. However, as we lead the church to have a proper order and enter into God&rsquo;s authority, the enemy will come.</p>
<p>The book of Nehemiah shows that the first stratagem of the enemy is not a frontal assault. He attacks from the side. Those involved in the building work need to learn to fight in spiritual warfare. We first need to know how to deal with the enemy&rsquo;s stratagems. Paul says that we need to stand against the stratagems of the devil (Eph. 6:11). We are not ignorant of his schemes. Whenever we build up the order in the church, Satan will use skillful ways to destroy our work. He will make a good proposal through a dear brother or sister. If we accept such a proposal, the entire building will be destroyed. The enemy&rsquo;s stratagems are often seen in the church. He is doing an exceedingly treacherous work. He is doing a work to damage the order in the church, to tear down the wall of the city.</p>
<p>In spiritual warfare it is more crucial to understand the enemy&rsquo;s stratagems than it is to pick up a sword to deal with the enemy. This is what Nehemiah did. Nehemiah first understood the stratagems of the enemy. When the enemies said, &ldquo;Come,...and let us take counsel together,&rdquo; Nehemiah&rsquo;s reply was, &ldquo;None of these things that you are saying have happened; rather you have invented them in your own heart&rdquo; (Neh. 6:1-9). Nehemiah saw through the enemies&rsquo; stratagems. Therefore, in the building work we need to know persons, matters, and the schemes of the enemy. Our knowing the schemes of the enemy depends on our knowing persons and matters. If we do not know persons and matters, the enemy can hide in them. If Nehemiah had accepted the enemies&rsquo; suggestions, he would have fallen victim to the enemies&rsquo; stratagems. If we do not know a matter, we will not know the enemy&rsquo;s stratagems, and it will be easy for us to fall victim to his devices. The enemy desires to destroy God&rsquo;s authority, the order, in the church.</p>
<p>For example, there was once the problem of whether the cup for the Lord&rsquo;s table should be a large cup or small individual cups. This problem is actually a matter of authority, not of the size of the cup. In principle, the elders in our district or local church should have the administrative authority to determine what size the cup should be. The administrative authority for this problem is with the elders, not the ones responsible for a group meeting. This is not a small matter. It is a very important principle. If we would build up and administrate the church, the determination of the size of the cup is not related to the truth but to the elders&rsquo; decision. We should obey the representative authority of the elders.</p>
<p>Even if a local church uses a large cup, but a district wants to use small cups, the decision still depends on the elders. It is an administrative matter. There is no need for discussions related to the size of the cup for the table meeting and what to use for the baptistery apart from the elders; such discussions can only cause chaos and lawlessness. This indicates a lack of knowing authority. In other words, there is no building in the matter of authority.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we may express our opinion any place other than the church. If we want to take the way of the Gentiles to practice democracy in the church, we will lose God&rsquo;s presence and protection. We must know God&rsquo;s building work, and we must know God&rsquo;s presence and authority. In matters relating to the church, those who serve the Lord should not talk freely. Expressing our opinions makes the church a debate club.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should not express our considerations; rather, it means that we should see the authority of God. A brother responsible for a group meeting should deal with problems according to the proper channel. He can fellowship with the elders and let them know his feeling. The problem should be brought to the elders. The elders should not hastily reject the feeling of the brother. Rather, they should bring the brother&rsquo;s feeling to the Lord and see how the Lord will lead them. This is proper. The responsible brother should then follow the decision of the elders without any opinion. The elders may feel to follow the feeling of the brother. They may also feel that the whole church should take the same way. This is a proper church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
