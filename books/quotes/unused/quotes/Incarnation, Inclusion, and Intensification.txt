As we will see, Christ's becoming the life-giving Spirit in resurrection involves something that we may designate by the word inclusion
Christ's becoming flesh through incarnation was rather simple, for it involved just two parties the Holy Spirit and a human virgin
In and through Christ's resurrection six things were compounded together to become the life-giving Spirit, which is God's anointing ointment
Calamus is a reed that grows in a marsh or muddy place, shooting upward toward the sky; thus calamus signifies Christ's resurrection
Five is composed of four plus one, with the number four signifying man as God's creature and the number one signifying God
From this we can see that the number five signifies God added to man to give us the ability to bear responsibility
Whereas the incarnation was an objective matter, this inclusion is subjective to us and applicable to us in our experience
Because the disciples were the representatives of the Body, we all were present when the Spirit was breathed into them
As a part of the Body, those disciples represented the Body in receiving the inclusion, in receiving the compound Spirit
The church should issue in the Body of Christ but regrettably as the Epistles reveal the church gradually became degraded even at Pauls time
Because of this degradation, the compound life-giving Spirit was intensified sevenfold to become the sevenfold intensified Spirit
From the foregoing we can see the history of Christ in three stages: incarnation, inclusion, and intensification
In the New Testament we have the fulfillment of the types and prophecies regarding Christ in the Old Testament
My study has been in three stages: the first stage in mainland China, the second stage in Taiwan, and the third stage in the United States
In a judicial sense, one who has been forgiven, washed, justified by God, reconciled to God, and sanctified unto God is a saved person
The Gospels end with a record regarding the resurrected Christ who has become the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit
In the evening of the day of His resurrection, this One came back to His disciples in an altogether mystical way
We cannot say that He appeared to them merely in a spiritual way, because He still had a body of flesh and bones
His appearing and disappearing at the end of the four Gospels is not merely spiritual; it is mystical, something that no one can explain
If He had been present only physically and not as the Spirit, His disciples could not have received Him as the holy pneuma, the holy breath
He was God with the element of divinity and He was a man with the elements of humanity, death, and resurrection
On the one hand, Christ's death dealt with all the negative things; on the other hand, His death released the divine life
The more we consider this, the more we will realize the complications involved in the Lord's all-inclusive death
Whereas it is common for Christians to teach concerning incarnation, very few, if any, teach concerning inclusion
In the first stage, the stage of Christ in the flesh, Christ produced a group of redeemed persons, such as Peter and all the other disciples
In this stage Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the compound, life-giving Spirit who produced the church on the day of Pentecost
The redeemed saints, who were produced by Christ in the flesh, became the church produced by Christ as the life-giving Spirit
Revelation is an Epistle, but it is very different in character from all the other Epistles in the New Testament
In this book Christ, who became the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit
In Revelation 1:4 the third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit, becomes the seven Spirits and is ranked as the second of the Divine Trinity
For the Body to be produced there is the need for the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to be intensified sevenfold
From their study of these chapters, they discovered that the church is in seven conditions, in seven stages, and in seven periods of time
The first stage incarnation is in the physical realm for the accomplishment of judicial redemption, which is a physical matter
Christ's history is divided into the section of His incarnation, the section of His inclusion, and the section of His intensification
In the stage of inclusion, many things are included in the pneumatic Christ, in the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
The Word, therefore, is actually God Himself, not God hidden, concealed, and mysterious but God defined, explained, and expressed
Before Christ's incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily
Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God
He was the Christ in the flesh, but through resurrection He was transfigured into the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and in verse 14, of the sons of God being led by the Spirit of God
In the New Testament phrases such as the love of God and the life of God mean that love and life are God Himself
The Spirit of Christ is the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the Jesus who lived a life of suffering on earth and of the Christ who is now in resurrection
The purpose of the Spirit's indwelling is to impart, to dispense, life, which is actually God Himself, into the three parts of our being
The Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
Not only has Christ become the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, but when He comes to us, He comes as the pneumatic Christ
Verses 15 and 16 indicate that the church as the house of God is also the manifestation of God in the flesh the mystery of godliness
In Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul speaks of 'the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
The divine life is a substance, the Triune God, and the organism of the Triune God is the visible expression of this substance
The Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence are all in the outward framework
These gifted persons have only one ministry, that is, to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church
We are building up something in this age the Body of Christ that is for something in the next age the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem will be the counterpart of Christ, the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God
On the one hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the glorified saints, as the dwelling place of God, is the tabernacle
The New Jerusalem, being both the tabernacle and the temple, is the mutual dwelling place of the Triune God and the glorified saints
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
Now we need to see something even higher that as God-men we have the divine right to participate in God's divinity
The spirit here is the regenerated spirit of the believers, which is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God
The more the mingled spirit penetrates our mind, saturates our mind, and possesses our mind, the more our mind becomes like God's mind
Our basis for saying this is Pauls word in 2 Corinthians 318 about our being transformed into the Lords image even as from the Lord Spirit
In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, indicating that these riches have been dispensed into us
In God's creation man was made in God's image in an outward way, but the image into which we are being transformed is something inward
To be metabolically transformed into the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ is to participate in God's image
Glorification is the step in God's complete salvation in which God will completely saturate our body with the glory of His life and nature
Another aspect of the God-men's divine right to participate in God's divinity is the right to participate in God's sonship
We can have God's life, God's nature, God's mind, God's being, God's image, and God's glory because we are God's sons
As a human son shares the glory or prestige of his human father, the sons of God share in the glory of their divine Father
Before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past, God predestinated us, marked us out, unto sonship
Romans 8:19 indicates that when God is manifested, revealed, we, the sons of God, will participate in that revelation, in that manifestation
God will be manifested with His sons, who will be the same as He in life, in nature, in mind, in being, in image, and in glory
We have received the Lord Jesus by believing into Him, and God has given us the authority, the right, to be God's children
Wherever we may be we need to remember that we are God-men with the divine right to participate in God's divinity
