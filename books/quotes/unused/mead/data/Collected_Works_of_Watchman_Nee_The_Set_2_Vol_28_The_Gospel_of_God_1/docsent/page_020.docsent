   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In verse 19 Paul gives us the reason: "It was added because of the transgressions."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to add something?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently I went to a certain place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During my stay there, I went with a few brothers to a restaurant for dinner one night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we do not have a home there, we went to a restaurant and ordered a meal of five dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These dishes were eaten very quickly, and so we asked the waiter to add one more dish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The addition of another dish was not our original intention; it was added to meet the immediate need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a similar way, Paul said that the law was added.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, God does not have to give us the law, and neither did He need to give it to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God gave the law to the Jews because He wanted to show the world through the Jews that He gave the law because of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why was the law added because of transgressions?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us look now at the last part of Romans 4:15: "But where there is no law, neither is there transgression."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And let us also look at Romans 5:20: "And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The purpose of the law is to cause the offense to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin entered the world through man, and therefore, sin is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Death came from sin and began to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the time of Adam to the time of Moses, sin was in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But how can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is evidenced by death being in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there were no sin from Adam until Moses, man would not have died.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fact that from Adam until Moses all died proves that sin was there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although there was sin during that time, there was no law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, there was only sin but no transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is transgression?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sin was real and present in the world, but man did not know that sin was here until the law of God came.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the law God showed us that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, there was sin already within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were corrupted already, but we did not know about it until the law came, at which time the sin within was manifested as transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law is like a thermometer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person may be sick with a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if you say to him, "Friend, your complexion does not look very good; you have a temperature," he may not believe you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All you would have to do is get a thermometer and put it in his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After two minutes you could show him definitely that he has a temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were already sinful; we already had a "temperature"; but we did not know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So God gave us a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the law may not be a perfect standard, it is a sufficiently high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God uses the law to measure us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By it we see that we have transgressed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we see that we have transgressed the law, we know that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin was within man already; but without transgressions, he would never have confessed that he had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was only after he transgressed that he would confess that he really had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I read the Bible, I marvel at the words the apostle used.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these verses he did not use the word sin; rather, he used the word transgression three times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sin is always within man, but until it is carried out, sin does not become transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There must be something to transgress before there can be the possibility of transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose there is a little child who always gets his clothes dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He always uses his sleeves to wipe his nose, and his clothes get dirty quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In his temperament, habit, thought, and conscience, he never considers that to dirty his clothes is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His father does not consider it a sin either.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The fact of sin is there even though there is no disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The child's clothes are very dirty, but he does not mind it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His conscience feels fine, because his father has never said that this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He can be unconcerned about it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even when his clothes are very dirty, he can still eat with his father, sit with his father, and walk with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything is fine as far as he is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, he has not transgressed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But one day his father tells him that he cannot get his clothes dirty anymore, and that if he does it again, he will spank him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the child has been doing this habitually, his father's speaking will manifest his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Originally there was sin only, no disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But once the child disobeys, there is transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the same way, only when there is the law will there be the transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the law tells you to do this or that, transgression will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Originally this child could come before his father uprightly and without fear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But now if he behaves according to his habit and does this again, he will have no peace within and his conscience will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the Bible readers and all those who understand God's will know that God did not give us the law with the intention that we keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The law was not meant for us to keep, but for us to break.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God gave us the law so that we would transgress against it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This may be the first time for many of you to hear such a word, and you may feel that it is strange.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has known all along that you have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God knows this; but you yourself do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore God has given you the law to transgress so that you will know about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God knows that you are no good, but you think that you are fine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, God has given the law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After you transgress against it once, twice, and a number of times, you will say that you have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Salvation will not come to you until then.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only when you admit that you do not have a way, that it is impossible for you to go on conducting yourself in such a way, will you be willing to receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only then will you be willing to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have already seen that in order to receive grace one needs to humble himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are sinners, and we have committed sins.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What causes us to humble ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Human beings are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All human beings think that they are strong and consider themselves to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But God gave us the law, and once we look at the law, we have to humble ourselves and confess that we are really not good at all.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is what Paul was talking about when he said that before he had read from the law that we should not covet, he did not know what it was to covet.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, once he saw the law, he realized that there was coveting within him Rom 7:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This does not mean that before Paul saw the law there was no coveting in him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There was coveting within him long before.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He had always coveted, but he did not realize that it was coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It was not until the law told him so that he realized it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Therefore, the law does not cause us to do anything that we have not done before; the law merely exposes what is in us already.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>That is why I say that God gave man the law not to keep it, but to break it.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Nor does the law afford man an opportunity to transgress; rather, the law shows man that he will transgress.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The law allows man to see what God has already seen.</S>
