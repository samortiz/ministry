<P>A number of saints in the churches have been baptized more than once. Some people have said this is wrong, that they should be baptized only once. Where does the Bible say that it is wrong to be baptized more than once? I cannot find such a verse. I am not advocating re-baptism, but I am fighting against legality. Many young members of the denominations gamble and do other evil things, but they receive little criticism. But when some young ones were captured by the Lord and felt that they were old and dead and wanted to bury themselves in the waters of baptism once again, they were criticized. Those who criticize do not care for life; they only care for their legality. In religion there is legality, but in the kingdom there is flexibility.</P><P>"Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?" (Matt. 17:24). How would you have answered if you had been Peter? We all must learn to answer this way: "He may pay the tribute or He may not pay." If we asked Paul whether we should observe the days or not, he would reply, "You may observe them or you may not." It makes no difference whether you keep the days or not, and it makes no difference whether you are baptized one time or three times. Do not be bothered by outward legality. The form of religion is maintained by legality. If you removed the legalities, religion would collapse because it has nothing of reality supporting it. All the support for religion is found in legalities.</P><P>Judaism was supported by three main legalities: circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and dietary regulations. If you were born into Judaism, you were circumcised on the eighth day. Then you were required to observe the Sabbath every seventh day and to follow the dietary regulations for your entire life. These three legalities were the pillars of Judaism. When the Lord Jesus appeared, He abolished the Sabbath regulations (Matt. 12:11). In Acts 10:9-15 the Holy Spirit abolished the dietary regulations, and in Galatians 5:2-6 the Apostle Paul abolished circumcision. If these three supports of Judaism were taken away, Judaism would collapse. In the same manner, Christianity utilizes many such legalities to support itself as a religion, but the Lord desires to abolish the legalities.</P><P>Look at the situation today. It is full of demons. We must exercise our faith and pray for others, sometimes with fasting, to cast out the demons and to rescue some of the possessed persons. As to ourselves, we should be flexible and have no legalities. I may cut my hair short, or I may let it grow long. I may have a beard, or I may shave. Either is right. I may shout, or I may be quiet. I may close my eyes to pray, or I may gaze into the heavens with my eyes wide open. Neither is wrong. I may say the words, "in the name of the Lord Jesus," or I may not say them, and yet still pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. We should have no legalities, but be very flexible.</P>
