<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN ETERNITY FUTURE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:1&mdash;22:5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN ETERNITY FUTURE BEING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ULTIMATE GOAL</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we have seen Christ in God&rsquo;s plan, in God&rsquo;s creation, in God&rsquo;s redemption, in the believers, in the church, in heaven, in God&rsquo;s administration, and in the kingdom. In this chapter we will consider Christ in eternity. This is the last aspect of the vision concerning Christ.</p>
<p>Eternity is not related to time. To those who live in time, there is a difference between the past, the present, and the future. But to God, there is no difference because He is outside of time and transcends time. In our view, however, there is eternity past, which was before the creation of all things. From our vantage point the Bible even refers to a time &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:20), that is, before the existence of the heavens and the earth. In our view eternity future will begin after the millennial kingdom, which is when the old heaven and old earth pass away and the new heaven and new earth appear. When we speak of Christ in eternity in this chapter, we are referring to Christ in eternity future. Christ in eternity future is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal. All of God&rsquo;s work, including His plan, creation, redemption, administration, and kingdom, is focused on the ultimate goal of expressing Christ in eternity future. In creation Christ is the sphere of God&rsquo;s plan. In redemption Christ is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan. In administration Christ brings in the kingdom through the church that is produced by His redemption. And in the kingdom Christ ushers in eternity future. Christ in eternity future is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In eternity past the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;held a council of the Godhead. This truth is implied in the Bible. The Father desired that the Son would be glorified; the Spirit was willing to carry this out, and the Son was willing to express the Father. Hence, among the three of the Godhead a decision, a plan, was made to create all things in order to express the glory of the Son so that the Father would be expressed in the Son and through the Spirit. If, instead of reading only the letters of the Bible, we would study it thoroughly to comprehend its meaning, we would see that this truth is implied in the Bible.</p>
<p>In eternity past, before the heavens, the earth, and all things, including man, were created, only the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;existed. Nevertheless, there was a desire within the Triune God for the Father to be expressed in the Son and through the Spirit so that the Son might be glorified. In order for this desire to be fulfilled, God entrusted it to mankind within the sphere of the created universe. The Triune God created the universe and mankind so that He might entrust His desire to mankind within the sphere of creation. Hence, in eternity the Triune God also desired to enter into man in order for man to have His life and bear His image and enter into His glory so that God&rsquo;s glory would be expressed in all things in the universe through man (Gen. 1:26; Eph. 1:4-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING<br />
FULLY ACCOMPLISHED IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal desire will be fully accomplished in eternity future. Creation was necessary for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal desire, but it did not accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal desire, because God had not entered into man, and man had not received God&rsquo;s life or entered into His glory. It was not until incarnation (John 1:14) that God&rsquo;s eternal desire began to be fulfilled directly among all things in the universe. Through incarnation God entered into humanity and was mingled with man. As a result, man in the person of Jesus Christ received God&rsquo;s life and nature and became one with Him. God is now working to repeat the story of His incarnation by entering into many people and being joined with them. This is based on His redemptive work. This work produces the new creation, which comes out of God and is in God. The new creation is the issue of God&rsquo;s redemptive work. Through redemption, He works Himself into redeemed humanity and thus transforms redeemed humanity into the new creation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemptive work will continue until the end of this age. It will be completed when the old heaven and old earth pass away and the new heaven and new earth are brought in. The old creation does not have God&rsquo;s life or element. But through God&rsquo;s redemptive work, the new creation is filled with His life and element. Our old man in the old creation does not have Christ&rsquo;s life and element, but by passing through Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, we become a new creation, possessing Christ&rsquo;s life and nature (Eph. 2:11-15; Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17). God&rsquo;s desire will be fully accomplished in eternity because all things will be made new.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
