   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY 1 Scripture Reading: John 20:1-31</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We come in this message to chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, a chapter concerned with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we know the contents of this Gospel in the way of life, we shall realize that chapter twenty is a chapter of multiplication, a chapter of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This multiplication for glorification was the goal of the Lord's life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE ETERNAL GOD BECOMING A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Gospel of John first reveals that Christ is God, the eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ's deity is eternal and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God, and He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, 1:2 emphasizes that He was in the beginning with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the eternal God, He is the One through whom everything came into being 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse reveals that the Word, the eternal God, became incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As this incarnate One, the Lord lived on earth among men for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His human living is recorded in the first seventeen chapters of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These chapters reveal the eternal God living a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever would imagine that God would become a man and live among men for thirty-three and a half years?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although this is beyond our imagining, the Gospel of John reveals that the very God, the eternal One and the Creator of the universe, became a real man with a body of flesh, blood, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The name of this man was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we read the Gospel of John, we see what wonderful things were done by Him and through Him as He lived as a man among men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though He was still the very God, He lived a genuine human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE DIVINE LIFE PASSING THROUGH DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapters eighteen and nineteen of John's Gospel are quite particular.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In these chapters the Lord certainly did not behave Himself as an ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, our understanding of these chapters may be natural.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we read John 18 and 19, we may sympathize with the Lord in a natural way and pity Him for all His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in these chapters we do not have a picture of a pitiful situation we have a portrait of a victorious Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, in our reading of these chapters we should not feel sad and sympathize with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, we need to see that these chapters are a record of the victory of Christ's resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 18 and 19 are an exhibition of the unbreakable resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In everything recorded in these chapters the Lord behaved Himself as the One who is the resurrection and the life 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This wonderful Person is life, and in these chapters this life is exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter nineteen this divine life passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Death did everything to Him that it was able to do, but it had no way to conquer Him or hold Him down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us review some of the details concerning how the Lord as the resurrection and the life behaved in the presence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After praying concerning His glorification, the Lord boldly went to the garden for the purpose of handing Himself over to death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He knew what would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He even encouraged Judas, the one who betrayed Him, to act more quickly 13:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord was ready to give Himself over to those who would put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of trying to escape, He went to the garden knowing that there He would be arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know what it means for the Lord to pray that the Father would glorify the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This prayer means that the Father should have the Son put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, when He prayed for His glorification, the Lord actually prayed concerning His death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After uttering this prayer, He boldly went to the garden to present Himself to those who would put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we read chapter eighteen, we should not feel sorry for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, we should realize that here we have a description of a victorious and glorious situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the events described in this chapter, life is exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have pointed out that the Lord's behavior in these chapters indicates that He was not at all afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, 18:4 says, "Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we see the expression of life, and life is not afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord was ready to be taken by them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His one request was that they would let His disciples go: "If therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away" 18:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even in the midst of that situation, the Lord cared for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord exhibited Himself as life both to His opposers and to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the human concept, the things that were happening to Him were extremely negative.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But He, as life, was not afraid of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What can death do to the One who is the resurrection and the life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>With this principle as the basis, we should read chapters eighteen and nineteen again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we shall see that every incident was an opportunity for life to be manifested and exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to these chapters, life was able to pass through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In chapter twenty we have the result of this process.</S>
