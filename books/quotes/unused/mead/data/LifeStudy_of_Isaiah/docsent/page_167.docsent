   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A VISION SEEN BY ISAIAH IN HIS DEPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The vision of Christ in glory was seen by Isaiah in his depression Isa 6:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah loved God and loved Israel, God's elect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He realized by looking at Israel's situation, that there was not the expression of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Israel had also violated God's holiness and had become corrupt in human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, King Uzziah had died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among the kings of Israel, he was a very good king, yet he died.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In that kind of environment, Isaiah was surely very depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord appeared to him in his depression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LORD, THE KING, JEHOVAH OF HOSTS,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>APPEARING TO ISAIAH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts, appeared to Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne Isa 6:1a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah saw the glory of God and the train of the Lord's robe filling the entire temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also saw the seraphim, and each seraphim had six wings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Two of the wings were for covering his face, two covered his feet, and with two he flew.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These seraphim called to each other, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is filled with His glory" v. 3 . That was their fellowship with each other, indicating that they signify or represent the holiness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were standing there for His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a vision should have encouraged the depressed prophet, but he did not tell us he was encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, he said, "Woe is me, for I am finished!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For I am a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell" v. 5 . Then one of the seraphim flew to Isaiah with an ember from the altar to touch his mouth for his cleansing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the picture presented in Isaiah 6.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Isaiah 6 Christ, the God-man, is seen in His divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This God-man is unveiled in chapter four as the Shoot of Jehovah, the Fruit of the earth, a canopy covering God's interests in the entire universe, and the tabernacle overshadowing God's elect to protect them from all kinds of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 6 shows us the same One in another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Isaiah 6 He is the God in glory sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because He is wearing a long robe, He is also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This One is the God-man with divine glory and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His human virtues are signified by the long train of His robe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the vision here pays more attention to Christ's human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The four Gospels show us Christ as God and as man, but they show us more concerning Christ as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Gospels we see more of Christ in His manhood and in His humanity than in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is expressed in His human virtues much more than in His divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, His human virtues need the divine glory as a source.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is a person with the divine glory expressed in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all have to see the full vision of Christ in Isaiah 6.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is sitting on a high and lofty throne as the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the very God on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John the apostle told us in John 12 that Isaiah saw Christ's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that Jehovah of hosts, the King, the Lord, was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ was wearing a long robe in this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that Christ's humanity is "long."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The train of Christ's robe fills the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord who appeared to Isaiah was on a high and lofty throne in His divine glory John 12:39-41 , signified by the smoke, and with His human virtues, signified by the train of His robe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His holiness is held by the seraphim Isa 6:2-3 .</S>
