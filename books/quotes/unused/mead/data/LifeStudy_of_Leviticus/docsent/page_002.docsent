   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Lev 1:1; 27:34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall give an introductory word to the Life-study of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. AN ADVANCEMENT OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we come to the book of Leviticus, we first need to have a general idea about the advancement of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All students of the Bible know that God's revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not reveal anything fully in just one book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we cannot see a complete view of God's revelation in one book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine revelation advances from one stage to another stage, from one level to another level, from one point to another point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when we reach the last chapter of the Bible do we have a complete view of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine revelation in the Bible advances continually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible was written over a period of more than fifteen hundred years, beginning at the time of Moses and ending at the time of the Apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within this long period of time, the divine revelation was completed, and the books of the Bible were eventually arranged in a meaningful sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In tracing the advancement of the divine revelation, we need to follow the sequence of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us now consider how the divine revelation advances in the first three books of the Bible in Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. In Genesis God's Creation and Man's Fall</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The book of Genesis reveals God's creation and man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Genesis, man fell step by step: from God to the conscience, from the conscience to human government, and from human government to rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this rebellion man forsook God and turned to the worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After man rebelled against God at Babel, God gave up the created race; however, He could not and did not forsake His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, after giving up the created race, God called out a new race, a selected race, beginning with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Abraham God promised that in him all the families of the earth would be blessed Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually the race selected and called by God fell from God's selection and calling into Egypt, that is, into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis we see that man fell from God to the conscience, from the conscience to human government, from human government to rebellion, and from rebellion to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today's world is the expression of man's fall to the uttermost, for the world is the ultimate expression of the steps of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first verse of Genesis says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth," and the last verse tells us that Joseph "was put in a coffin in Egypt" 50:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first verse we have God's creation, and in the last verse we have the issue of all the steps of man's fall a man put in a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the clear revelation in Genesis.</S>
