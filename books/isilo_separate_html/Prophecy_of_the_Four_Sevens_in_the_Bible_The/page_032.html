The Casting of the Unbelievers and<br>the Demons into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Finally, there is the casting of the unbelievers and the demons into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:12-15). God's judgment with all the plagues and calamities is used by Him to sweep, to clean, the dirtied universe. All the dirt, the unclean things, will go into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the "trash can" for the entire universe. After the unbelievers and demons are cast into the lake of fire, death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). Then the old heaven and old earth will pass away, and there will be a new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II.
