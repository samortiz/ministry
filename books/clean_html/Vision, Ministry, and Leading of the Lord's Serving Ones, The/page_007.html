<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH SUFFERING LOSS<br />
IF GIFTS ARE NOT TURNED INTO MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Although gifts are needed in the church, gifts can be a source of problems. The problems in the church in Corinth were related to gifts. For example, a church may truly be blessed when God raises up two brothers to speak. Initially, the two are quite fresh, and many saints are blessed, but soon the two can come to different views related to the truth. One may give a message on the need for a revelation to experience our co-crucifixion with the Lord, and his speaking may be clear and logical. The next week, however, the second brother may say that it is futile to merely see the matter of our co-crucifixion with the Lord but that we should instead follow the Holy Spirit daily and put to death the practices of our members. His speaking also seems clear and logical. In subsequent meetings the first brother may say that seeing our co-crucifixion with Christ is necessary because we cannot crucify ourselves, while the second brother says that it is possible to crucify ourselves because Colossians 3:5 says, &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth.&rdquo; Thus, the &ldquo;arguments&rdquo; of Job are repeated from the podium. After two years of such speaking, all the brothers and sisters will be hindered in their pursuit. Although the two brothers talked about our co-crucifixion with Christ, neither was willing to die, and although they talked about crucifixion, neither was crucified. There were messages about the cross but no crucifixion. They had the word of the cross in their mouths but not the life of the cross in their constitution.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly important for gift to become ministry. It is not a small thing when brothers and sisters love the Lord with their whole heart and desire to serve the Lord with their time and give up their future altogether. On the one hand, I treasure this and rejoice, but on the other hand, I am cautious. If we serve the Lord with gifts rather than ministry, it will not be long before the brothers and sisters all over Taiwan are quarrelling with one another. This is not a mere supposition; I know of many examples in our recent history and throughout church history. We have recently learned of a case in mainland China, and even the Brethren were divided over doctrinal disagreements among some of their gifted brothers.</p>
<p>Both George Whitefield and John Wesley received help from Count von Zinzendorf. According to the biography of George Whitefield, Wesley and Whitefield were co-workers, but eventually some problems developed. In regard to the matter of sanctification, Zinzendorf said that we have no holiness in ourselves and that we cannot be holy in ourselves; instead, our holiness is Christ. Whitefield agreed with this view. Wesley, however, said that holiness is a power within us that drives sins away so that we can be completely clean; therefore, holiness is sinless perfection. The two disagreed so much on this point that they could no longer work together.</p>
<p>If we do not see what it means for gifts to become ministry, our speaking eventually will produce only debates over doctrines. Doctrines produce debates, but a living stops all debate. The yes of a constituted living is yes, and the no of such a living is no. There is no need for debate. When the responsible brothers encounter those who want to debate like Job, there is no need for refutation. Instead, let them try to implement their suggestion. Their loss of the Lord&rsquo;s presence will eliminate all debate.</p>
<p>Gifts have a place in the beginning, but there is no benefit from relying upon them for a prolonged period of time. If gifts do not become ministry, they will damage the church. Gifts must result in ministry, or they will damage the church. If a man can only speak and work without constitution, the church may be helped initially, but eventually it will be damaged. If what we say and do are not a part of our living and constitution, our gifts will become a problem to the church.</p>
<p>I hope that all the gifted brothers and sisters will see that the church needs gifts, yet gifts cannot be relied upon for long. Gifts should be like silkworms that turn into pupas and then into moths. A gift needs to become a ministry quickly. If a gift does not turn into a ministry, it will help the church initially but later destroy the church.</p>
<p>I have had many co-workers from the day I started serving the Lord. Yet it is hard for anyone to find anything that I have spoken concerning the co-workers in a way of disapproval. When others have asked me if my view of the truth has been the same as all the other co-workers over the past twenty years, I must truthfully say that we have not always had the same view on many things. Nevertheless, I do not argue. Something within me stops me when I want to talk about a differing point. This can be called the cross, the dealing of the Lord, or the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but it kills the debate within me so that I can go on with the co-workers. It is quite dangerous to work merely according to gift. It is easy to be mistaken without realizing it. Gifts are useful, but we should not rely upon them. Gifts can be used to an certain extent, but they should issue in ministry.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that this word may shine in us and cause the co-workers to treasure gifts but not live in them, to learn to live under the shadow of the cross, and to be disciplined by the Holy Spirit so that the message of the cross may be constituted into us and that our gifts may become ministry. Then we will render help to the church and not become a problem to the church, and we will build the church, not destroy the church.</p>
