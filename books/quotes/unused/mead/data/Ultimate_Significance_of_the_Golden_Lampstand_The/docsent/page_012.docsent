   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SEVEN BURNING LAMPS OF FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR GOD S MOVE Scripture Reading: Exo 25:37; 27:20-21; 30:7-8; Rev 4:5; 1:4; Psa 73:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have looked at a number of aspects of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen the Triune God, God s relationship with man, the Lamb s redemption, Christ as God s building material, and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we lack sufficient knowledge of these matters, we will never see the church clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would have a thorough understanding of the church, we have to realize that the church involves the Triune God, God s relationship with man, Christ s redemption, and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, everything is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The children of God throughout the ages have only had a one-sided and fragmented understanding concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They do not have the thorough light from God to see that the church is entirely a matter of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the past up until the present, the understanding of many Christians, theologians, and Bible teachers concerning the golden lampstand only goes as far as the revelation concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They only know that the golden lampstand is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not go a step further to Zechariah to see that the golden lampstand also refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither do they enter into Revelation to see that the final destination of the lampstand is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, the golden lampstand is a testimony of God in the universe which begins with Christ, passes through the Spirit, and reaches the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are quite a number of items involved which are also important: the Triune God, God s relationship with man indicated by the name Jehovah , Christ s redemption, and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these items are included in this testimony, and eventually, there is God Himself as all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is His own testimony, and God s testimony is just He Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should never forget this sequence: the golden lampstand, Jehovah, the Lamb, the stone, and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE SEVEN LAMPS OF THE LAMPSTAND BEING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE SEVEN LAMPS BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we want to see the seven lamps, which are a crucial item of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main emphasis of the golden lampstand is its shining, and the shining depends on the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This matter is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we only look at Exodus 25, we cannot see much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can only see the record of a golden lampstand upon which are seven shining lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Its stem is in the center with six branches coming out of its two sides, three on each side, and the branches on the two sides shine toward each other.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 1:4 says, From Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s throne is present at the very beginning of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the universe, God has a center of administration, which is His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 4:5 says that lightnings and voices and thunders come forth out of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lightnings, voices, and thunders are a sign, a symbol, signifying that God is administering and moving from His throne to execute His eternal policy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The throne of God is the center of His administration, and upon His throne He executes His eternal policy and eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here, God has His move, administration, management, economy, and eternal operation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 5 also says that the seven Spirits of God are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The speaking in the Bible is very economical, and there are no wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven lamps on the golden lampstand are the seven lamps of fire before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This signifies that the seven lamps are absolutely related to God s administration, economy, and move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s move depends on these seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE TABERNACLE HAVING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE LIGHT ONLY OF THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must spend some time here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The lampstand was placed in the tabernacle, and in the tabernacle there was no door or window.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was no opening above or below, on the left or on the right, or at the front or at the back of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was one opening at the entrance to the tabernacle, but it was fully concealed by the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For anyone today to build a house without windows or doors would be a great folly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet, wonderfully, God built a dwelling place, the tabernacle, without windows or doors; only a curtain hung at the entrance as a veil, which hid the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, in the tabernacle it was dark, having neither sunlight nor moonlight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, in the Holy Place there was a golden lampstand, which had not only one lamp but seven lamps shining and illumining.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both the sunlight and the moonlight are natural light for us to observe natural things, such as mountains, rivers, flowers, grass, trees, and wild beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, natural light cannot help us to know God s administration, God s economy, and God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To know God s administration and economy, we must have the light of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we enter into the realm of God s presence, there is no light without the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Outside of the realm of God s presence, we have sunlight and moonlight, and we have the natural view, but we can never have the view of God s economy and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A university professor may have obtained three doctoral degrees and may have taught for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever science, literature, or philosophy are mentioned, his moon grows bigger and his sun radiates the light of his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, his light is sunlight and moonlight, that is, natural light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He can understand science, literature, and philosophy, but when he comes to the realm of God s presence, his eyes are darkened; he knows nothing whatsoever about God s administration and God s economy they are foreign to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In contrast, some of the young people have only been in the church for two or three years, yet they know God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, they know the divine economics.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>University professors only know the things within their field of research, but when they come into the realm of God s presence, their eyes are completely darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We, however, know God s economy, God s administration, and the dispensations in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not forget that in the realm of God s presence, the light is neither sunlight nor moonlight, but the light of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The light of the golden lampstand is the light of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though the tabernacle is small, the mercy seat within it is the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s throne is in the tabernacle, and before the throne are the seven bright burning lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we enter into the tabernacle, we cannot do anything without these seven bright lamps, because without them, we are not able to see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When a priest entered into the tabernacle, his actions were dependent upon the shining of these seven bright lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The light of the seven bright lamps dictated all the actions of the priests in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the way of God s administration, government, and economy.</S>
