   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Twenty-seven THE SALVATION OF ONE WHO OPPOSED THE LORD Scripture: Acts 9:1-19 One who served God zealously also opposed the Lord Saul, a young man serving God with zeal, was an orthodox religionist.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He was not only an orthodox Jew, but also an orthodox Jewish religionist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He received the orthodox teaching of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only was he not a Gentile, he was even a Jew who feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Though he served God with zeal, he, in his zeal, became one who opposed God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He then obtained letters authorizing him to bind those who called on the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand he zealously served God, on the other hand he opposed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fact that he could oppose Christ at the same time he was serving God with zeal shows that there is a difference between believing in Christ and being zealous for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not think that serving God is believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many serve God and are zealous for religion, but they offend the Lord more than those that love the world and live in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may be very zealous for religion, but your zealous activities are opposing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Elaborate fully on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is important to let people see that believing in Christ is entirely different from being zealous for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ met him When Saul was zealously serving God, that is, opposing Christ with zeal, unexpectedly, Christ met him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that there was such a man as Jesus, but he did not know that Jesus was the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to him all the preaching about Christ was false.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today there are also many who have some concept of Jesus but fail to realize that Jesus is God, Christ, and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today these people consider as false the preaching that Jesus Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the time he thought that the preaching about Christ was false and unbelievable, he met Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was obvious that he had met Christ, yet he still asked, Who art Thou, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord answered, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s salvation is not a doctrine, not mere hearsay, but a living Lord whose name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is God and He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every man can turn from opposing and not believing in Christ to believing in Christ as soon as he meets Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many have listened to preaching for years and yet have not met Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today men can oppose many doctrines, but they cannot oppose the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day the Lord will meet you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result of being met by the Lord You will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before, this man served God with zeal, but he had no light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once Christ meets you, then you have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some have been pastors for twenty years, or have been elders for eighteen years, but they are still in darkness, without any light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only pastors and elders may be in this kind of condition, but also many other religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You will fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You cannot get up again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You cannot go on the same way you went before.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way you acted as a pastor or an elder cannot continue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot go to the movies any more.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All your activities have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will become blind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The light is indeed bright, but you do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before, when you were a pastor or an elder, you had a way to handle everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now everything is unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever your concept about things becomes unclear, you know that Christ has met you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You will go into the city to wait for someone to teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What should be done after meeting Christ Repent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Believe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Serve Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The above four points must be expounded according to the record of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The result of this change You will preach Christ and testify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For Christ s sake you will suffer persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just as Saul persecuted others formerly, after he believed, he was then persecuted by others.</S>
