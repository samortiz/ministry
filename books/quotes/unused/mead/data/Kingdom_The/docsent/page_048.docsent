   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIFYING THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our relationship with the world also requires that we bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible tells us about a woman who loved the world very much Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus warned us concerning her, saying, "Remember Lot's wife" Luke 17:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lot's wife loved the worldly things in the city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although she was taken out of the city, she cherished the memories of the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She could not forget the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She looked back and became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus warned us to remember Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose there is a brother who, like Lot's wife, loves the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you pray for this brother, saying, "Lord, bind the strong man," it will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will work for a brother who has a strong mind full of opinions, but it will not work for a brother who loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A brother who loves the world needs to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To deal with our love of the world in our emotions is not a matter of binding the strong man, but of bearing the cross in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of the dear sisters find shopping to be so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although some people may not have money for shopping, they enjoy window shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They love the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we remain on the cross, we certainly will not go shopping that much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The soulish love of the world must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of love of the world in the soulish life is the satanic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is not crossed out, the Lord Jesus in our spirit will have no way to spread into our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the sisters love to shop, their emotions will be fully drawn away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many dear sisters have hardly grown one inch in the Lord because they love the worldly things so much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no room in their emotions for the Lord Jesus to come in; nearly every bit of ground in their emotions has been occupied by worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you can easily forget how many worldly possessions you have, that would indicate that you do not love them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, it is difficult for most sisters to forget the things that they have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every sister recalls these things very well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some sisters do not know how many chapters Matthew has, but they remember very well how many dresses they have.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may have been Christians for more than twenty years and yet be unable to tell exactly how many chapters there are in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is occupying your emotions?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where is your love?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the object of your love?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a matter of the kingdom of Satan or the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have used these practical illustrations because the Lord has shown us that the kingdom is not merely a dispensation or a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom is the totality of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It must be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>REMAIN ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of the verses in which the Lord Jesus speaks about the soul are related to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our soul must be dealt with in the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we love and where we put our love must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How we exercise love must be practically dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our soul has never been dealt with by the cross in the matter of love, regardless of what we may think, we are in the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although we are children of God in our spirit, we remain a part of the kingdom of Satan in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not simply a matter of being sinful or worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a matter of whether or not our soul has been dealt with by the cross in the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we love, our love must first be crossed out; if we hate, our hate must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to love and we need to hate, but our love and our hate must first be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the soul must be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has crossed out our soul already.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Galatians 2:20 declares, "I have been crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we have been crucified with Christ, we must remain on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must stay at the place where we have been already crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that we must bear the cross and never give any ground to the Satan-saturated soul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must keep our soul on the cross, especially in the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we want to love something or someone, we must love it by having our soul crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not a theory; this is the practice and practicality of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Occasionally, you may attempt to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may say, "I will look to the Lord and see how He leads.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I will do all my shopping according to the Lord's leading."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This sounds very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, regardless of how the Lord leads, you still go to the department store.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord gave you no leading, yet you bought many things, and these possessions are still at home condemning you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These things may not be sinful, but they are worldly; the Lord did not lead you to buy them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You bought them according to the love in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not simply a matter of being sinless or holy or free from the world; it is altogether a matter of being either in the kingdom of Satan or the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If your soul is continually upon the cross, whatever you love or hate will be in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Otherwise, both your love and hatred will be in the kingdom of Satan.</S>
