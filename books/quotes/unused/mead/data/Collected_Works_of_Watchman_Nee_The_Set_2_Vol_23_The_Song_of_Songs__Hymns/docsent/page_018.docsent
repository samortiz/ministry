   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the Lord purposely goes away and takes away man's feeling of His presence, it is difficult to recover it through man's ways of seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By now the maiden has learned at least one lesson: the Lord is not in the place of the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If she cannot find Him within, she has to look for Him without.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If it is true that prayer is not for prayer, that Bible reading is not for Bible reading, and that a quiet time is not for a quiet time but for His presence, then to a certain point, prayer, Bible reading, and quiet time have to be relinquished before we can find His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The maiden begins to leave her bed and to communicate with God's other children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She learns to take God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She no longer has coverings, and she does not care for her "face" any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She no longer tries to cover her inner emptiness with outward works.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She learns to mingle herself with God's other children and to solve her spiritual problems in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Formerly, the only way to solve her spiritual problems was with the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now she can walk through the city and search in the streets and the broad places.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although she has not met the Lord, He is inside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although she has not met the Lord along the paths she travels, these journeys are indispensable for her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soon she will meet the Lord; it is only a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 3 says, "The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words "go about" can be translated as "parade."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These watchmen are charged by God to watch over souls Heb 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They go about the city; they are the ones who are familiar with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps in the past, these ones rendered much help to the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the maiden has not sought them, their duty puts them in a place where they see the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The maiden thinks that perhaps these ones can tell her where her beloved is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the most that the watchmen can do is to show the way or the teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to meet the Lord, you have to go to the Lord yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No watchman can do this for you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Finding the watchman is not the same as finding the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every seeking heart must deal directly with the Lord and be dealt with directly by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the watchmen are useful, they sometimes turn out to be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord is dealing with you, you will not receive anything if you depend too much on others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to see that you have to leave the watchmen in order to find the way to the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may experience the same thing as this maiden, who meets her beloved as soon as she leaves him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Going about the city is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But we cannot find the Lord this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The broad places are necessary, but they will not lead us to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord wants her to take only one way, which the watchmen cannot help her to find.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 4 says, "It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now she finds the beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not mean that going about the city is absolutely justified, and it does not mean that the streets and the broad places are the right places to go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nor does it mean that she was perfected by confessing her failures before the watchmen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are still many lessons for her to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She is not only in the Lord's heart; she is also in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fact that she is able to find the Lord again is not a sign that she has been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It merely means that the Lord realizes that she can only take so much testing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although she is still far from perfection, her desperation for the Lord causes Him to gladly reveal Himself to her.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He brings this period of testing to a conclusion and waits before taking her on further in the way ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seeking of a person who is not in complete union with the Lord is mixed and imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord does not have the time to deal with this mixture now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the initial period of experience, the Lord is willing to allow those who seek to find, even though their seeking may not be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This experience is like that which is described in Ezekiel 47:3-5, where one is measured and brought through the water.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord has measured her, and He is now taking her through.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This portion of the journey has been under the Lord's measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"I held him, and would not let him go."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She thinks that she has regained what she lost.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She may think that she lost Him because she did not hold tight enough.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, she holds Him tight now.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once she was not alert enough in her feelings, and she allowed Him to slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now she has to be watchful to guard Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although she realizes that she needs to come out before she can be with the Lord, her heart's desire is still for His presence in her feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Part of the lesson of coming out has been learned, but the lesson of faith has not yet been learned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She has indeed risen, but she has not yet gone away with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She has not been brought to the point where she allows the Lord to come and go as He pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She does not realize that in a life of faith, it is impossible to retain the feeling of the Lord's presence forever.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She still holds on to this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She has not realized that the feeling of His presence should be allowed to come and go.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When He is pleased to give us the feeling of His presence, we can have it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But when He is not pleased to give us this feeling, we should gladly relinquish it, holding on to Him and on to all that He is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the maiden does not know this yet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She still thinks that the best experience is the feeling of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She is still not aware of even though she may have heard of it a way and a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, she holds Him tight and will not let Him go.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Little does she realize that holding with the flesh will only result in more loss.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A spiritual pursuit allows the Lord to have the full freedom in everything, whereas a soulish pursuit plans everything for oneself, even though he is seeking the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, the Lord deals with man according to his measure.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although there are still many lessons to learn and many things to know, the Lord is willing to be seen by the maiden, to be held by her, and to be taken away by her.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the present stage of dealing, she has passed through sufficient trials; her pursuit is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since she has not yet learned to separate the soul from the spirit, the Lord does not put any further burden on her.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"Until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although there is a mixture of the self, the Lord is willing to humble Himself and allow her to enjoy His presence once more.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord enters her mother's house and the inner chamber of the one who conceived her.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If "my mother's house" refers to the principle of grace, then "the chamber of her that conceived me" must refer to the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God deals with her according to the principle of grace and in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we were sinners, we were conceived in lusts and born in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The maiden is conceived in love and born in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>She now seeks after the Lord's presence according to His grace and love.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Poetically speaking, she is now bringing the Lord to an intimate place.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She is a maiden, and her mother's house and the chamber of the one who conceived her must be a most excellent place.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This concludes another section.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>She has a good enjoyment of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But this is not perfection yet.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord is still being pursued; He is still the passive One.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The maiden has not learned how to allow the Lord to have His freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But she has learned many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>She remains here for a period of time perhaps a few months .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A person finds the holding strength the strongest when he regains the Lord after losing Him for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Verse 5 says, "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord is giving a charge again.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Since she has suffered great testing, the Lord gives her a period of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He is saying, "This person is under My dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There is no need for others to help her or stir her up."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The lesson she learns here is real, and a period of real progress follows.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>From what follows, we can see that she has indeed experienced the power of resurrection, the riches of resurrection, and the life of the cross though not in an absolute way .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>She has learned these three lessons well.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, the Lord praises her with the words that follow.</S>
