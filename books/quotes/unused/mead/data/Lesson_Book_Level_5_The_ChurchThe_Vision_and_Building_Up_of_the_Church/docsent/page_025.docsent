   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Be Married at Christ's Coming Back</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 19:7 and 8 we see that Christ and His counterpart, His bride, will be married at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the bride will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words "His wife'' in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church Eph 5:24-25, 31-32 , the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, here consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Lamb, Christ needs a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Lamb who came to take away sin 1:29 and also the Bridegroom who came that He might have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's goal is not to remove sin; His goal is to have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the book of Revelation we see that Christ is the Lamb and the coming Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the Bridegroom, He must have a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to emphasize the marriage of Christ and His bride so that we may know that our position is that of the bride and the position of the coming Christ is that of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are on earth preparing to become the bride to meet Him, and He is on the throne in the third heaven prepared to come as the Bridegroom to meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, He is coming as the Bridegroom, and we are going as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we meet Him at His coming back, we shall have a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Revelation 19:7b says, "His wife has made herself ready.''</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this, building is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The overcomers are not only mature in life but are also built together as one bride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>C. To Be Consummated in the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 21:2 says, "And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the bride of Christ as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ and becomes His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 21:9b and 10 say, "Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whereas the bride is mainly for the wedding day, the wife is for the entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years as one day 2 Pet 3:8 and then the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The bride in the millennium will include only the overcoming saints, but the wife in the new heaven and new earth will include all the redeemed and regenerated sons of God Rev 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. To Be a Couple in Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation 22:17a says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.''</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse reveals that Christ and the church as His counterpart will be a couple in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God the Spirit and the transformed tripartite man the bride will be one and speak as one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible begins and ends with a marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible begins with the marriage of Adam and Eve in Genesis and ends with the marriage of the Spirit and the bride in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This final marriage is the marriage of the processed, consummated, and dispensed Triune God as the Husband with His regenerated and transformed people as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the transformed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the conclusion of the New Testament and also of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the conclusion of the Bible there is a couple the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God with the bride as the aggregate and consummation of the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here is an eternal, universal couple expressing the Triune God for eternity.</S>
