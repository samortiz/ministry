<P>When our mind becomes the spirit of our mind, the divine life will gradually spread from our spirit through our soul and eventually into our mortal body (Rom. 8:11). This is the genuine divine healing. The reality of divine healing is that our mortal body is saturated with the divine life from our spirit through our soul. Such an experience of the divine life spreading to our body can heal our body and prolong our life.</P><P>A careless person, one who behaves, acts, and conducts himself according to the flesh, may die an early death. In principle, no one who lives according to his fleshly lusts will live a long life. Most who live beyond seventy years of age refrain from indulging in the lusts of the flesh. To eat, drink, and live without any self-control is to commit a slow and gradual suicide. If we would learn to control our flesh by controlling our eating, drinking, and sleeping, we will live a longer life.</P><P>We not only control the fleshly lusts by exercising self-control, but we also call on the name of the Lord. Calling on the Lord's name also will prolong your life. Whenever you are about to be angry or unhappy with your spouse, the best way to deal with your anger or unhappiness is to call, "O Lord Jesus!" Whenever we call on the Lord, our anger and the damage that it causes to our health is stopped. Not only so, by calling on the name of the Lord, the Holy Spirit, as the embodiment of the divine life, spreads even into our body.</P><P>Although the divine life touches our body today, our body will still be a problem until it is redeemed. Therefore, we are waiting for the final redemption of our being, that is, the redemption of our body. This redemption of our body is the full sonship (Rom. 8:23). It will take place when the Spirit with the divine life which fully saturates our spirit, soul, and body soaks our entire being in God's divine life. This soaking is the blossoming of the divine life from within our body.</P><P>The glorification of our body is like the blossoming of a rose. When a flower blossoms, the bud cannot be seen any longer. The bud is transfigured into a blossoming flower. Today our body is troublesome to us, but one day our body will be glorified. Every day the sealing Spirit within us is saturating our body. He is saturating vertically, up and down, and He is permeating horizontally, back and forth. This is the process of our glorification. When the process of glorification reaches its climax, we will be fully mature, and this maturity will be our glorification.</P>
