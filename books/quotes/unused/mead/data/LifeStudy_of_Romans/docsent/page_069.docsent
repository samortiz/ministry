   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S PURPOSE IN SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the purpose of this dispositional sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose is that God may produce many sons Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 1:12 tells us that we have become the children of God, that we have been born as children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, let me ask you a question: do you believe that you actually look like a son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whose son do you look like?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although some Christians want to argue with me doctrinally, I prefer to inquire into what kind of person they are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, all real Christians have been born as children of God, but they need to grow into sanctification that they may look like the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So many genuine Christians, after being regenerated to be the children of God, continue to live in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They need to be sanctified in the divine life that they may grow into the maturity of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord has brought us into His recovery, and His recovery is for reality and practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May we look to the Lord for His mercy that He may rescue us from vain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we need is reality and practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the book of Romans what Paul wrote regards reality and practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has accomplished a great work that we might have His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now He is working within us that we may be sanctified, that His holy nature may be fully wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will not only be sanctified outwardly and objectively, but also inwardly and subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, we will be filled with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these messages I have no intention of giving merely another exposition of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What the Lord is doing among us today is to open our eyes that we may see our need for His sanctifying work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need His sanctifying life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need His eternal life to work His holy being into our nature that we might actually and practically be His sons, not in word, but in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we were born children of God, we do not resemble the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we need the subjective sanctification in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sanctification brings in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be transformed from one form into another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, not only the outward form must be changed, but the inward substance, the inward essence must also be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This change of inward substance requires the process of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that He is working in us!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been justified and now we are being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is working His holiness into us, and we shall be sanctified in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The crucified Christ was for our justification, and the resurrected Christ is for our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ died on the cross primarily for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ, as the Redeemer in the flesh, was for our justification, but now, as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, He lives within us for our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was the crucified One; now He is the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was our Redeemer in the flesh; now He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is our life and He is saturating our being with His holy nature until we are thoroughly, dispositionally sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason that in Romans, unlike other New Testament books, sanctification is not positional by the blood, but dispositional by life, even by the living Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord is working within our spirit, spreading Himself from the center of our being throughout every part of us until He reaches the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will be completely saturated with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, our whole being will be sanctified by Christ as the life-giving Spirit and by His fourfold life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that His life is fourfold: it is life in the Divine Spirit, in our human spirit, in our mind, and in our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, as the life-giving Spirit, He is sanctifying us with His rich life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is so rich!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is rich enough to supply even our mortal bodies with life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Justification is for sanctification, and sanctification is for glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the next message we shall consider the goal of God s glorification.</S>
