<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE PSALMIST SEEKING<br>TO EXPERIENCE GOD'S SALVATION<br>WHILE, UNDER THE OPPRESSION OF HIS ENEMY,<br>ASKING GOD TO DEAL WITH HIS ENEMY</H2><P>In Psalm 55 the psalmist seeks to experience God's salvation. At the same time, being under the oppression of his enemy, he asks God to deal with his enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist Seeking<br>to Experience God's Salvation</H2><P>Verses 1-2, 4-8, 16-18a, 22, and 23b show us that the psalmist is seeking to experience God's salvation. Verse 22, a "golden" verse, says, "Cast your burden upon Jehovah,/And He will support you;/He will never allow the righteous to be moved." This verse assures us that with God we are safe, for He, the supporting One, will not allow anything to move us. Do you have any kind of burden, and are you still bearing it by yourself? You need to cast your burden upon Jehovah, and He will support you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist,<br>under the Oppression of His Enemy,<br>Asking God to Deal with His Enemy<br>Based on the Principle of Good and Evil</H2><P>While under the oppression of his enemy, the psalmist asked God to deal with his enemy (vv. 3, 9-15, 18b-21, 23a). His request was based not on the principle of mercy and grace but rather on the principle of good and evil. His prayer regarding his enemy was based on the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Prophesying Concerning<br>Judas' Betraying of Christ</H2><P>Verse 13 prophesies concerning Judas' betraying of Christ (41:9; John 13:18). This indicates that in the pious expressions of the psalmist there was a prophecy concerning Christ on the negative side, considering Judas, who betrayed Christ, as His enemy. David was the type of the suffering Christ. In his pious expression of his complex sentiment concerning his suffering of his enemies, he uttered this prophecy here, indicating that Judas' betrayal of Christ was a part of the sufferings of Christ.</P>
