Although the term great wheel cannot be found in Isaiah, this book does in fact speak of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity
The book of Isaiah, in its content concerning God's eternal economy in Christ, is the leading book among all the books of the prophets
The vision, word, and burden in Isaiah are concerned with God's eternal economy in Christ, which is thoroughly covered in this book
The subject of the book of Isaiah is the salvation of Jehovah through the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and coming Christ
The first section, covering the first twelve chapters, is the salvation of Jehovah to His beloved people and to the nations
In the Old Testament Israel was God's chosen people, but most of the chosen ones in the New Testament are from the Gentiles
Gods dealing with Israel is like a fathers dealing with his children to correct them to improve them and to bring them onto the right track
In the book of Isaiah, God's love toward Israel is exercised in a threefold way, as a Father , as a nursing Mother , and as a Husband
Since God dealt with His beloved Israel in a loving way, His dealing with them was not a matter of judgment but of chastisement
Since they had become common, worldly, and completely unlike God in His holy nature, He came in to chastise them
According to Isaiah 1:3, Israel does not know Jehovah, not even as the ox knows his owner, and the donkey, his master's manger
Jerusalem stumbled and Judah fell because their speech and actions were against Jehovah, to rebel against the eyes of His glory
The elders and rulers of Jehovah's people consumed the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor was in their houses
They walked around with outstretched necks and lusting eyes, adorning themselves with luxurious and costly items
Some of the people joined house to house and laid field to field, leaving no place for others and dwelling alone in the midst of the land
They did not care for God's word; neither did they care for morality or ethics, calling good evil, and evil good
We need to be quiet and consider our own situation, not only our situation before we were saved but also our situation today
When Isaiah saw this vision he realized that he was still sinful that he had unclean lips and dwelt in the midst of a people of unclean lips
We may also be wrong with ourselves, for example by being angry in such a way that we damage our body, which is the Lord's holy temple
The more we are enlightened by the Lord, the more we will realize our situation, confess our sins, and ask the Lord to forgive us
As long as we are still living on earth in the old creation, we need to realize that we are sinful and confess our sins
Once a child has grown to adulthood, he may realize that what he thought was punishment was actually his father's love
There were only bruises, blows, and raw wounds, which had not been pressed out nor bound up nor softened with oil
Jehovah left the city of Zion like a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city
Unless Jehovah of hosts had left to them a surviving few, they would have been like Sodom and would have resembled Gomorrah
The Lord Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, eased Himself of His adversaries and avenged Himself of His enemies
God would also cause the strong man to become tow and his work a spark, and both the strong man and his work would burn together
Jehovah took away from Jerusalem and from Judah every kind of support all the support of bread and all the support of water
He also took away from them all the leaders, such as the judge, the prophet, and the elder, leaving them no rulers
The people were then oppressed each by the other, and no one was willing to be the leader, because of the shortage of bread and clothing
As part of His chastisement of His people, God took away from them all their leaders, leaving them with no rulers
Jehovah struck the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs exposed their secret parts and removed the beauty of their luxurious ornaments
Jehovah removed the hedge of Israel as His vineyard so that it would be consumed, and He broke down its wall so that it would be trampled
In His judgment over the nations, Jehovah of hosts is exalted, and the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness
To be righteous is to match God's way of doing things outwardly, but to be holy is to match God's nature inwardly
As the sons of God, we need to go on from righteousness to reach holiness, to show ourselves holy in righteousness
In spite of all this, Jehovah's anger was not turned away; rather, His hand was still stretched out to chastise them
According to 2:6, Jehovah abandoned His beloved people, the house of Jacob, because they were full of the customs from the east
His people had forsaken God's law and instructions given through Moses and picked up many customs from the nations, from the Gentiles
After Jehovah's chastisement on His beloved children, we have His loving exhortation and promise to His chastised people
Concerning the promise of forgiveness, Jehovah first extends an invitation: 'Come now and let us reason together'
Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool'
These two points which are much higher than the matters covered in the previous messages are related to Christ as the Godman and to Israel
As we will see, Jehovah's humiliating judgment ushers in the God-man, Christ, and issues in the restoration of the nation of Israel
Both the ushering in of Christ and the restoration of Israel come from Jehovah's righteous judgment on the nations
Finally, the millennium will consummate in the ultimate age of God's economy, that is, in the new heaven and new earth
If our understanding of Isaiah is limited to matters such as our sins becoming white as snow , our understanding will be too low
Because the nations were so haughty, it was necessary for Jehovah to humiliate them, to bring them down, through judgment
Isaiah was displeased with the nations, and he brought their case to the heavenly court and accused them before Jehovah
Their land was full of idols; they bowed down to the work of their hands, to that which their fingers had made
If we study history, we will see that throughout the ages God has judged those who are proud, lofty, and lifted up
The objects of Jehovah's judgment also include all the lofty and lifted-up cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks of Bashan
The purpose of Jehovah's humiliating judgment is, first, to show the dread of Jehovah and the splendor of His majesty
The purpose of Jehovah's humiliating judgment is also to vindicate the fact that Jehovah alone will be exalted
Eventually, as the result of Jehovah's judgment, in which His dread and majesty are shown, Jehovah alone will be exalted
As a further result of God's judgment, men will cast their idols of silver and idols of gold to the moles and to the bats
Men will do all these things in the attempt to hide from the dread of Jehovah and from the splendor of His majesty
The lesson of Jehovah's humiliating judgment is that we should stop regarding man 'whose life breath is in his nostrils'
God's judgment on the haughty nations ushers in the God-man, Christ , issuing in the restoration of the nation of Israel
According to 4:2, the ushering in of Christ will be 'in that day,' that is, in the day of the coming restoration of the nation of Israel
The Fruit of the earth denotes that Christ, as the divine Shoot of Jehovah, also becomes a man of flesh from the earth
As a man with the divine life, He is a seed, a grain of wheat, to produce many grains through His death and resurrection
In Isaiah 4:5 and 6 there are another two striking expressions, revealing to us more of Christ in His divinity and humanity
He who is left over in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been written down in Jerusalem for life
Isaiah speaks concerning the ushering in of Christ and the restoration of the nation of Israel in several different sections of his prophecy
They do not have a man to lead them, and they want to bear the name of a man so that their reproach might be taken away
As such a Shoot, He embodies the riches, the refreshing, the vigor, the growth, and the productive power of the divine life
Without Christ's humanity, it would have been impossible for the divine life to be productive in bringing forth fruit
The four Gospels show us that all the fruit born by Christ came out of the divine life, but it was produced in Christ's humanity
The Shoot of Jehovah denotes the divine life in its riches, and the Fruit of the earth denotes the fruit produced by this life in humanity
The New Testament reveals that, as those chosen and predestinated by God, we need to have the divine life expressed in our human living
If we have this, then in our experience we will have Christ both as the Shoot of Jehovah and as the Fruit of the earth
Christ is not only the Shoot and the Fruit He is also the canopy to cover us and to cover God's move and everything related to it
As we have pointed out, Christ is the centrality and the universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity
The Christ who is the centrality and universality of God's move is also the canopy to cover the totality of this move
Christ is not only the canopy to cover all the things in God's move but also a tabernacle to overshadow God's chosen people
We need to see this rich Christ and know Him as the Shoot of Jehovah, the Fruit of the earth, the canopy, and the tabernacle
Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years, but before now you had not seen Christ in these items of what He is to us
Had you ever seen that Christ, the God-man, is the Shoot of Jehovah in His divinity and the Fruit of the earth in His humanity?
Chapters six through eight plus chapters nine and eleven are a cluster of chapters in Isaiah's prophecy which unveil Christ to the uttermost
For this reason, in the first five chapters of his prophecy, he had very little to say that was good about the children of Israel
It was at this point that the Lord brought him into a vision so that he could see the Lord of glory sitting on the throne
In your disappointment with the church life, you may think that it would be better if you moved to another locality
John, in his account of Christ's living and working on earth, referred to Isaiah's vision here, saying that Isaiah saw Christ's glory
After Isaiah realized that he was unclean, he was purged by one of the seraphim, signifying the holiness of God
According to our enlightened conscience we are clean but according to the actual facts of our situation in the old creation we are not clean
The Lord said to him, 'Go and say to this people,/Hear indeed, but do not perceive;/And see indeed, but do not understand
Isaiah said that Rezin and Damascus of Aram, and the son of Remaliah and Samaria of Ephraim would be shattered
God sent the army from Assyria in the northeast to deal with the king of Aram and the king of Israel, who were threatening Ahaz
The Lord said that He would bring upon them 'the mighty and abundant waters of the Euphrates' , the king of Assyria and all his glory
If we are those who know the Bible, we should pray for the current Middle East situation in this way: 'Lord Jesus, You are Immanuel
According to Isaiah 6, Immanuel, full of the splendor of His human virtues, is in the heavens sitting on the throne
Immanuel is first our Savior, then our Redeemer, then our Life-giver, and then the all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit
On the one hand, this all-inclusive Spirit is the Shoot of Jehovah; on the other hand, He is the Fruit of the earth
The New Testament begins with the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son, whose name is called Immanuel, God with us
Satan's way is to use the nations the human beings created by God but not chosen by Him to frustrate God's eternal purpose
The fighting over this land is still taking place, for in the twentieth century the world situation has been centered in the Middle East
In the Old Testament, those who invaded the land of Immanuel were physical invaders, such as the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans
Toward the end of the New Testament, there is a revelation of this Babylon in its two aspects the religious aspect and the material aspect
We need to see clearly that the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son covers the Bible from Genesis 11 to Revelation 22
Todays Babylon has two sides the spiritual or religious side which is the Roman Church and the material side which will be the city of Rome
Eventually, this Christ becomes the center of an all-inclusive sign the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son
For us today, the sanctuary is the innermost part of the temple where we as God's priests worship God, serve God, and dwell with God
Those in this category included the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Herodians, the scribes, the elders, and certain of the priests
Many of those who opposed Christ were cunning and subtle, and in their subtlety they tried to trap or to snare the Lord Jesus
In Him we have God's presence, and God's presence is our dwelling, the place where we worship God and serve Him
The first group of Christs followers the beginning of Gods New Testament elect the one hundred twenty in Acts 1 and 2 were all from Galilee
Galilee of the nations was a despised place, but today we need to respect Galilee because it is the source of the church
Jesus is still visiting the 'Galileans'; He is still visiting 'Galilee,' the despised region, to gain the despised people
If those who occupy high positions in society would be saved, they must become those who are in the despised region of Galilee
Verse 4 continues For You break the yoke of their burden And the staff on their shoulderThe rod of their oppressorAs in the day of Midian
Without the birth of the human and divine child, there would have been no way for God to give His divine Son to us
As the human and divine child born and the divine Son given, Christ is the Wonderful Counselor, and He is also Wonderful and the Counselor
When the restoration comes, Christ will be the unique Governor, and the government of the Triune God will be upon His shoulders
Isaiah 10 shows that both the oppressed, the kingdom of Israel, and the oppressor, the kingdom of Assyria, were under the judgment of God
For this reason, it is correct now to speak not only of God's chastisement on Israel but also of His judgment on Israel
In their pride they said that they would build with something stronger than bricks and that they would replace the sycamores with cedars
Because of this the Lord would not rejoice in their young men and would not have compassion on their orphans and widows
Isaiah 10:3 says, 'And what will you do for the day of visitation/And for the devastation that comes from afar?
Assyria, overstretching beyond the limitation, did not think of the matter in this way, nor did their heart conceive it in this way
He would send leanness to the fat ones of the king of Assyria, and under his glory He would kindle a kindling, like the kindling of fire
The Light of Israel would become a fire, and His Holy One a flame; and it would burn and devour his thorns and his thistles in one day
He would chop away the forest thickets with an iron ax, and Lebanon would fall at the hands of the majestic One
In this message we will consider the restoration brought in through Christ and the salvation enjoyed by Jehovah's beloved people
Most students of Isaiah pay close attention to chapter eleven, which portrays a very pleasant picture of restoration
In the restoration, the coming Christ will be a twig that comes forth from the stem of Jesse and a branch from his roots
Christ as a twig came forth from the stem, the stump, above the earth, signifying that restoration is by life and of life
Verse 4b continues, 'And He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth,/And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked'
In the restoration this negative factor will be removed, causing a change not only in outward action but also in nature
The reason for this change is given in verse 9 the knowledge of God, that is, the knowing of God, will fill the earth
Verse 2 continues God is now my salvationI will trust and not dreadFor Jah Jehovah is my strength and song And He has become my salvation
God and the Lamb are on the throne, and the river of water of life, a symbol of the Spirit, proceeds out of the throne
Today we should not only speak of Christ and teach Christ we also need to drink of Christ as the life-giving Spirit
If we would enjoy Christ as the tree of life, as the element of life, we must drink Him as the water of life, as the essence of life
In our speaking, we need to tell the people that Christ's name has been exalted, that He has ascended and is now in the heavens
Of trusting in God, Israel expected to receive help from Cush and to gain something from Egypt for their boast
The calling to the prophet is from Seir, which is in the mountain range of Edom and which is the capital of Edom
The prophecy concerning Dumah in verse 12 means that it is the same in the day as in the night and nothing is happening
Isaiah 21:13-17 reveals that Jehovah would desolate Arabia by the harshness of battle because of its warlikeness
Cush, at the time of its flourishing, will bring a gift to Jehovah, unto Mount Zion, the place of the name of Jehovah
According to 19:19-25, Egypt will build an altar as a sign and a testimony to Jehovah in their land and a pillar near its border
Jehovah will bless Egypt Assyria and Israel saying Blessed be Egypt My people and Assyria the work of My hands and Israel My inheritance
Christ will sit in truth upon the throne established in lovingkindness in the tent of David to rule Moab in justice and righteousness
Jehovah will drive Him as a peg into a sure place, and He will become a throne of glory for His Father's house
They will hang upon Him all the glory of His Fathers house the offspring and the issue all the smallest vessels from the bowls to the jars
Verse 19, referring to Shebna, says, 'I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down'
The fact that Eliakim is a type of Christ is proved by Revelation 3:7, which applies the word in Isaiah 22:22 to Christ
Verse 23 says, 'I will drive him as a peg into a sure place,/And he will become a throne of glory for his father's house'
God's glory, all God's people, and all the different ways and means for us to partake of Christ and enjoy Christ are hanging upon this One
Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool'
The Bible of sixty-six books consummates in the New Jerusalem , and the New Jerusalem is the aggregate of Immanuel
We need to see that when God created us, He hired us, and that when He put us on the cross, crucifying us with Christ, He fired us
Although it is true that in the divine revelation concerning God's salvation Christ is our substitute, He is more than our substitute
Because Christ joined Himself to us, uniting Himself with us, when He died on the cross, we died with Him and were terminated
Regarding this matter the innerlife Christians use the term exchanged instead of replaced saying that Christs life is exchanged for our life
Because of man's reaction, God, who had hired everyone, eventually fired everyone that He might replace everyone with Christ
In Isaiah, everything is fired, discharged by God, and then the discharging God comes in to replace everything with Christ
On the one hand, we are fired, and on the other hand, we are not expelled; for Christ comes to live in us, with us, by us, and through us
The earth is polluted under the weight of its inhabitants for they have transgressed laws violated statutes and broken the eternal covenant
God may say that He will be the strength for us to love Him, but we may say that we do not know how to apply this strength
To Israel the nations were like leviathan the fleeing serpent and the crooked serpent and like the dragon in the sea
In 25:10b-12 we see that Moab will be threshed in his place by Jehovah, even as straw is threshed in the water of a dung heap
The lofty fortification of his walls Jehovah will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust
Isaiah 26:21 speaks of Jehovah coming forth from His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity
In this message we will see that this reaction issues in Israel's turn to Jehovah and their return to the Holy Land for restoration
As a pregnant woman draws near to giving birth, she writhes and cries out in her pain; so they have been before Jehovah
While the Lord is chastening us, we need to learn something of Him and find out the lesson that the Lord would give us
At times He has to be severe with us and chastise us that we may learn something of Him and perceive His majesty
In verses 12 and 13 Israel continues to pray saying O Jehovah You will ordain peace for usFor You have also performed all our works for us
O Jehovah our God, other lords besides You have been master to us,/But through You alone do we mention Your name'
Verses 15 and 16 go on to say Therefore in the east glorify JehovahEven the name of Jehovah the God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea
The expression the River in verse 12 refers to the Euphrates, and the grain denotes the scattered people of Israel
According to these verses, all the outcast, lost, and scattered Israelites will be gathered back to the good land
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: 'We have a strong city;/He will set up salvation as walls and a rampart
In the days to come Jacob will take root;/Israel will blossom and bud;/And they will fill the face of the earth with their produce'
Verse 7 continues by asking if Jehovah has stricken them like those who struck them, if they have been slain like those slain by Him
Awake and give a ringing shout you who dwell in dustFor your dew is like the dew of the dawnAnd the earth will bring forth the deceased
On this mountain He will swallow up/The covering that covers up all the peoples,/Even the veil that veils all the nations'
In chapter twenty-nine Jehovah's judgment on the hypocrisy of Jerusalem's worshippers issues in the restoration
In the entire universe, only the Divine Trinity is real, and the Divine Trinity has been embodied in a man named Jesus
When we have this reality, our eyes, our ears, and our understanding are opened, and we become very understanding and wise
The priest and the prophet stagger from liquor they are swallowed up with wine and they reel in their visions and totter in their judgments
Jehovah will arise and be agitated to do His deed, His strange deed, and to do His work, His most different work
Using different utensils, God dealt with Isaiah in one way, with Jeremiah in another way, and with Daniel in yet another way
In the day of restoration, Jehovah will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of His people
Jehovah will become a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment and strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate
In Acts 4:11 Peter says, 'This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone'
Later, in his first Epistle, Peter says, 'To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor'
Chapter twenty-nine reveals that Jehovah's judgment on the hypocrisy of the worshippers in Jerusalem issues in the restoration
The northern kingdom of Israel was full of drunkards, and the southern kingdom of Judah was full of hypocritical worshippers
What they received was merely the commandment of men, and what they practiced in their worship was altogether false
In Matthew 15, which is a fulfillment of Isaiah 29, the Lord Jesus dealt with the hypocritical Jewish worshippers
In Matthew 15:8 and 9 He quoted Isaiah 29:13 to indicate that the people were worshipping God in the way of falsehood
Jehovah has poured out upon them a spirit of deep sleep and has shut their eyes, the prophets; and their heads, the seers, He has covered
Verses 15 and 16 go on to say Woe to those who hide deeplyTheir counsel from JehovahAnd whose deeds are in the darkAnd who say Who sees us
In the restoration, Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered to be a forest
The afflicted will increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor of mankind will exult in the Holy One of Israel
He who terrorizes will cease to be, and the scorner will be consumed, and all who watch for iniquity will be cut off
If we are clean, clear, and full of understanding, we will realize that the situation among humankind today is of two aspects
God's people may become drunken by loving things other than the Lord, and they may be hypocritical in their praying and testifying
Whenever this kind of situation invades Gods elect He must come in to exercise His judgment upon the drunkards and upon hypocrisy in worship
God intends to restore the created and fallen things, but there is the need for Israel to usher in this restoration
No matter who we are and what our race, culture, or nationality may be, we all are utter failures as far as God is concerned
When we look at our failures, we are humbled, we realize that we have a need, and we repent, confessing that we are hopeless
Although this is not clearly written, it is nevertheless the basic and governing principle of Isaiah's writing
Isaiah 30:9 says, 'For this is a rebellious people,/False children,/Children who refuse to hear/The instruction of Jehovah'
Instruction indicates a teaching which is according to the law; it is the divine instruction given to God's people in the law
In verse 15 Jehovah the Holy One of Israel says In returning and rest you will be saved In quietness and in trust will be your strength
In 30:27 we are told that the name of Jehovah comes from a distance, burning with His anger and heavy with smoke
His breath, like an overflowing stream, reaches up to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of nothingness
Topheth, a valley of continual fire not far from Jerusalem where filthy and evil things were burned, is a symbol of the lake of fire
Jehovah will stretch out His hand, and he who helps will stumble, he who is helped will fall, and all of them will be consumed together
As we have seen, in 30:15 Jehovah says, 'In returning and rest you will be saved;/In quietness and in trust will be your strength'
For in that day each man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you as a sin'
Also, when they turn to the right or to the left, their ears will hear a word behind them, saying, 'This is the way, walk in it'
As our Teacher, Christ will no longer hide Himself in a corner, that is, at the crossroads, the place where we make a turn
According to verse 22, the people will defile the silver covering of their graven images and the gold plating of their molten idols
They will also have gladness of heart as when one marches to the flute to go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel
The divine revelation in Isaiah concerns God's economy, to have Christ as the centrality and universality of God's great move
The first portion includes chapters one through thirty-nine, and the second portion includes chapters forty through sixty-six
As descendants of Adam as those created by God we want to know God worship Him do His will please Him and fulfill the desire of His heart
We need to resign, give up, have a turn from trying to overcome our temper, and let Christ come in to be the temper- overcomer
Isaiah 33:1 says, 'Woe to you who destroy and were not destroyed, / And to him who deals unfaithfully and was not dealt with unfaithfully!
When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed; / And when you cease to deal unfaithfully, they will deal unfaithfully with you'
All their host will wither away, as the leaf withers from the vine, or like a sheaf withering from the fig tree
As for its nobles, there is no one there whom they may call to assume the kingdom, and all its princes will be nothing
God hired us to be kings, but we did not do very well; therefore, we were fired that Christ could be the King as our replacement
Concerning this, 32:1 says, 'Behold, a King will reign according to righteousness,/And the rulers will rule according to justice'
The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stammer will hasten to speak elegantly
The work of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever
In 332 Isaiah says O Jehovah be gracious to us we have waited for YouBe our arm every morningOur salvation also in the time of distress
According to 33:5, Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness
Verse 6 continues And there will be stability for your times A wealth of salvation wisdom and knowledgeThe fear of Jehovah is his treasure
There the Majestic, Jehovah, will be for Israel a place of rivers and broad streams, for He is their Judge, their Lawmaker, and their King
The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of Jehovah, the splendor of their God
The ransomed of Jehovah will return and will come to Zion with a ringing shout, and eternal joy will be upon their heads
At this point, everyone and everything has been fired by God, and Christ, the only one who is qualified, is here
Why, after covering these matters, does Isaiah spend four chapters to speak of a small part of the life of one person?
In chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine, Isaiah gives us an example in the person of Hezekiah, the king of Judah
Isaiah came to him and said, 'Thus says Jehovah, Put your house in order, for you are about to die and will not live'
God heard Hezekiah's prayer and answered it by healing him and saying, through Isaiah, that He would add fifteen years to his life
Since God was willing to heal Hezekiah, why did He not give him another thirty years and allow him to reach the age of seventy?
Had Hezekiah been permitted to live longer, he might have caused even more trouble to God's kingdom than he did in chapter thirty-nine
During his last fifteen years, Hezekiah made a mistake that was so serious that it caused God's kingdom on earth to be lost
He should have been careful, knowing that Babylon was Judah's enemy and that sooner or later the Babylonian army would come to destroy him
Some readers of Isaiah might think at first that Hezekiah was a person who was absolutely for God and not at all for himself
The kingdom of Judah was actually God's kingdom on earth, and Hezekiah should not have regarded it as his own kingdom
Hezekiah's response in verse 8 indicates that he had no thought for God and God's kingdom, nor did he care even for his own children
If we do not have the proper view of chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine, we may think that Hezekiah was quite good
He faced two great problems the invasion from Assyria and mortal illness and dealt with them in a way that seemed to be godly
In light of this pattern, we need to spend some time with the Lord and ask ourselves what kind of person we would be
In the foregoing message we saw, from chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine, what kind of person Hezekiah was
He was not careful and considerate but hasty, and instead of being for God and God's kingdom, he was for himself and his own interests
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them
Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand'?
When Hezekiah heard of the situation, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah
The king of Assyria heard the report about the king of Ethiopia which said, 'He has come to make war with you'
He went up to the house of Jehovah, spread the letter before Jehovah, and prayed to Him concerning the enemy's further attack
Verses 22 and 23 say, 'The virgin daughter of Zion/Has despised you and laughed at you;/The daughter of Jerusalem/Has shaken her head at you
Whom have you reproached and reviled;/Against whom have you lifted up your voice/And lifted up your eyes haughtily?
Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah according to His answer to him and won the victory in Jehovah's fulfillment of His answer
Isaiah the prophet came to him and said to him, 'Thus says Jehovah, Put your house in order, for you are about to die and will not live'
It is significant that in answering Hezekiah's prayer, the Lord referred to Himself as the 'God of your father David'
Isaiah 38:10-20 is the writing of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, when he was sick and had recovered from his sickness
Hezekiah's use of this word indicates that he had learned some lessons from the Assyrians' invasion and from his sufferings in his illness
He realized that he had been too hasty in the past and that his walk had not been so proper in the sight of God
At that time the king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered
When Hezekiah answered that they had come from Babylon, Isaiah went on to ask, 'What have they seen in your house'?
The fact that this word is spoken to the heart means that it is concerned not with the outer man but with the inner man
Those who receive Christ as this word of God will be regenerated that they may have eternal life to live forever
According to Isaiah 40:29-31, those who have received the word and have been regenerated are now waiting for Jehovah
Verse 31 says that such a waiting one will mount up with wings like eagles, signifying the resurrection power of Christ
Let us consider the difference between Hezekiah and Paul and ask ourselves whether we will be like Hezekiah or like Paul
With him, the old creation had been terminated, fired, and replaced, and now the new creation is here with Christ
Then the glory of Jehovah will be revealed, / And all flesh will see it together, /Because the mouth of Jehovah has spoken'
To the worldly people today, Christ is nothing, but to us into whom He has shined , He is the glory of God and the hope of glory within us
Isaiah 40 also reveals that all men are like a drop from a bucket and are accounted as specks of dust on the scales
The coming Christ is to be announced as Jehovah our God and as Jehovah of glory, to be revealed and seen by all flesh together
Now by touching the word as the embodiment of God, we receive for our regeneration a word that is living and abides forever
Those who stop themselves and wait on Jehovah will experience this resurrection power, be transformed, and soar in the heavens
Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was also typified by Israel for the carrying out of the kind word of comfort spoken by Jehovah to Israel
According to 41:21-29, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is for the exposing of the falsehood and vanity of the idols
Since we have been replaced by Christ, we must realize that we are nothing a drop from a bucket, specks of dust on the scales
As people who are withering grass and fading flowers , we need to learn to come to the Word of God so that we may touch God
When we receive the living and abiding word of God, we are regenerated, and we realize that we are part of the new creation
Isaiah 40:31 reveals that as we wait on Christ, we are renewed and strengthened to such an extent that we mount up with wings like eagles
They are not servants of Jehovah apart from Christ, but they are servants with Christ and in Christ in a corporate way
On the negative side, we are types of Christ for the purpose of exposing the falsehood and vanity of the idols
As types of Christ, we testify that we are nothing, that we have been fired and replaced with Christ, and that Christ is everything to us
A testament is a covenant, a signed agreement, that has become a will in which certain things are passed on to the heirs
Christ has not only given us the testament He Himself is the testament and the reality of everything contained in it
When we turn to the Lord and wait on Him, judgment comes, and we are able to act and speak in oneness with the Lord
He will not faint nor will He be discouraged Until He has established justice in the earth And the coastlands will wait for His instruction
Israel's being God's servant is related to God's desire in His economy to have a corporate expression of Himself for His glory
These three things are also types signifying Christs defeating Satan releasing us from captivity and building up the church as the temple
It is easy for us to realize that Cyrus was one with Christ as God's servant, but it is difficult for us to realize this regarding Israel
The captives were the people of Israel, the people who were to be used by God to express Him in a corporate way for His glorification
The servant of Jehovah is corporate, and Israel, having been released by Cyrus, was part of this corporate servant
For this reason, all God's elect can be considered servants of God with Christ for the expression of God's glory
In verse 14 we are told that for Israel's sake God sent to Babylon and 'will bring down all of them as fugitives'
In verses 18 through 21 Jehovah tells Israel not to call to mind the former things nor to consider the things of old
They have not brought Him a sheep for their burnt offerings, and they have not honored Him with their sacrifices
Jehovah also says to Jerusalem, 'She will be inhabited,' and to the cities of Judah, 'They will be built,' and 'I will raise up their ruins'
Jehovah says to Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd,' indicating that Cyrus is God's shepherd for the shepherding of Israel
Cyrus will do this by saying of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' and of the temple, 'Her foundations will be laid'
We who are one with Christ also have been fired by God, but unlike the unbelievers, we have been replaced with Christ to be one with Him
In these chapters Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by Cyrus to release Jehovah's captives of the beloved Israel from Babylon
They stoop and have bowed down together; / They are not able to escape the burden; / But they themselves have gone into captivity'
In verse 11 we are told that Jehovah is the One who calls for a bird of prey from the eastAnd from a distant land a man to be His counselor
Verse 4 says that Israel is obstinate, and verse 8 indicates that Jehovah knew that Israel would deal treacherously
In the fourth century Constantine the Great took advantage of the dissension that existed among the church leaders at that time, and in A
What was done by Constantine the Great opened the way for the formation of Romanism, which is a mingling of politics and religion
Romanism is therefore the product of the invasion of religion by politics and of the 'marriage' of religion to politics in a sinful way
590 the papal system was fully established, and Babylon was completely formed and consummated in both the political and religious aspects
In order to understand Isaiah 49, we need to see the three persons of the servant of Jehovah Christ , Isaiah the prophet , and Israel
In the New Testament, our oneness with Christ as servants of God is seen more clearly, because the New Testament says that we are in Christ
Since we are in this corporate Christ, and Christ is the Servant of God, we also are one servant of God, one witness of God
Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah , served Jehovah as His mouthpiece to speak forth His word, which is the embodiment of Himself
According to 49:2a, Jehovah made the prophet's mouth 'like a sharp sword' and also concealed him 'in the shadow of His hand'
From the womb Jehovah formed Him to be His Servant, to bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel would be gathered to Him
In verse 7 we have Jehovah's word to Christ as the despised One, the One abhorred by the nation, the One subjected to tyrants
If we have only the Bible but lack the experience of Christ as the reality, we do not have the feeling that Christ as the land is expanding
The more we experience Christ in this way, the more God's kingdom is established with God's temple as His testimony
When we returned to the Lord, immediately there were roads and highways, and we knew what to do and where to go
Finally, in verses 10 and 11 we are told how he who fears Jehovah and hears the voice of His servant has light while walking in darkness
Those who make light for themselves and walk in their self-made light instead of God's light will suffer torment
In 51:1 52:12 we see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in relation to Jehovah's loving dealing with His beloved Israel
Jehovah has comforted ZionHe has comforted all her waste placesAnd made her wilderness like EdenAnd her desert like the garden of Jehovah
My righteousness is near; My salvation has gone forth;/My arms will judge the peoples;/The coastlands will wait for Me'
In verses 7 and 8 Jehovah speaks a word to those who know righteousness, to a people in whose heart is His instruction
Because of Jehovah's arm, the ransomed of Israel will return and come to Zion with a ringing shout, and eternal joy will be upon their heads
They lift up their voice;/They give a ringing shout together;/For they will see with their very own eyes/When Jehovah restores Zion'
Jehovah has bared His holy arm /In the sight of all the nations,/And all the ends of the earth will see/The salvation of our God'
Verses 11 and 12 reveal that these chapters concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah are related to Israel's departure from Babylon
As God's adversary, Satan is always rejecting God, opposing God, and doing whatever he can to frustrate God from accomplishing His economy
In the Old Testament, Babylon was mainly political, but this political Babylon also interfered with the worship of God
The religious Babylon is revealed as 'Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth'
When its members believe its preaching, they are brought into the secrets, mysteries, and deep things of Satan to worship idols
Participating in Christmas may seem to be a small thing, but anything that is part of Babylon is abominable in the eyes of God
God commanded His Old Testament elect, Israel, to depart from Babylon and to separate themselves absolutely from Babylon
In Joshua 6 the children of Israel gained the victory over Jericho, but in fighting against Ai they were defeated
According to verse 14b, His appearance was marred more than that of any man, and His form more than that of the sons of men
Isaiah 53 is a sweet chapter that portrays Christ's dynamic redemption through His vicarious death and reproductive resurrection
He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him,/Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him'
In His divinity Christ has always been perfect and complete, and thus there was no need for Him to grow in His divinity
Verse 2 also tells us that, in His humanity, Christ had no attracting form nor majesty; He did not have a beautiful appearance
According to Keil and Delitzsch, Christ was a 'man whose chief distinction was, that His life was one of constant painful endurance'
Surely He has borne our sicknesses,/ And carried our sorrows;/Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,/Smitten of God and afflicted
We all like sheep have gone astray;/Each of us has turned to his own way,/ And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all/To fall on Him'
Sicknesses and sorrows are mentioned with transgressions and iniquities because our sicknesses and sorrows come from one thing sin
In Isaiah 53 we are told clearly that Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows in His vicarious death
Even those who were with the Lord Jesus when He was dying on the cross did not understand that He was dying for them
While Christ was on the cross, God was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief, in order to make Him an offering for sin
If God was pleased to put Him to death, and He was not willing to die, then His death would not have been a vicarious death
The vicarious death of Christ depends on God's being pleased to put Him to death and on Christ's being willing to die in such a way
If He had done any violence or if there had been deceit in His mouth, He would not have been sinless and He could not have died for us
Isaiah 53:11b continues, 'By His knowledge, the righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many,/And He will bear their iniquities'
After much consideration according to His infinite knowledge and His complete and perfect discernment, He justified us
We have a great many sins, but because Christ has decided to justify us, to accept us, He is willing to bear all our sins
Verse 15 says, 'Behold, they may fiercely attack you, but it is not of Me;/Whoever attacks you will fall because of you'
He declares, 'No weapon that is formed against you will prosper,/And every tongue that rises up to judge you, you will condemn
In that verse the Lord Jesus says He who believes in Me as the Scripture said out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
Everyone who thirsts come to the watersAnd you who have no moneyCome buy and eatYes come buy wine and milkWithout money and without price
Verses 2 and 3a continue: 'Why do you spend money for what is not bread,/And the result of your labor for what does not satisfy?
According to Paul's understanding in Acts 13:34 and 35 , the sure mercies shown to David are Christ Himself in resurrection
There was the need for mercy, which reaches farther than grace and which brings us into the position to receive grace
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,/So are My ways higher than your ways,/And My thoughts higher than your thoughts'
In 56:1-8 we have the matter of preserving justice and doing righteousness for prosperity and Jehovah's acceptance
Thus says Jehovah,/Preserve justice and do righteousness, /For My salvation is about to come/And My righteousness is about to be revealed
In the Old Testament, to keep the Sabbath was not to do any work but to remember what God had done in His creation
The more we realize that it is no longer we who live but that it is Christ who lives in us, the more we drink of the waters
The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have the taste for anything other than Him
They do many things, but they do not come to contact Him, to take Him, to receive Him, to taste Him, and to enjoy Him
Today, we may have a morning revival, come to the meetings, sing hymns, and even pray without contacting the Lord
Isaiah 57:1 and 2 indicate that it is better for the righteous and the godly to die that they may be separated from the wicked
Today we may care for such things as reading the Bible, singing hymns, and coming to the meetings but not care for touching the Lord
If we contact the Lord, have fellowship with Him, and remain in His presence, He will be happy and we will have peace
The wicked ones do many things, but they cannot have peace, because they do not contact the Lord, rest in Him, and remain in His presence
If we fast in the way of contacting the Lord, taking Him as our nourishment and sustaining power, our light will break forth like the dawn
Verse 9b is a word about removing the yoke from their midst, the pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness
Some may think that they are right and others are wrong, that they are spiritual and others are not serious with the Lord
As a result, these ones condemn others in the church life, and their condemnation becomes a yoke on others' shoulders
In verse 13 Jehovah instructs the house of Jacob to turn back their foot from the Sabbath, from doing what they please on His holy day
They were to call the Sabbath a delight and honor it, not doing their own ways, nor finding their own pleasure and speaking idle words
If they did not keep the Sabbath in this way, they would be those who do their own ways, find their own pleasure, and speak idle words
God wants us to learn one lesson to stop our doing and to keep away from the taste of anything other than Christ
To keep the Sabbath is to be 'fired' and replaced by Christ so that we may get into Him and rest in Him for eternity
To keep the Sabbath means that we stop our work, that we cease from our intentions, and that we are fired and replaced
Because people are busy working and eating, few have any room in their heart, any capacity in their being, for Christ
On the negative side, He is saving us from our sins and iniquities; on the positive side, He is our light and glory
Jacobs iniquities have become a separation between them and their God and their sins have hidden His face from them so that He does not hear
Whether we build up others or damage them, whether we minister life or death, depends on how and what we speak
Today the Christian life is just to practice the breathing of the Spirit and the eating and speaking of the word
As long as we have a proper dealing with the word and the Spirit we are one with the Triune God one with the Father the Son and the Spirit
Verses 15 through 18 reveal that in her restoration Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy for generations
Israel will have something brighter than the sun and the moon, for they will have Jehovah as an eternal light to them
By means of the life-giving Spirit and the word, which is the embodiment of Christ, we receive the divine dispensing
The more He dispenses Himself into us as life and everything to us, the more we become bright, beautiful, and glorious
He was anointed by God and with God, and then through His death and resurrection He became the ointment for the anointing of others
Eventually, the ministry of Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah, will issue in the restoration of Israel, His elect people
The history of Israel is mainly a history of tragedy, although there were times of glory, such as the building of the temple under Solomon
The temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, and the vessels for the service of God in the temple were carried away to Babylon
As a result, Israel will be called the terebinths of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, so that He may be glorified
In Isaiah's prophecy the Lord's two comings are like two mountain peaks which, when viewed from a distance, seem to be one peak
From this we can see the relationship between what Christ did in His first coming and what He will do in His second coming
When the second aspect of His coming is accomplished, His entire coming from God to mankind will be consummated
The first section took place two thousand years ago, and the second section will be accomplished in the future
In the Old Testament prophecies, Christ's coming was viewed as two mountain peaks which, from a distance, looked like one mountain range
In the restoration Israel will be priests of Jehovah, the ministers of their God, and the Gentiles will be the laborers to serve Israel
These verses indicate that Israel will exult in Jehovah her God with the enjoyment of His salvation and righteousness
In the restoration Zion will shine forth righteousness and will show forth salvation as God's crown of beauty and delight
Because during the restoration righteousness will be dispensed, transfused, into the Jews, they will shine forth righteousness
Salvation will come to the daughter of Zion, and the people will be called the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah
Before the tribulation, Antichrist will make a seven-year covenant of peace with Israel so that they may have their freedom
After three and a half years Antichrist will change his mind and will oppose every kind of religion including Judaism and Roman Catholicism
At the end of the last three and a half years, Antichrist will cause the armies of the nations to surround Jerusalem
With Jerusalem as the center, the entire region from Bozrah to the Mount of Megiddo will be occupied by armies
In His coming back, Christ will descend to Bozrah, and beginning there He will tread the winepress, destroying all the armies
At the end of the church age, during the last three and a half years of this age, Christ will continue His coming
According to Revelation 12 and 14, Christ will be in the heavens to receive the raptured overcomers into His presence
In the air, Christ will also have a wedding day, with Himself as the Bridegroom and the overcoming saints as the bride
Jehovah will bless Israel with the blessing of new wine and they will possess His mountain dwelling there eating drinking and rejoicing
In the restoration, an infant will not die before reaching maturity, and one who dies at the age of a hundred will be regarded as a youth
Verses 21 and 22 go on to say, 'They will build houses and inhabit them, / And they will plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof
They will not labor in vain Nor bear children unto turmoil For they are the seed of those blessed of Jehovah And their offspring with them
The expressions here are very similar to those in 11:6-9, which also speaks of the restoration brought in through Christ
Today we offer sinners to God as sacrifices but in the restoration the nations will bring the scattered Israelites as a meal offering to God
Just as in the ancient time, some will be appointed to serve as priests, and others will do the Levitical service
The book of Isaiah covers many things, including God's chastisement and judgment, but it consummates in the new heaven and new earth
After so many things have passed away, what will remain will be the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem
In the millennial kingdom the Jews will be priests on the earth, and the believers will be priests in the heavens
We need to thank the Lord, our Immanuel, that in these last days, He has opened up the depths of this book to us
6And there will be a tabernacle as a daytime shade from the heat and as a refuge and a cover from storm and rain
That plan is His eternal economy to create the universe and man so that He may have a people to express Him in a marvelous way
Christ as God came from eternity, but as man He came from the earth, so He is the Shoot of Jehovah and also the Fruit of the earth
The Shoot of Jehovah is a new development of Jehovah God for His increase and spreading through His incarnation
The shoot of this plant is a new development for Jehovah to be increased and to spread through His incarnation
Their God is merely in divinity without any element of humanity, but the God we Christians have is One who is in divinity and in humanity
The incarnated God, in His divinity, will be the beauty and glory of God's chosen people in the day of restoration
When a man lives Christ, people will consider that he is a weighty man, a man of gravity, a man of beauty and glory beyond description
When Mary came to Elizabeth, Elizabeth said to Mary, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb'!
Our own human excellence and splendor are very low but when we live Christ the human excellence and splendor which we live out are very high
We will fully realize that we have the divine beauty and glory of Jesus and the human excellence and splendor of Jesus
The second pair is in verses 5 and 6 where Christ is seen as a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace
Christ as a covering canopy of glory is the divine glory covering all the interests of Jehovah God in His holy mountain
When the day of restoration comes there will be over Mount Zion a cloud of smoke in the day and the brightness of a fiery flame in the night
God's glory as the cloud of smoke and the brightness of the fiery flame will remain on Mount Zion all the time
In the night His glory will be as the shining brightness of a fiery flame to keep God's people away from darkness
Our revised translation of Isaiah 4:5 conveys the proper spiritual meaning of Christ being a covering canopy of glory
According to our revised translation, over Mount Zion, over the temple, and over the holy convocations, the glory will be a canopy
He is presently overshadowing His believers in His grace as a daytime shade from the heat and as a refuge and a cover from storm and rain
The following four requirements are the conditions for God's chosen people to partake of Christ in the age of restoration
The filth should be washed away and the bloodstains should be cleansed away by the Lord with His judging and burning Spirit
The judging and burning Spirit should work within us to wash away our filth and to cleanse away our bloodstains
The age of grace is a foretaste of the age of restoration, and we are the people who can enjoy such a foretaste
Christ, as the one grain who fell into the earth to die, produced many grains, many believers, in resurrection
Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth will eventually become a canopy to cover all the interests of God on this earth
He is also the tabernacle overshadowing us, God's elect, protecting us from all kinds of troubles signified by heat, storm, and rain
The Lord seen by Isaiah must have been in the image of a man because verse 1 tells us that the train of His robe filled the temple
When Christ accomplished His redemption on the cross, He fulfilled the requirements of God's glory, God's holiness, and God's righteousness
As fallen sinners, we cannot fulfill the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness, but Christ satisfied them
We need to see the vision of Christ in Isaiah 6 in His glory, His holiness, and His righteousness with His human virtues
These seraphim called to each other, saying, 'Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is filled with His glory'
Christ is seen in Isaiah 6 as God in His divinity, signified by the smoke, and as a man in His humanity, signified by the train of His robe
Isaiah 5:16 says, 'Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment, and the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness'
Righteousness is the foundation of God's throne , and we are expecting new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
In the four Gospels, Jesus surely was a separated, unique, and particular person because He was righteous all the time
He was sent by the Lord to lead Israel to express Christ's divine glory in His human virtues held in His holiness
He desired that they would live righteousness, showing that they are a holy people, different and distinct from the nations
In this message we come to two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ, recorded in Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6
The word child in these verses implies God, implies man, implies God becoming a man, and implies God and man mingled together as one
The second revelation Isaiah saw concerning Christ was that of Christ in His divine glory with His human virtues held in His holiness
His divine glory is signified by the smoke His human virtues are signified by the train of His robe and His holiness is held by the seraphim
Isaiah was written about seven hundred years before Christ's incarnation, yet it speaks of a child born who would be the very God
The divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been generated in Mary's womb before she delivered the child Jesus
Isaiah 9:6 says that this One's name is to be called 'Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace'
Some translations separate the words Wonderful and Counselor with a comma, indicating that these are two separate titles
Because the other items in 9:6 are composed of a noun with a modifier, it is logical to say that 'Wonderful' should modify 'Counselor'
Isaiah 96 says The government is upon His shoulders and verse 7 says To the increase of His government and to His peace there is no end
In Luke 1 the angel Gabriel said to Mary that 'He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall not be an end'
Sometimes when we go to our wives or husbands to ask them something they will say that they do not have the time at that moment to answer us
If he would silently receive the cross and receive Christ as the Prince ruling over him, he would immediately have peace within
The tabernacle and the temple were not only the dwelling place of God but also the dwelling place of His serving ones, the priests
We have to realize that God is not only our Savior, Redeemer, Master, Lord, and life but also our dwelling place
Such a revelation of God as our sanctuary should cause us to aspire to live a life with God as our roommate all the time
When we enjoy Him as our dwelling place and as our roommate, we have light, air, water, food, and everything that we need
In the New Testament, we are made a part of this sanctuary, so in the Epistles we are told that we are God's temple
Christ with all the members of His Body will be consummated as the enlarged tabernacle and temple of God the New Jerusalem
In Revelation 21, John said that he did not see the temple in the New Jerusalem, because God and the Lamb are the temple
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and us for eternity
The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in
In Ephesians 3 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us into our inner man, so that Christ could make His home in our hearts
The Pharisees and the Jewish leaders struck against Christ as a stone , and the unbelieving ones stumbled at Christ as a rock
The Old Testament prophesied that He would be of the seed of David and that He would come out of the city of David, Bethlehem
His mother Mary was a descendant of Nathan, David's son , and Joseph was a descendant of Solomon, another of David's sons
Most of the people who are extremely wise, intelligent, powerful, and of the upper class do not care for Christ
God chose mostly the foolish, the weak, the lowborn, and the despised, so that no one would be able to boast before Him
He is a trap for the negative ones as the running animals and a snare for the negative ones as the flying fowls
Many may acknowledge that Jesus is their Lord, their Savior, and their Redeemer, yet they may be indifferent toward Him, not caring for Him
We can live in Him as our sanctuary, and in Him we can receive Him as our bountiful provision and all-inclusive supply
To the negative ones, however, the unbelieving ones, He is a stone to strike against, a rock of stumbling, a trap, and a snare
The only way that we can enjoy God in every way is to live in Him, taking Him as our sanctuary and living with Him as our roommate
He is also a sanctuary to the positive ones and a stone to strike against, a rock of stumbling, a trap, and a snare to the negative ones
As the sons of light, we should live in the light, walk in the light, remain in the light, and be persons altogether in the light
The people who walked in the darkness have seen a great light; upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death light has shined'
Gloom, anguish, and contempt were in the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali Galilee of the nations because darkness was there
Their gladness is like the gladness of those who have a harvest and like the gladness of those who divide the spoil after winning the battle
Verse 4 says For You break the yoke of their burden And the staff on their shoulder The rod of their oppressor As in the day of Midian
The king of Assyria came to invade Judah and to oppress them, but the Lord destroyed them as He destroyed the Midianites through Gideon
They are released from their bondage, from their imprisonment, and from the yoke, the staff, and the rod of their oppressor
If we went out today to visit people with the gospel, and three were baptized, this would be a harvest, making us full of joy and gladness
Through His shining, He breaks the yoke of our burden, the staff on our shoulder, and the rod of our oppressor
If two people are roommates, they are prone to arguing and disagreeing with each other and bothering each other
There may be only a 'narrow crack' in our being as an opening to Him, but He shines into us through that opening
We will be the proper harvesters and fighters for the multiplication of the people of God, and we will have joy, rejoicing, and gladness
There is also the breaking of the yoke of the burden of the people of God, of the staff on their shoulder, and of the rod of their oppressor
The first pair is Christ as a twig from the stem of Jesse and a branch from the roots of Jesse bringing in the restoration of life
The issue of Jesse, the house of David, had been hewn down, but the source from which David came still remained
The royal family of David the house of David was cut down when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to conquer Judah and subdue Israel
The royal family was cut down, leaving the stem with the roots there for approximately six centuries, from about 606 B
According to our thought, Christ has two comings, but according to God's realization, He has sent His Son once for all
Matthew 24:27 says, 'For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be'
The Lord's going through death and resurrection was actually His coming to the disciples as the Spirit to get into them and dwell in them
He was a little twig in the manger at Bethlehem, but as the lightning in Matthew 24:27, He will be a great standard to the nations
He is full of the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah
On the one hand, Christ as the twig and the branch is in the heavens, and on the other hand, He is within the believers and the church
The Spirit of counsel and might points to Jesus Himself as the Wonderful Counselor who gives us counsel all the time by the Spirit
From the time we were saved by the Lord, we have been receiving a spiritual education and acquiring spiritual knowledge
As the twig from the stem of Jesse and the branch from the roots of Jesse, Christ carries out the administration of Jehovah
When Christ returns, He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips, He will slay the wicked
In the restoration of life, the calf, the young lamb, and the fatling will be together, and a young boy will lead them about
The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, and upon the viper's den the weaned child will stretch his hand
Because the church life is a foretaste of the coming age all the wolves leopards bears lions and Svipers should have their nature changed
In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ in Isaiah 11
Isaiah 11 is altogether a chapter on the coming restoration of life, especially the restoration of the returned nation of Israel
The twig and the branch come up in life, and this life is full of restoring power, deepening power, growing power, and fruit-bearing power
In order to understand the biblical truths, we need to understand the proper meaning of the words used in the Bible
The banner is mainly for designation, explanation, and instruction, and the standard is mainly for calling and gathering
We need to see why Isaiah couples Christ as the twig and the branch with Christ as the banner and the standard
A banner, probably being the enlargement of the twig in verse 1, indicates an ensign as a gathering and collecting mark
Him will the nations seek indicates that all the nations of the earth will turn to Him and be willing to be His people
The day will come when all the peoples on this earth will turn to seek after Christ and will be happy to be His people
A standard, probably being the enlargement of the branch in verse 1, indicates the influence of the calling and gathering power
The Lord will recover for the second time the remnant of His people from the nations and gather them from the four corners of the earth
The sea of Egypt is the Red Sea, and the tongue of the sea of Egypt is the Gulf of Suez, the gulf of the Red Sea
That river will be stricken into seven streams, so that God's people can walk through it to return to their land
We have pointed out in the past that the entire world situation is the preparation for the Lord's move in His gospel
The book of Isaiah shows that God's chastisement of His chosen people and His judgment of the nations ushers in Christ
The brothers who have traveled to Russia recently have shared that the Lord has opened up Russia to our publications
In Paul's second journey, he and his co-workers intended to speak the word in Asia, but they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit
Philippi was a fortified outpost of the Roman Empire in a foreign country where the citizens had equal rights with those at the capital Rome
As a fort of the ancient empire of Rome, Philippi was a very strategic city for the spread of the gospel at its beginning in Europe
Many young ones among us have been trained in the past few years, and we presently have over one hundred in the full-time training
It may be that in our next term of training, we will change our language lessons to Russian, French, and German, plus British English
If one has a knowledge of these four languages, he can travel and speak to people throughout nearly all of Europe and Russia
Deuteronomy 8:7 speaks of the good land as 'a land of waterbrooks, of springs and of fountains, flowing forth in valleys and in mountains'
The fountain is the source, the spring is the issue of the source, and the waterbrook, or the river, is the flow
When God's salvation is experienced by us, this salvation becomes our strength, and eventually it will be our song, our praising
The water is the processed Triune God becoming a fountain out of which we can have the springs of salvation for our enjoyment and experience
In Revelation 21:6 the Lord says, 'I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely'
The source of this water is a fountain, which is immeasurably deep and wide, and this fountain has many springs
The springs at Niagara Falls are not drinkable because they are too great and fierce, but Jesus is a gentle spring
The air sends water to the earth in the form of rain, and the water on the earth vaporizes and goes back to the air
In order for the Lord Jesus to go from the throne in the heavens to the cross on Mount Cavalry, He had to pass through many processes
In order to draw water from the springs of salvation we should make Gods saving deeds known among the peoples and exalt His name among them
We also need to sing to Him for He has done something majestic, and we must let this be made known in all the earth
We need to realize, however, that we can also enjoy Christ as the reigning One in the tent of David in the age of grace
Luke reports the angel telling Mary that the One conceived in her womb would be given 'the throne of David His father'
We have to realize that, according to Hebrews 6:5, the age of grace, the new testament age, is a foretaste of the coming age
Divine healing is a part of the restoration in the coming age, but today in the age of grace we may also enjoy and receive divine healing
Isaiah 16:5 shows that with Christ there is lovingkindness, truthfulness, faithfulness, justice, and righteousness
When Christ will reign as Jehovah of hosts in Zion and Jerusalem, the moon will be abashed, and the sun will be ashamed
For it will be Jehovah of hosts who will reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and His glory will be before His elders
Every human being apart from Christ has nothing to trust in, but we have the Lord as the eternal Rock to trust in
Isaiah 17:10 says, 'For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, / And the Rock of your stronghold you have not remembered
We have gladness in our heart as those who are marching to the flute to go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel
Isaiah 19:20 reveals that Christ is also a Savior a Defender, who is the Mighty One, especially for Egypt the Gentiles
And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, / This is the way, walk in it, / When you turn to the right or turn to the left'
In the Old Testament, Christ hid Himself in a mystery, but in the age of restoration He will be manifested to Israel
Whenever we come to a crossroad, He is there at the corner, telling us whether we should turn to the right or to the left
Isaiah 39:2 records how Hezekiah showed the Babylonian visitors his treasury, which literally means 'the house of his precious things'
We may say that whatever is in the New Testament concerning Christ was already referred to in the Old Testament
We also need to realize that there are many details in the Old Testament that cannot be found in the New Testament
The New Testament does not tell us that Christ is a peg, a nail, and no New Testament verse tells us directly that Christ is the throne
The New Testament tells us that Christ is a slave, a servant of God, but it does not tell us directly that Christ is a steward
The New Testament says that we believers are stewards , but it does not use the word steward in reference to Christ
In ancient times, a large family would have a steward to dispense the riches of the household to all of its members
The book of Genesis records that Joseph was such a steward of Pharaoh's house to distribute the riches of this house
In the late 1960s and early 1970s in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, a number of hippies were saved and came into the church life
Isaiah 22:21b says that Eliakim, typifying Christ, will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah
The more we go on as children of God, the more we realize that our Savior, Christ, is our Source and our Supplier
The all-inclusive Christ, as typified by Eliakim, is also the One upon whose shoulder the key of the house of God is set
The house of David was for the establishment of the kingdom of David, and the house of God is for the establishment of the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is not that evident today because the house of God has not been strongly and adequately built up
The subject was seemingly changed from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ to a book-by-book exposition of the New Testament
To be exalted to the third heaven is to be exalted to God the Father because the Father is in the third heaven
Without the book of Isaiah, we would not know that when God exalted Christ, God drove Him as a peg into the place where He is, the heavens
The Hebrew word for bowls may also be translated cups, and the Hebrew word for jars refers to large, bulging bottles or pitchers
Some of the children of God are smaller, like cups, and others are bigger, like jars, bulging bottles, or pitchers
Cups, or bowls, are small vessels to contain water, and bulging bottles, pitchers, or jars are big vessels to contain wine
Isaiah 22:24 indicates that the vessels, which are for containing water and wine, are hanging upon Christ as the peg
At the end of the first section of Isaiah, from chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine, there is the account concerning Hezekiah
In the next message we will begin to see the aspects of Christ in chapter forty, the first chapter of the second section of Isaiah
Today the nations are debating about what land should belong to Israel and what land should belong to the Palestinians
Isaiah 28:5 says, 'In that day Jehovah of hosts / Will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of His people'
Generally speaking, a crown signifies glory, but its beauty is in its diadem, which may be full of jewels and precious stones
Some Christians may talk about other persons or things in a glorious way but when they come to the subject of Christ they may feel shameful
When we are defeated, we feel ashamed, but when we repent and receive the dispensing Christ in a fresh way, we feel glorious
In my study of this portion of the Word, one reference book quoted a proverb which said that haste is of the devil
Even today we are not only held by Him as our foundation stone but also joined together by Him as our cornerstone
The Lord Jesus quoted Psalm 118:22-23 by saying that the stone which the builders rejected was made the cornerstone by God
In verse 11 he mentioned Christ as the cornerstone, and in verse 12 he indicated that today this cornerstone is our Savior
Isaiah 32:1 says, 'Behold, a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice'
When judgment is exercised on someone according to what he is and has done, that verdict, that judgment, is justice
Christ will reign according to righteousness, and He will rule through His helpers, the rulers, to judge the people according to justice
A natural desert was not made that way by human hands, but a wasted land has been touched by some, wasted by some
In the United States government these three branches are always balancing one another, but many times they fight against one another
The system of communism was formulated by Karl Marx according to the biblical practice in Acts 2 of the believers having all things common
Nothing can compete with the divine revelation in the Bible because the Bible is the writing of our God, who knows everything
Isaiah tells us that our Savior, Christ, is a King to reign according to righteousness and to rule according to justice
The first section is composed of the first thirty-nine chapters, and the second section is composed of the final twenty-seven chapters
In verse 3, the voice cries, 'Make clear / The way of Jehovah; / Make straight in the desert / A highway for our God'
Jesus comes with the intention of getting into our spirit, but to enter into our spirit, He must pass through our heart
In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus told us that He was sent by the Father and that He did not speak from Himself
He was speaking from His Father, His teaching was altogether of His Father, and His speaking was the expression of the Father
When we heard the gospel, we saw Jesus, we were made alive, and we partook of His eternal life for our enjoyment
As fallen men, we were like withering grass and fading flowers, yet we heard the living word, which is abiding forever
In Matthew 5 the Lord spoke nine blessings for the kingdom people, but in Matthew 23 He spoke an eightfold woe to the scribes and Pharisees
His regulating shepherds us to bring us into the flock, to get us on the right way, and to adjust us to the proper pace
As the Shepherd, He also feeds His flock, gathers the lambs in His arm, carries them in His bosom, and leads those who are nursing the young
They will begin to know that their Savior, Jesus, is the Holy One, the eternal God, Jehovah, and the Creator of the heavens and the earth
As you feed him, however, he will come to know that he is like a drop of water from a bucket or a speck of dust on the heavenly scale
The more they realize that they are nothing, empty, and vanity, the more they will appreciate Christ and be filled up with Christ
The fifth aspect of the glad tidings in Isaiah 40 is that Jehovah the Savior empowers and strengthens those who wait on Him
We have been fed by Him to know Him as the Holy One, the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth
He then gives us the eagles' wings to mount up, so that we can run the course of the Christian life without fainting or becoming weary
The Lord Jehovah is the Old Testament Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus Christ is the New Testament Lord Jehovah
The first chapter of the second section of Isaiah is chapter forty, where Christ is revealed as Jehovah the Savior
The revealing of the Lord Jehovah is the appearing of the very God, and this Lord Jehovah, the very God, is the Lord Jesus Christ
In this message we want to cover the revelation of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in chapters forty-one through fifty
Now we need to consider what these servants as types of Christ did and what Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is doing today
They surely were one with God to carry out His commission to build the temple as the center and reality of God's interest on the earth
The new man is enlarged to be the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the holy city, the tabernacle of God and the temple of God
He was also Jehovahs shepherd for the fulfilling of His desire in building up the city and the temple of God and in releasing Gods captives
Cyrus was used by God to release God's captured elect, to build His house, His household, and to establish His kingdom on this earth
In eternity past God chose millions of people, but they all were captured by Satan, typified by that evil Nebuchadnezzar
Israel as a type of Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, was chosen by Jehovah and upheld with the right hand of His righteousness
Just as the Spirit was poured out upon Christ, the Spirit of Jehovah was poured out upon Israel for the blessing of his offspring
Cyrus, the Gentile king, Israel, God's chosen people, and Isaiah, the prophet set up by God, all did the same thing to please God
They served to release God's people, to build up God's house, and to build up God's kingdom signified by the city
We need to have the realization that we are today's Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah because we are one with our Lord Jesus Christ
The New Testament tells us that when the Lord Jesus was sent by the Father, the Father sent Him with the Spirit of God
These three servants Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah, are wrapped up with the fourth Servant, the all-inclusive Christ
Both Israel and the nations are fully qualified to inherit Jesus Christ as the covenant and to enjoy Him as the light
His righteousness binds Him, and His righteousness gives us the ground, the standing, to say, 'God, You have to save me'
Now His death has accomplished all the requirements of God's righteousness according to His law, so this death gives us a righteous ground
Whether we are good or bad, God has to save us because our Savior died for us to fulfill all of God's righteousness
God's salvation, God's blessings, and all of God's riches have been covenanted to us, and this covenant is just Christ
Just as my title deed equals my house, Christ equals all of God's salvation, blessings, grace, reality, and riches
What if your father had a will which said that you were entitled to ten million dollars, twenty houses, and fifteen commercial ships
Christ is our title deed, and this title deed is in our spirit as the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit
Christ is the covenant, and this Christ who is the covenant is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us
Christ, the Servant of Jehovah as a covenant to the people of Israel and a light to the nations has a source, an origin
He was God from eternity past, He is still God today, and He will be God in the future, so He is the One who was, who is, and who shall be
Some people may boast about their source, about where they are from, but actually our source as human beings means nothing
Our president has been selected and chosen by the people, but this cannot be compared to being selected and chosen by God
Genesis 2:7 says that God formed man's body of the dust of the ground, and He formed a spirit within man with His breath
In every aspect, in every way, in every direction, and on every side, the calling of Jehovah rendered to Jesus was right
Helped may be a small word in our understanding, but actually Jehovah's helping Jesus was His doing everything for Jesus
Even though He was mistreated by and subjected to tyrants, He was still respected by kings and worshipped by princes
Because the plants in the Old Testament are types of Christ in His humanity, Christ is also typified by a reed and flax
Some of the Lord's people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound, but the Lord will not break these bruised ones
Some of the Lord's people are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light, yet the Lord will not extinguish these smoking ones
Christ as our substitute was judged by God according to His righteous law, completely fulfilling all the requirements of that law
To establish justice in the earth means to establish God's salvation, which is the issue of God's judgment on Christ
Now the salvation, or the gospel we preach, is this kind of justice that comes out of God's judgment over Christ's righteousness
After this sealing, the Holy Spirit stays in us as a pledge to guarantee us that we have the right to inherit God as our inheritance
God is life; God is love; God is righteousness; God is holiness; God is power; God is strength; and God is might
He died for us according to God's righteous requirements, and the blood He shed through that death was used to form a covenant
In resurrection Christ became the bequests of the new testament and the Mediator, the Executor, to execute the new testament
We not only have the items of the new testament in our mind, but we also have the reality of this covenant, who is Christ, in our spirit
Christ as the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead and as the crucified and resurrected One has become the covenant of God to His people
The commission of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is also to bring forth justice for salvation in truth to the nations
Romans 1:16 and 17 say that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, for the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel
Romans 5:18 says that the result of the one righteous act, the act of Christ, was justification of life to all men
Christ was commissioned to open the eyes of the blind that they may see the divine and spiritual things concerning God's eternal economy
The last item of Christ's commission is to bring the prisoner out from the prison, those who dwell in darkness out from the prison house
Christ brings us out of the prison house that we may be released from the dark kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God's beloved Son
Apparently, it is not difficult to grasp logically the thought that Christ is the light given by God to the nations
The entire Scripture of sixty-six books is embodied in these two things in Christ being the covenant and in Christ being the light
Sorry to say, nearly all the readers of the Bible have their eyes covered concerning this matter, and thus they cannot see this
The Bible shows us that God has an economy, an eternal plan, to dispense Himself into us as our life, our person, and our everything
All the sinners, all the descendents of Adam, are under God's condemnation because of the breaching of God's righteousness
Even if we were able to establish our own righteousness, that righteousness would not measure up to the standard of God's righteousness
God promised Abraham that he would have a son from God and that this son would be a blessing to all the nations of the earth
Sarah, Abraham's wife, proposed that he bear a son through her maidservant, Hagar, and Abraham accepted that proposal
Genesis 15:6 says that after hearing God's word, Abraham believed God, and his believing was counted by God as righteousness
We need to receive Him first as our righteousness then as our life then as our person then as our everything and finally as our inheritance
In the evening before His death, He established a table for His disciples that they might remember Him and enjoy Him
It is through Christ's blood that we can receive and gain God's forgiveness, and God's forgiveness equals God's justification
In the new covenant it seems that we have received many things, but actually we have gained only one thing Christ
In His resurrection He became a lifegiving Spirit that He might enter into us to enliven us to germinate us to animate us to make us alive
By itself, Christ's death cannot impart life to us to make us alive that we may enjoy all the issues of God's justification
As such a Spirit, Christ entered into us to enliven us, to bring life into us, to impart the divine life into us to make us alive
In this way we were regenerated to be God's children, to be no longer merely justified sinners but children of God
Many times the Old Testament, especially the book of Jeremiah, says that Israel will be God's people and He will be their God
For us to be God's people means that we are God's inheritance, and for God to be our God means that He is our inheritance
That was the reason that He desired to dispense Himself into us, to make us all His children; and all His children are now His inheritance
By this we can understand the significance of this simple word: 'I will be your God, and you will be My people'
On the one hand we may say that the Bible unveils to us the central line of the divine revelation which is Gods economy and Gods dispensing
Within the city the river of life flows and the tree of life grows as a vine along the two banks of the river, to supply the entire city
Ultimately, God's full salvation is Christ as the covenant plus Christ as the light, and this is the composition of the New Jerusalem
In his Gospel and in the beginning of his first Epistle, the apostle John did not touch the matter of righteousness
When we receive God's justification according to Christ as God's righteousness, the issue in us of this justification is the divine life
Christ as the Servant of Jehovah serves God by being a covenant and a light to God's chosen people that He may be the full salvation of God
He said that He was the good Shepherd who would lay down His soulish life for the sheep that He might minister the divine life to them
Isaiah 49:6b says, 'I will also set You as a light of the nations / That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth'
There was light, and after that, the different kinds of life the vegetable life, the animal life, and the human life came out of the light
If we do not have such a life, which is of the light, we do not have the assurance that we will be able to inherit God as our inheritance
Since we have such a life, this life is our assurance that ensures our right to inherit God as our inheritance in life
If we call, 'O Lord Jesus,' for ten minutes, we will be in the third heavens; that is, we will be in our spirit
We should not live in our own person; rather, we need to live according to the spirit and remain in our spirit
We need to call on Him, to exercise our spirit; then we need to live according to our spirit, and then remain in our spirit
In Revelation 1:10 the apostle John said that he was in spirit on the Lord's Day; that is, he was remaining in his spirit
God's full salvation is constituted of Christ as the covenant and as the light, and this full salvation is full of springs
Then the glory of Jehovah will be revealed, / And all flesh will see it together, / Because the mouth of Jehovah has spoken'
We need to see that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, occupying twenty-six chapters in Isaiah, is mainly for Israel's return and restoration
As captives in Babylon, the Israelites needed not only to be released but also to return to their fathers' land
It had become a desolation, an uninhabitable wilderness, with no rain, no soil for growing crops, and no food for people to eat
Isaiah 51:9-11 and 52:7-15 reveal that Christ is the Servant of Jehovah as the arm of Jehovah, the reigning God, and the exalted Christ
The final item the exalted Christ does not bear an Old Testament tone; rather, it is an item of God's New Testament economy
In Isaiah 40:9, which speaks concerning the beginning of the New Testament, the glad tidings is, 'Here is your God'!
In Israels return and restoration the allinclusive Christ is first the arm of Jehovah second the reigning God and third the exalted Christ
Isaiah was burdened that the arm of Jehovah would do the same thing in his day so that the captives of Israel would be brought back
In the Bible, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, we are told that God's people need God's redemption
We needed something to fulfill God's righteous requirement so that we could be redeemed from God's condemnation
Israel's firstborn escaped that judgment by being redeemed from God's condemnation through the blood shed by the slain lamb
All the firstborn of the Egyptians were killed, but the firstborn of Israel were redeemed from God's judgment and God's condemnation
After they killed the lamb and put the blood on the doorposts, they entered into their houses and ate the meat of the lamb
All the Arab countries surrounding the small country of Israel have been unable to destroy Israel or to gain any of Israel's territory
To redeem Jerusalem here is to deliver Jerusalem out of any kind of trouble, any kind of oppression, and any kind of tyranny
According to prophecy, a good number of Jews will be left in foreign countries because they are not willing to depart
Far the redeemed, returned, and restored people of God know Christ only as the arm of Jehovah and as the reigning God
Isaiah 53 gives us a full record of Christ's death, including a description of the environment of Christ's death
They know Jehovah, they know the power of Jehovah, they know the strength of Jehovah, and they know the arm of Jehovah
The Jews know God in His power, they know God in His arm, but they do not know God in His New Testament redemption
After His ascension to the heavens, Jesus has been acting prudently and wisely on this earth, and in whatever He has done He has prospered
A recent newspaper article reported that in the parliament of Soviet Russia an announcement was made that Russia no longer wanted atheism
On the one hand, Christ is now glorified, but on the other hand, He still bears the impress of His being disfigured for us
Verse 15 continues, 'For what had not been recounted to them they will see, / And what they had not heard of they will contemplate'
Now they will see these things, and what they had not heard of they will contemplate, that is, they will understand, they will realize
The things spoken of in Isaiah 53 are the things mentioned in 5215 that are to be recounted to be seen to be heard of and to be contemplated
The entire chapter is a recounting, a telling, of the things concerning Christ according to the New Testament gospel
They will know Jesus not merely as the arm of Jehovah and the reigning God, but they will know Him as the exalted Christ
In His incarnation, and even in His daily living for thirty-three and a half years, He was very much disfigured and marred
He was brought to Calvary, a little mount outside of the city of Jerusalem, and He was crucified there for six hours
The last three verses of chapter fifty-two, verses 13-15, and the first verse of chapter fifty-three should be put together
Generally speaking, people either do not know Christ, or they know Christ in a natural way as some kind of great person
The first item is to know Christ as the arm of Jehovah, which refers to the strength, the might, and the power of Jehovah
At the end of Isaiah 52 verse 13 says Behold My Servant will act wisely and will prosper He will be exalted and lifted up and very high
According to John 12:24, Christ's death, like a grain of wheat falling into the ground, released God's divine life
In the resurrection of Christ, not only Christ Himself was born ; millions of Christ's believers also were born in His resurrection
When they come to either the Old Testament or the New Testament, many readers of the Bible hold to their own natural concepts
Isaiah 52:13 53:12 reveals Christ as the Servant of Jehovah not in the Old Testament economy but in the New Testament economy
Isaiah 52:13 says that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah will act wisely and will prosper, implying that He will accomplish great things
According to Isaiah's poetic writing in verse 14, many were astonished at Christ because His appearance and His form were marred
They were astonished because they did not expect a servant of God to be a marred one, a disfigured one, as Christ was
From the day that He came out to minister on this earth, the Lord Jesus acted wisely and prospered in God's pleasure
From the first day of His ministry until the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus did nothing according to the Old Testament economy
The second part of Isaiah 52:13 says that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah will be exalted and lifted up and very high
The human mind cannot understand the meaning of Christ's being exalted and lifted up, because the 'economy' of the human mind is natural
The record in the New Testament is according to the economy of God, which is much higher and much deeper than man's economy
Christ is exalted and lifted up and very high, but when men saw Him, He was different from what they expected Him to be
All the great teachers, such as Confucius and Socrates, spoke great words, but Jesus always tried to speak small words
In a sense, to preach the gospel is an easy thing; actually, however, it is the most difficult thing on this earth
When we go to speak to people concerning Jesus, we often feel that it is difficult to present such a One to them
The first part of verse 2 says, 'For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground'
In the New Testament economy, it was unveiled and reported concerning Christ that He was like a tender plant, like a root out of dry ground
Based on this account we would not consider such a One as a great man, nor would we consider ourselves inferior to such a One
As our Redeemer, Christ sacrificed Himself for our trespasses, or, for our sin, for the accomplishing of Jehovah's eternal redemption
Our Redeemer was crucified, sacrificing Himself for our trespasses for the accomplishing of God's eternal redemption
However, according to our natural human thought, we might wonder how such words could be considered as glad tidings
Verse 4 says Surely He has borne our sicknesses And carried our sorrows Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken Smitten of God and afflicted
People thought that Christ must have been wrong in something; otherwise, why would He be stricken, smitten of God and afflicted?
He was stricken, smitten, afflicted, wounded, crushed, and chastened in our place that we may be healed , that we may be saved
The stroke should have fallen upon the Jewish people, but Christ as the Servant of Jehovah suffered the stroke for them
Although the term life-giver is not used in these verses, the thought of a life-giver is implied in the seed mentioned in verse 10
Christ's making His soul an offering for sin indicates that He was willing and volunteered to sacrifice Himself as an offering for sin
Christ extended His days by producing a seed the believers to build up the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ is still extending
Although He encountered all kinds of attacks, all kinds of opposition, and all kinds of troubles, no one has been able to defeat Him
The pleasure of Jehovah is to reveal Himself into us, to make us the seed of Christ, to make us a part of Christ, to make us the sons of God
They will all become Christ's seed; they will all become the members of His Body to build up the Body as His organism
Ephesians 4:8-12 tells us that when Christ ascended to the height, He led captive those who were taken captive by Satan
The victory was gained by God through Christ's volunteering to die, through Christ's being willing to be numbered among the transgressors
All the recounting, all the reporting, and all the revelation in this portion of the Word are in the New Testament economy
When we read the Old Testament through without reading Isaiah 53, we receive the impression of the Old Testament economy
When we come to Isaiah 53 and read it, the flavor, the taste, is altogether of the New Testament, not the Old Testament
In the Old Testament, Isaiah 53 is the unique chapter that bears the color, the taste, and the atmosphere of the New Testament
Today the whole world is busy, yet You have separated us unto Yourself that we may come here to know You through Your word
If we desire to know Christ according to Isaiah 53, we must realize that Isaiah 53 speaks clearly concerning Christ in four stages
In this message we will consider the first two stages, and in the next two messages we will see the last two stages
Zechariah 12 tells us that when the Lord Jesus comes back, the household of Israel will be saved on the same day and even at the same time
Two thousand years ago, when the Lord Jesus came out of Nazareth to preach the gospel, that was the unveiling of the arm of Jehovah
A number of times in the four Gospels the Jews despised the Lord Jesus, speaking words such as, 'Can anything good be from Nazareth'?
If Jesus had come out of Bethlehem, out of the city of the royal family, perhaps many Jews would believe in Him
They have not believed, because He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah, and like a root out of dry ground
As the complete God, signified by the arm of Jehovah, the power of God , Christ became a perfect man, signified by a man of sorrows
His mother, Mary, and her husband, Joseph, lived in a despised city called Nazareth, in a despised region, Galilee
It is true that they were descendants of David, but David reigned approximately one thousand years before Jesus was born
The Lord Jesus had no attracting form nor majesty that men should look upon Him, nor beautiful appearance that men should desire Him
If Jesus had been very handsome and attractive, very majestic and powerful, everyone would have been attracted to Him
Of majesty, He had poverty, and instead of a beautiful appearance, He had a visage and form that were disfigured
Christ bore our sicknesses at the moment He was judged by God on the cross, in the hour when God put all our iniquities upon Him
Christ was wounded by the nails in His hands and His feet, by the spear that pierced His side, and by the crown of thorns on His head
Christ was not only wounded for our transgressions, but He was also crushed for our iniquities, our evildoings
Since at the time of Matthew 8 Christ had not yet died to bear people's sicknesses, how could people be healed by Christ at that time?
In speaking of Christ's crucifixion, Isaiah's sequence proceeds from Christ's being oppressed to His being numbered with the transgressors
After Christ died, a rich man, Joseph of Arimathea, came to claim His body, and he put the body into a new tomb
In Isaiah 53:6, the phrase us all refers to the remnant of the Jews at the time of the Lord Jesus' coming back
Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall upon the man who was oppressed, judged, afflicted, and crucified
If a man dies while attempting to rescue someone who is drowning, that death can be considered a bold death but not a vicarious death
They say that Christ's death can be considered only a martyrdom and that Christ is nothing more than a martyred hero
No doubt Christ was killed, but His death should not be considered as only a murder for the cause of martyrdom
Christs death was not merely a murder nor was it a martyrdom rather it was a death for the accomplishing of redemption a redeeming death
In God's economy the Father condemned and forsook the Son, and the Spirit was with the Son to support and strengthen Him
Far, we can see that in Christ's crucifixion, man did something, God did something, and Christ Himself did something
Christ's crucifixion could not have been accomplished without the participation of any one of the three parties
Through Christ's redemption, we are justified unto this life union in His resurrection, the reality of which is the life-giving Spirit
Christ's death was not merely a murder, nor was it a martyrdom; it was a redemption carried out by the Substitute for God's chosen people
Since we believe in Him as our Savior, have received Him as our Redeemer, and trust in Him as our life, we should know Him
Isaiah said that Christ would see the outcome, that is, the issue, of the travail of His soul, and He would be satisfied
It must be in resurrection that the living Christ lives in us so that He can be lived out of us as righteousness
The righteousnesses of the saints refer to the subjective righteousness lived out of us by our living of Christ
Christ in His resurrection will make us all righteous by Himself as the resurrection life being lived out of us
There in the heavens He and the Father, who is the great One and also the strong One, shared the prey and divided the spoil
In Paul's definition of Christ's resurrection, many items concerning the produce of Christ's resurrection are unveiled to us
John 1:1 indicates this, saying, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
It is wrong to say that only God was lying there in the manger, because He was lying there not only as God but also as a little boy
He traveled all around the holy land from north to south, mainly from Galilee to Jerusalem, on the west side of the Jordan
In Matthew 17:1-8, He ascended with His disciples, Peter, James, and John, to Mount Hermon and was transfigured before their eyes
Six days before, He had told His disciples that some among them would not taste death until they saw the Son of Man coming in His kingdom
He was led as a lamb to the slaughter , and He was slaughtered by man for three hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until noon
Not only so, the earth was shaken and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had died were raised
At the time that Christ resurrected they also resurrected and they came out of the tombs and entered into the holy city and appeared to many
In John 73738 at the end of the Feast of Tabernacles the Lord Jesus stood and cried out If anyone thirsts let him come to Me and drink
On the day of His glorification, that is, the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples as the Spirit
Let us come to Christ as our 'gasoline station' to get the spiritual gasoline, the spiritual air, and the spiritual water
In His resurrection Christ, as the preeminent One, the One who has the first place in all things, became the Firstborn from among the dead
Since at least these two were resurrected before the Lord Jesus was, how could Jesus be considered the Firstborn from among the dead?
In His resurrection, Christ became the Germinator of the new creation, and He also became the Head, the top One, of the Body
Christ's resurrection was a great birth, a great delivery, of a corporate child, which includes Christ and all His believers
Hebrews 1:6 says that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will not come as the Only Begotten but as the firstborn Son of God

Colossians 2:15 says that while Christ was hanging on the cross, the Father stripped off the rulers and authorities, the evil angelic powers
Before that time Satan had induced a group of angels to rebel against God and to follow him and become his subordinates
When Christ was crucified on the cross, there was a war between the good angels and the evil angels, and even between God and Satan
If we read only the four Gospels, we will not be able to see that during Christ's crucifixion a war was raging between God and Satan

According to Ephesians 1:7 we were redeemed into Christ not only as a person but also as a sphere and as an element
Christ was ordained to be such a High Priest to minister to the believers the heavenly things with all the riches of the heavenly Christ

Christ has been ordained to be the great High Priest to save the believers to the uttermost by interceding for them

Eventually, David's very descendant would be the King of kings on this earth to be the sure mercies to the entire royal family of David
According to Jeremiah, the children of Israel at the time of the exile to Babylon were in a pitifully low situation
In Matthew 23:37-38 the Lord said, 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!
The first exile by the Babylonians lasted only seventy years, but this final exile lasted about two thousand years
Today there is a controversy among Israel and neighboring Arab countries about how much land Israel should have
According to the Scriptures the good land extends from the shore of the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates River where present day Iraq is
There Paul indicates that the sure mercies promised to David are the resurrected Christ, who never saw the corruption of death
