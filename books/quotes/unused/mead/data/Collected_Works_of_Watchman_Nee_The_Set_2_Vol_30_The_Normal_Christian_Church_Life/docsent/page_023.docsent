   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCHES FOUNDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE APOSTLES THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Word of God teaches us that the Church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why then did the apostles found separate churches in each of the places they visited?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the Church is the Body of Christ, it cannot but be one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then how does it come about that we speak of churches?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "church" means "the called-out ones."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The term is used twice in the Gospels, once in Matthew 16:18 and once in Matthew 18:17, and we meet in quite frequently in the Acts and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Gospels the word is used on both occasions by our Lord, but it is employed in a somewhat different sense each time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What church is this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter confessed that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, and our Lord declared that He would build His Church upon this confession the confession that as to His Person He is the Son of God, and as to His work He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Church comprises all the saved, without reference to time or space, that is, all who in the purpose of God are redeemed by virtue of the shed blood of the Lord Jesus, and are born again by the operation of His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the Church universal, the Church of God, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church" Matt 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word "church" is used here in quite a different sense from the sense in Matthew 16:18.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sphere of the church referred to here is clearly not as wide as the sphere of the Church mentioned in the previous passage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Church there is a Church that knows nothing of time or place, but the church here is obviously limited both to time and place, for it is one that can hear you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Church mentioned in chapter sixteen includes all the children of God in every locality, while the church mentioned in chapter eighteen includes only the children of God living in one locality; and it is because it is limited to one place that it is possible for you to tell your difficulties to the believers of whom it is composed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Obviously the church here is local, not universal, for no one could speak at one time to all the children of God throughout the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is only possible to speak at one time to the believers living in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have clearly two different aspects of the Church before us the Church and the churches, the universal Church and the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Church is invisible; the churches are visible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Church has no organization; the churches are organized.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Church is spiritual; the churches are spiritual and yet physical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Church is purely an organism; the churches are an organism, yet at the same time they are organized, which is seen by the fact that elders and deacons hold office there.1</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All Church difficulties arise in connection with the local churches, not with the universal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The latter is invisible and spiritual, therefore beyond the reach of man, while the former is visible and organized, therefore still liable to be touched by human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The heavenly Church is so far removed from the world that it is possible to remain unaffected by it, but the earthly churches are so close to us, that if problems arise there we feel them acutely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The invisible church does not test our obedience to God, but the visible churches test us severely by facing us with issues on the intensely practical plane of our earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE BASIS OF THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Word of God we find "the church of God" spoken of in the singular 1 Cor 10:32 , but we find the same Word referring to the "churches of God" in the plural 1 Thes 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How has this unity become a plurality?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How has the Church which is essentially one become many?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Church of God has been divided into the churches of God on the one ground of difference of locality.1 Locality is the only scriptural basis for the division of the Church into churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven churches in Asia, referred to in the book of Revelation, comprised the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, the church in Thyatira, the church in Sardis, the church in Philadelphia, and the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were seven churches, not one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each was distinct from the others on the ground of the difference of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was only because the believers did not reside in one place that they did not belong to one church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were seven different churches simply because the believers lived in seven different places.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea are clearly all the names of places.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only were the seven churches in Asia founded on the basis of locality, but all the churches mentioned in Scripture were founded on the same basis.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Throughout the Word of God we can find no name attached to a church save the name of a place, for example, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Lystra, the church in Derbe, the church in Colosse, the church in Troas, the church in Thessalonica, the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This fact cannot be overemphasized, that in Scripture no other name but the name of a locality is ever connected with a church, and division of the church into churches is solely on the ground of difference of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spiritually the Church of God is one; therefore, it cannot be divided but physically its members are scattered throughout the earth; therefore, they cannot possibly live in one place.2 Yet it is essential that there be a physical gathering together of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not enough that they be present "in the spirit"; they must also be present "in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now a church is composed of all "the called-out ones assembled" in one place for worship, prayer, fellowship, and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This assembling together is absolutely essential to the life of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without it, there may be believers scattered throughout the area, but there is really no church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Church exists because of the existence of its members, and it does not require that they meet in a physical way; but it is essential to the very existence of a church that its members gather together in a physical way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is in this latter sense that the word "church" is used in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The phrase "in the church" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>19, 23, 28 means "in the church meetings."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A church is a church assembled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These believers are not separated from other believers in any respect but that of their dwelling places.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as they continue in the flesh, they will be limited by space, and this physical limitation, which in the very nature of things makes it impossible for God's people to meet in one place, is the only basis sanctioned by God for the forming of separate churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christians belong to different churches for the sole reason that they live in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That division is merely external.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In reality the church as the Body of Christ cannot be divided; therefore, even when the Word of God refers to the different assemblies of His people, the places named vary, but it is still "the church" in every one of these places, such as "the church in Ephesus," "the church in Smyrna," "the church in Pergamos."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the New Testament there is one method and one alone of dividing the Church into churches, and that God-ordained method is division on the basis of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All other methods are man-made, not God-given.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the Spirit of God engrave this truth deeply on our hearts, that the only reason for the division of God's children into different churches is because of the different places in which they live.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is a New Testament church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not a building, a gospel hall, a preaching center, a mission, a work, an organization, a system, a denomination, or a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>People may apply the term "church" to any of the above; nevertheless they are not churches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A New Testament church is the meeting together for worship, prayer, fellowship, and mutual edification, of all the people of God in a given locality, on the ground that they are Christians in the same locality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Church is the Body of Christ; a church is a miniature Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the believers in a locality form the church in that locality, and in a small way they ought to show forth what the Church should show forth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They are the Body of Christ in that locality, so they have to learn how to come under the headship of the Lord, and how to manifest oneness among all the members, guarding carefully against schism and division.</S>
