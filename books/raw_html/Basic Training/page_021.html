<h2 class=head1>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. This Spirit must refer to the Spirit of God, for besides the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, there is not another Spirit who gives life. In the universe there is just one unique divine Spirit who gives life. The divine Spirit firstly is God Himself, for God is Spirit. But, as we have seen, John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet. This Spirit is the reality of the Son with the Father. The Father and the Son are realized in the Spirit. The last Adam is included in the life-giving Spirit because the last Adam has become such a Spirit. Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply, not of the Spirit of God, but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The phrase the Spirit of Jesus Christ includes both Jesus, the Nazarene, and Christ, God’s Messiah, the anointed One. Thus, the Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God; the Spirit of God now is both the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7) and the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9).<p>When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He was the realization of God. God was in Him. But now He has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This surely implies that Jesus and Christ are realized in this Spirit. In the Spirit we now have not only the element of God but also the element of Jesus and the element of Christ. Before Jesus was crucified and resurrected, the Spirit of Jesus Christ was not yet, although the Spirit of God was there already. But after Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45.<h2 class=head1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p>The last book of the Bible, Revelation, speaks of the seven Spirits of God (5:6). Recently, I heard someone say that these seven Spirits of God are the seven angels of the seven churches. Revelation 1:20 says that the seven stars are the seven angels, or messengers, of the seven churches, and in Revelation 3:1 the Lord refers to Himself as the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. How then can we say that the seven Spirits of God are the seven angels? This is like saying that a person’s eyes are the same as his feet. There is no doubt that the seven Spirits are the Spirit of God.<p>Notice that in Revelation 5:6 the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb. According to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, the Father is separate from the Son, and the Son is separate from the Spirit. But Revelation 5:6 says that the seven Spirits (the Spirit) are the eyes of the Lamb (the Son). Traditional theology speaks of the three Persons of the Godhead, but according to the book of Revelation, the third is the eyes of the second. How ridiculous it is to separate the third from the second, making them two separate Persons! Some Christians have said, in writing, that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate Persons, but the Bible reveals that the third is the eyes of the second. Are not the seven Spirits of God the Holy Spirit? Then how can the Holy Spirit, the third of the Godhead, be the eyes of the Lamb, the second of the Godhead?<p>Many of those who argue on behalf of the traditional understanding of the Trinity appeal to the Nicene Creed formulated in A.D. 325 at the Council of Nicea. But at the time of that council, seven books of the New Testament, including Revelation, were not yet recognized by the church. These seven books were recognized at the Council of Carthage in North Africa in A.D. 397. When the Nicene Creed was formulated, the book of Revelation had not been recognized as authoritative. Thus, this creed says nothing about the seven Spirits of God. This proves that the creed adopted by the Catholic Church and so many denominations is not complete.<h2 class=head1>THE FIRST MENTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Do you know the first time the title Holy Spirit is used? This title cannot be found in the Old Testament. In fact, the word holy is not to be found in the book of Genesis. The first time holy is used is in relation to the calling of Moses in Exodus 3. God told Moses to take off his shoes because he was standing on holy ground (v. 5). In Psalm 51:11 and in Isaiah 63:10-11 the King James Version mistakenly uses the term Holy Spirit. Instead, these verses speak of “the Spirit of Your holiness” and “His Spirit of holiness.” Only in the New Testament do we find mention of the Holy Spirit. The title Holy Spirit is first used when Mary was about to conceive the Lord Jesus (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:35). Thus, the term the Holy Spirit is used first regarding the incarnation of Christ.
