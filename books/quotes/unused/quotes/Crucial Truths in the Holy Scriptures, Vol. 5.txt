These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo
They lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation
The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God
We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible
If our works and acts are not according to God's will, we will be disciplined in the future even though we are saved
In 1 Corinthians 3 we can clearly see that there is a matter of reward and loss apart from salvation and perdition
In the future some believers will not only be saved but also rewarded; however, some believers will suffer loss despite being saved
In contrast, only faithful followers will obtain the crown of righteousness since it manifests God's righteousness
For the sake of the Lord and His testimony, they do not love themselves to the extent that they willingly give up their lives
Since they are one with the Lord's heart in caring for the flock of God, the Lord will reward them with an unfading crown of glory
As a reward the Lord will give an incorruptible crown to those who put away the pleasures of the world and run in His course
For the sake of running the Lord's course, some will put away all the corruptible, temporary things of the world, which are passing away
When the Lord comes to rule the world, He will give them authority over the nations, and they will rule and exercise authority with Him
In the millennial kingdom the Lord will give them double honor and qualify them to be both a king and a priest
We can freely obtain God's salvation by grace, but we must pay a high price to obtain God's reward according to righteousness
After our salvation, if our labor before the Lord is of gold, silver, and precious stones, the Lord will reward us
If our labor is of wood, grass, or stubble, the Lord will not only refuse to reward us but will also cause us to suffer loss
The Lord will reward us even for works such as loving our enemy, doing good, and lending without expecting anything in return
If we want to obtain the Lord's reward, we must act according to the Lord's regulations, have self-control, and be restricted in everything
If we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of for the Lord's sake, we will be rewarded, and the reward will be great
Diligent students are happy on the day of a big test because if they do well on the test, they will receive a reward
Loving the Lords appearing is a proof that we love the Lord and live for Him today therefore this is a requirement for obtaining the reward
We must, however, appear before the judgment seat of Christ to determine whether we will receive a reward or punishment
In the future believers will be judged according to their works after salvation to determine whether they should be rewarded or punished
In the future believers will stand before the judgment seat of God for which Christ bears the responsibility and we will be rewarded by Him
The Bible not only teaches us concerning the matter of receiving the reward but also shows us patterns of pursuing the reward
Paul tells us that he ran in this way, not as though without a clear aim, and that he boxed in this way, not as though beating the air
He ran until he was old, and when he wrote Philippians from prison, he still did not dare say that he had laid hold of it
If one wants to run well, he must forget the things which are behind and stretch forward to the things which are before
It was only when he was about to be martyred for the Lord that he dared to say that he had obtained the reward
Our salvation is as secure as Paul's, but after his salvation he endeavored to run the race and pursue the reward
Salvation is one hundred percent according to God's grace, whereas obtaining the reward is based fully on His righteousness
Not long after man was created, Satan deceived and corrupted man , which frustrated the establishment of God's authority on earth
Satan invented culture and influenced man to rely upon himself for his living so that man would ignore God's means of salvation
Noah however found favor in the sight of God accepted His way of salvation walked with Him submitted to His authority and was ruled by Him
After Noah left the ark, God gave man authority to govern other men , but Satan used man's God-given authority to establish many nations
Satan caused man to leave God's rule to the extent that man fully rebelled against God at Babel in an attempt to overthrow His authority
After Abraham was called by God, he stood in a heavenly position under the rule of God, and God's authority once again had a way on earth
God came in to save them out of Egypt in order to make them His kingdom wherein He could exercise His authority and express His glory
At this time, they lost their kingdom to the Babylonians, and God lost the realm on earth where He could exercise His authority
Later Ezra, Nehemiah, and a group of Israelites were raised up, so God again gained a place on earth where He could exercise His authority
When He met a demon, He would cast it out so that the authority of God and the kingdom of God would be extended
Consequently, the Lord told them that the kingdom of God would be taken from them and given to another group of people-the church
Today the kingdom of God, the realm where God exercises His authority on earth, has passed from the Jews-the Israelites-to the church
Inwardly, she was full of sins, human opinions, and the world, giving Satan ground and frustrating God's authority from freely moving
The overcomers represent the church to deal with Satan's authority of darkness so that God can freely exercise His authority
According to the Lord's words, He is the kingdom of the heavens coming to the earth to sow Himself as the seed of life on earth
The church should sojourn like a pilgrim on the earth but also be full of the element of life and the function to nourish and feed people
As a great tree, Christianity represents the false, worldly, and outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens on earth today
The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened'
These different kinds of leaven have caused all of Christendom in its outward appearance to be inwardly corrupted
These parables speak only of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens and the condition within its outward appearance
The kingdom of the heavens is the reign of the heavens where God dwells; simply speaking, it is the rule of the heavens
Only overcoming believers know this reality everyone elseincluding both defeated genuine believers and false Christianshave no part in it
The words that the Lord spoke on the mountain in Matthew 5 through 7 are related to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
When a person is poor in spirit, he is under the ruling of the heavens, and he is in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
By being poor and empty in spirit, there is a constant pursuit of spiritual growth and of God's riches, which are simply God Himself
Consequently, he does not have to wait to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, because the kingdom of the heavens is his already
Such ones feel empty and lacking in spiritual matters, especially in God Himself, and thus are desperately seeking
Such ones are as lambs led to the slaughter, suffering persecution without resisting and enduring opposition, shame, and attack
Such ones seek to have their actions and behavior according to God's righteous ways and to keep themselves righteous
Through their actions, they shine out God-who is light-before men, causing others to see God and the light of His glory in them
These matters refer to their influence on the world from their living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
Their living exceeds the standard of the righteousness of the law, being absolutely holy with a surpassing righteousness
They do not speak loose words; their speaking is accurate and honest: Yes is yes and no is no, without additional words
In loving others, they do not have their own choices or preferences but are perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect
When they give alms, their motive is pure, so they do not let their left hand know what their right hand is doing
They also confess their sins before God and ask Him to keep them from temptation and to deliver them from the evil one
When they fast before God, they do not show others that they are fasting; they are spiritual without appearing to be spiritual
They do not allow earthly riches to entangle their hearts; they allow only the God of the heavens to fill their hearts
They strive to submit to God's authority, to be according to God's ways, and to not care for the needs of their living
They know only to submit to God's authority, to be according to God's ways, and to not worry about how they will live tomorrow
These items speak of the attitude toward riches of those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
Those who are under the governance of the heavens do not judge the mistakes of others but think only of their own shortcomings
When they preach the Word or give a testimony, they have no fleshly interests and do not follow their own desires
They ask for the Lord's grace, pay the price to seek the Lord Himself, and spend time to knock in prayer; they live before the Lord
They do not desire human greatness, nor do they allow themselves leeway; they constantly live in life and take life as the goal
They guard against false prophets and do not easily believe human reasoning; they examine the fruits of preachers and test their behavior
They single-mindedly seek God's good pleasure; they do not ask to be welcomed by man nor do they follow their own desires
He can keep the law and be orderly much more than other human beings because the heavens rule, govern, and restrict him
If we can be loose when no one is ruling us and if we can do things that are unethical or illegal we are not under the ruling of the heavens
Although the kingdom of the heavens has not yet been manifested, we can live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today
They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years'; 'Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection;
The Bible shows that when the Lord returns, the kingdom of the heavens will come to earth to reign and rule over the earth
They will sit in glory on thrones together with the Lord to reign and enter into the joy of the Lord in the kingdom
Christendom is merely the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, not the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of the heavens is hidden from the worldly people, but it will be manifested when the Lord Jesus returns to rule the earth
In the future the Lord will return to deal with Satan , and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of the Lord
In the glorious appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, there will be no portion for defeated Christians, much less for false Christians
Matthew 21:43 shows that before the kingdom of the heavens came, the kingdom of God was already in the midst of the Israelites
They will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God'
Ephesians 5:5 and Revelation 11:15 reveal that the kingdom of the heavens in the future is also a part of the kingdom of God
According to the Scriptures, the kingdom of God stretches from eternity to eternity, without beginning and without ending
The kingdom of the heavens, which has a beginning and an ending, is a part of the kingdom of God, but its scope is narrower
Matthew 133133 1111 and 811 compared with Luke 131821 728 132829 prove also that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God
We may call the kingdom of the heavens the kingdom of God, but we cannot call the kingdom of God the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens from the birth of the church to the end of the millennium
The millennium refers to the time after Christ comes again as King to rule the world and before the new heaven and new earth
The people to be ruled over by the kings in the future kingdom of the heavens are the ones who will be in the kingdom of Messiah
The third heaven must be the heaven above the heavens, the highest heaven , where the Lord Jesus and God are today
In the future the kingdom of the heavens will be the manifestation of the ruling of the heavens during the millennial kingdom
The church is neither a physical building, nor a place, nor an organization, nor a denomination, nor an evangelistic group
The totality of this people, on one hand, is the Body of Christ , and on the other hand, it is the house of God
In the eyes of God and in the eyes of those who know God, there is a great difference between Christianity and the church
Christianity is that which men have organized in the world; the church is that which God has delivered out of the world
A believer in the church is a member of Christ, enjoying Christ as life, and also a child of God, enjoying the blessing in the house of God
As long as one has the life of God, he is in the church, but he must have a heavenly living in order to be in the kingdom of the heavens
A saved one participates in the church; a saved and overcoming one participates both in the church and in the kingdom of the heavens
Not all of those who are in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are in the church because not all of them are saved
The scope of the church and the scope of the kingdom of God during the dispensation of the church are the same
Not all of those who are in the church are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, because not all of them are overcomers
The scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is narrower than that of the church and the kingdom of God
The scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the scope of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens are related to the overcoming believers
The kingdom of God denotes the life of the believers, which is of God and is capable of living within the realm of God
The kingdom of the heavens denotes the living of the believers who are submitting to the heavenly ruling and receiving heavenly discipline
According to God's intention, the definitions of these three may be different, but their scope should be absolutely the same
Why is the scope of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens wider than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God?
Why is the scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens narrower than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God?
They are still worldly people with no change inwardly; they have merely put on the name of a Christian outwardly
Although all saved believers are in the church and in the kingdom of God, many have fallen from the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
Although they are still children of God they are children who have fallen away from Gods standardthe reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The scope of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens has become narrower than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God
The kingdom of the heavens is divided into two periods: the period of its appearance and reality and the period of its manifestation
The period from John the Baptist to the formal arrival of the kingdom of the heavens was a period of transition
In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus did not say, 'The kingdom of the heavens has become like'
Wherever there is the church, there are also overcoming believers in the church, who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens started together and progressed together with the church
The reality and appearance of the kingdom of the heavens go along with the church and are dependent upon the church
At that time the Lord Jesus will burn the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the so-called Christendom
At the same time the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will become the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Daniel 7:13-14 shows that at the end of this age the Lord Jesus will receive the kingdom from God and come to earth to establish His kingdom
Daniel 2:44-45 shows that at the end of this age the Lord will crush the nations of the earth in order to establish His kingdom
To summarize briefly, the kingdom of the heavens started with the church and will end at the conclusion of the millennium
Before the church existed the kingdom of the heavens was only near and at the end of the millennium the kingdom of the heavens will conclude
The kingdom of the heavens is contained in the two dispensations of the church and the millennium, and it embraces these two dispensations
The preceding section provides a sketch of the beginning and ending of the kingdom of the heavens and its process
The Gospel of Matthew, however, contains twelve parables that provide details concerning the process of the kingdom of the heavens
The first kind of hearer is like the earth beside the way on the edge of the field , which is close to the evil spirits
When this kind of hearer hears the word of the kingdom of the heavens, he cannot understand it, and Satan easily snatches it away
The parable of the tares speaks of the beginning, continuation, and end of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
The seed that the Lord sowed in the preceding parable becomes 'the sons of the kingdom' in this parable; they are the true believers
Once the false believers are separated from the true believers, the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens-Christendom-will end
According to history, this abnormal development began when the Roman emperor Constantine accepted Christianity
The parable of the leaven speaks of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens reaching a point of inward corruption
They show how Satan worked in many ways to damage the word of the kingdom of the heavens to prevent it from bearing fruit
The word still produced sons of the kingdom who could become a kingdom where the heavens could rule, the church
Satan did all these things to damage God's goal for the church and to frustrate the church from bringing in the kingdom of God
When the Lord began His work, He expressed this kingdom ; later, because He was rejected by the Jews, He hid the kingdom from them
Just as the parables of the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven are related, the parables of the treasure and the pearl are also related
These latter two parables speak of the purity and holiness of the kingdom and the church, something that the believers should appreciate
As the church, the saved ones should come out of the world; as the kingdom, the Lord and the believers will inherit the earth
Giving up the world is a requirement related to the church, which enables us, as the kingdom, to obtain the earth
When we give up the world today to be the Lords beloved pearl we will inherit the earth and obtain the Lords precious treasure in the future
To some, the parable of the net repeats what is spoken of in the parable of the tares concerning true believers and false believers
He will condemn those who did not receive that gospel and cause them to enter into the lake of fire to perish eternally
It is only through His calling that people can enter into the realm of His universal work, that is, enter into the vineyard to work
Rather, His reward is based on our consideration of His heart's desire and on our answer to His call to live for His kingdom
Unlike Peter, we should not emphasize our sacrifice and labor; rather, we must focus on the Lord's love, grace, and authority
The parable of the wedding feast in Matthew 22:1-14 speaks of how God calls people to enter into the joy of His kingdom in the age of grace
The age of the law relates to the 'kingdom of God' , but the age of grace relates to the 'kingdom of the heavens'
When the Lord was on earth, He sent out the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the Jews , but the disciples were rejected
Some of us act foolishly, and some of us act prudently, but we all bear responsibility for our living and actions
Oil refers to the Holy Spirit, and we all have a lamp, that is, a spirit, for this oil, and as virgins we all have oil in our lamps
The vessels of the prudent virgins are also filled with oil, referring to the Holy Spirit filling our soul as the vessel of our personality
Every regenerated believer has the regenerating Spirit, but not all have been filled with the Spirit to be mature in life
The number of the majority of the believers who are dead is ten, and the number of the believers who are alive is two
When the Lord comes, two of the twelve will be living and working, and ten of the twelve will be sleeping in death
When the Lord comes, an angel will blow a trumpet, and the dead believers will rise from the dead to meet the Lord
They can only go away in order to pay the price and be filled with the Holy Spirit to mature in life and be ready to meet the Lord
The believers who are filled with the Holy Spirit, matured in life, and ready will be raptured to attend the wedding feast with the Lord
Those who are not ready, who have gone away to prepare, will be left behind until the end of the great tribulation
They will be raptured later when they are ready, but by the time they are ready, the door to the wedding feast of the kingdom will be closed
The words not know you do not mean that the Lord does not know about them but that He does not approve of them
The Lord is not only our Bridegroom but also our Master, and to the Lord we are not only virgins but also slaves
The first parable emphasizes the filling of the Holy Spirit, and this parable emphasizes the gifts of the Holy Spirit
The one who received the smallest gift did not utilize his gift for the Lord and did not use it to help others to earn interest
All believers will be raptured to stand before the Lord's judgment seat to be judged , and each one will tell the Lord what he did
These verses are a small parable inserted into a clear word concerning how Christ will judge the nations living on earth when He returns
These nations are not the Jews nor do they include the Jews because the Bible says that the Jews do not reckon themselves among the nations
The nations in Matthew 25:32 also do not include those in the church because the church is chosen out from among the Gentiles, the nations
He will be the King of all the nations on earth, and He will sit on His throne of glory in Jerusalem, which is the throne of David
The Lord will judge the world in righteousness from His throne of glory , meaning He will judge the nations living on earth at that time
At that time the Lord will be the Judge of the dead, whereas in this judgment He will be the Judge of the living
The sheep are those who receive the eternal gospel and treat the believers well on earth during the great tribulation
Since these believers are the Lord's brothers, those who treat them well will be considered by the Lord to be righteous ones
The goats are those who do not receive the eternal gospel and mistreat the believers on earth during the great tribulation
These goats will immediately go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels to suffer an eternal punishment
Before the millennial kingdom they are cast into the lake of fire, after Antichrist and the false prophet have been
The righteous, the sheep, will enter into the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world
When believers are saved today, they are regenerated, and the eternal life enters into their being; they obtain eternal life
Today the eternal life is a life in and for the believers, but for the sheep in the future it will only be a realm
Just as eternal perdition will be a realm in which the goats will suffer, eternal life will be a realm in which the sheep will be happy
The sheep will not obtain eternal life or be part of the new creation; they will merely be restored to their original created condition
After seeing the above points we can understand an overview of the beginning and ending of the kingdom of the heavens and its process
He presented the kingdom of the heavens to the Jews and wanted them to pursue and receive it, but they rejected it
They live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, submit to the heavenly authority, and bring in the kingdom of the heavens
There are also many false believers and evil ones in the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, which is so-called Christianity
God sent apostles to the Gentiles to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens and to call them to enter into the kingdom
Although many have responded to His call and have been saved, the overcomers chosen to enter into the kingdom are few
At the end of the great tribulation these ones will be raptured, but they will be refused entrance into the kingdom feast
After all the believers are raptured, the Lord will establish His judgment seat in the air and settle accounts with the true believers
The millennial kingdom will begin, and the kingdom of the heavens will be completely and properly manifested upon earth
During the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers will reign with the Lord Jesus for one thousand years
Most believers today think that entering the kingdom of the heavens means to be saved, that is, to obtain eternal life
If one wants eternal life, he does not need to do anything but believe, because faith is the only requirement for obtaining eternal life
John says that we obtain eternal life by faith, and Matthew says that we must do God's will to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
Matthew repeatedly speaks of following Him, of taking up the cross to follow Him, and of leaving everything to follow Him
Matthew shows that we must faithfully follow the King of the kingdom of the heavens in order to enter the kingdom of the heavens
Eternal life is obtained by receiving the Lord through faith; the kingdom of the heavens is entered into by faithfully following the Lord
According to the Bible, we should realize that obtaining eternal life and entering the kingdom of the heavens are two different things
John 1:12 speaks of being children in the household of God, whereas 2 Timothy 2:12 speaks of reigning in God's kingdom
Being children is a matter of receiving eternal life; reigning as kings is a matter of entering the kingdom of the heavens
If we want to have eternal life and be children of God, we only need to receive the Lord by believing into Him
These two verses in the Bible also prove that obtaining eternal life and entering the kingdom of the heavens are two different matters
By grace you have been saved' ; compare with 'The crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me'
We only need to believe and receive in order to receive God's salvation; we do not need to do even the smallest work
Matthew 7:21 tells us we must do works that carry out the will of the Father in order to enter the kingdom of the heavens
In contrast Matthew 7:21 says that not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of the heavens
According to the verse in Matthew 7, a person who calls, 'Lord, Lord,' may not be able to enter the kingdom of the heavens
These two portions of the Bible also show that being eternally saved and entering the kingdom of the heavens are two different things
In Matthew 18:3, however, the Lord said that we must turn and become like little children in order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
Entering into the kingdom of God is a matter related to life, and entering into the kingdom of the heavens is a matter related to living
The kingdom of God is the whole realm of God's reign, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is a part of that realm
These two portions of the Bible prove that entering the kingdom of God is different from entering the kingdom of the heavens
According to the Bible, we can obtain eternal life in three different time periods: in this age, in the coming age, and in eternity
Saving the soul, finding the soul, possessing the soul, and keeping the soul all refer to the salvation of the soul
According to Mark 8:35-38 and Matthew 16:25-27, whether our soul has been saved will be determined at the Lord's return
In the coming millennial kingdom, we will lose our souls, that is, the enjoyment of our soul because of extreme suffering at that time
In 1 Corinthians 9:24, he says that all believers are like runners on a racecourse who must run in a specific way to win the prize
For the Lord to reward us with a crown means that He will give us the kingdom with the enjoyment of its glory as a prize
To be a priest is to serve God, to live before Him, to be filled and saturated with Him, and thus to be completely one with Him
Romans 8:17-23 shows that believers obtain the sonship in the future with the redemption of our body when we enter into glory
Hebrews 12 tells us that the church is God's firstborn and uses the example of Esau as a warning for us to not give up our birthright
If we love the world as Esau did, we will lose the birthright and not be able to enter into the kingdom to enjoy the blessings therein
If we indulge our lusts like Reuben, we will lose the church's birthright and not be able to enter into the kingdom
The Holy Spirit in Hebrews 3 and 4 compares the Israelites' entering into Canaan with the believers' entering into the coming kingdom
If we only have salvation but are not priests and kings to God, we have not experienced God's complete salvation
Despite the fact that we have received God's complete salvation, we have not yet fully enjoyed His complete salvation
Today we are enjoying a part of God's salvation, not all of it; we have not enjoyed the highest part of His salvation
Not until we enter the kingdom can we ascend to the highest peak of God's salvation and enjoy its highest part
If we enter the kingdom of the heavens we will enjoy all these things if we do not enter the kingdom of the heavens we will not enjoy them
If we enter the coming kingdom of the heavens, we will enjoy all these things and fully enjoy God's complete salvation
The kingdom of the heavens is divine, heavenly, and spiritual; it is also righteous, holy, full of authority, and according to law
If we would enter the kingdom of the heavens, we must not only repent in our heart but also produce fruit worthy of repentance
On the positive side it means that we must give ourselves to God to do His will obey His authority submit to His control and live for Him
A person who has repented in his heart must have outward fruit worthy of repentance in order to enter the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of the heavens is righteousness, and the kingdom is where God carries out His righteousness and exercises His authority
It is only by being persecuted for the sake of righteousness that we can participate in the righteous kingdom of God
Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens'
The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees is according to law and in outward actions; it is of the letter and weak
It is spiritual and living, and it surpasses the requirements of the letter of the law to match God's divine nature
The Lord Jesus said that if we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens our righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees
Both of these verses refer to the surpassing righteousness that is a condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens
Not everyone who says to Me Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of the heavens but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens
In order to diligently take care of God's will, we must put ourselves aside and deny our interests and desires
Matthew 5:3, 10, 20, and 7:21 are not the only portions that speak of conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens
The Lord's entire speaking on the mountain in Matthew 5-7 presents conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens
These preceding points are requirements for entering the kingdom of the heavens because they are the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
Living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a condition for entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Only those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Only those who are selfless and conquer their fleshly temper today will rule the nations in the kingdom of the heavens in the future
The Bible speaks of the kingdom of the heavens being ours today; it does not speak of it as being only in the future
If we are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, we will enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future
Living in the kingdom of the heavens today is a condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens in the future
God's opponent Satan uses many methods to frighten or frustrate people so that they cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens
All the things of the kingdom of the heavens are absolutely different from our thoughts, desires, and pursuits
If we want to enter the kingdom of the heavens, we must deny ourselves, take up our cross, lose our soul-life, and follow the Lord
We must pass through this narrow way before we can enter into the kingdom of the heavens and arrive at the throne
He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens'
Only those who are ready when the Lord comes will be able to enter with Him into the kingdom to attend the wedding feast
To be watchful means that we are vigilant because we do not know when the Lord will come or when we will meet Him
Those who are not faithful and prudent today will not be qualified to enter the kingdom of the heavens to rule over the world in the future
Anyone who is unwilling to give up the world and is constantly looking behind to the world is not worthy to enter the kingdom of God
Rather, we must buffet our body and make it our slave; we should not be loose in any way or indulge in the slightest lust
How we work today is absolutely related to receiving the reward of entering the kingdom of the heavens in the future
Our work today must be of gold, silver, and precious stones in order for us to receive the reward of entering the kingdom of the heavens
It is not a work of wood, grass, and stubble, which is out of man, of the flesh, and full of the earthly element and condition
Despite the fact that we have not yet obtained the resurrection of our body that is a resurrected body we have the Lords resurrection life
We have obtained the Lord's resurrection life, and we can live each day by this resurrection life and be delivered from our natural life
We must live in this resurrection life, not in our natural life, so that we can inherit the kingdom of God in the future
We must have holy words and actions, and we must keep ourselves far from sin and filthiness in order to inherit the kingdom of the heavens
If we do these things today, we will certainly receive a crown as a reward when we enter the kingdom of the heavens
If we want to receive such a crown, we must pay the price; we must fight the good fight, finish the course, and keep the faith
If we love the Lord's appearing, we will be like John on the island of Patmos, who was for the Lord and said, 'Come, Lord Jesus'!
The Israelites could not enter into the rest of Canaan, which typifies the rest of the kingdom, because they did not believe
In this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you'
Prior to speaking of being richly and bountifully supplied, Peter speaks of being a partaker of the divine life and nature
If these things exist and abound in us, an entrance to the Lord's eternal kingdom will be bountifully supplied to us
If we want to enter into the kingdom of the Lord, the kingdom of the heavens, we must pursue the growth in life and have an abundant life
If we have righteousness toward ourselves, peace toward others, and joy toward God, we are partaking of God's kingdom
If we live in righteousness, peace, and joy today, we will enter into the kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy
A life of righteousness, peace, and joy, that is, an abundant life, is also a condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens
The Lord's call to these overcomers is included in the seven epistles that were sent to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3
The first call to the church in Ephesus deals with the cause of the church's degradation-leaving her first love toward the Lord
When the church loses her love toward the Lord and her testimony of the Lord, she does not provoke Satan's enmity or attack
If the church keeps her love for the Lord and is faithful to maintain the Lord's testimony, Satan will come in to harm and persecute her
We can be faithful unto death and overcome Satan's persecutions because we can live by Christ's resurrection life
If a plot to persecute the church does not succeed, he will change his plot to welcome the church with a smile
The church also received the teaching of the Nicolaitans, who subdued the laity and formed a clerical hierarchy
If the believers overcome in this instance, they will obtain the kingdom's authority and rule over the nations with the Lord
In such a dead and weak condition, the church cannot bring in the kingdom for the Lord, and she is even defiled in the Lord's eyes
To overcome in this instance requires us to exhaust our little power so that we can obtain a crown and enter into the kingdom of the heavens
There we will be pillars in the temple of our God and have God's name, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord's new name written on us
If we do not reject the Lord's name, then God's name, the name of God's city, and the Lord's new name will be written on us
When the church is in such a condition, she shuts the Lord outside, and the Lord is no longer able to use her to bring in the kingdom
Overcoming is necessary to bring in the Lord's kingdom; it is an essential condition for entering the kingdom of the heavens
Defeated believers who remain in the dark, evil world will not enter into the bright, righteous kingdom to reign
We need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, be restricted by the heavens, and submit to the heavenly authority
We need to endure sufferings, be ready and watchful, and be faithful and prudent in our testimony for the Lord
We should never think that everyone who is saved will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
We have the robe of justification the sealing ring sandals that separate us from the earth and the fattened calf as our enjoyment of life
These items are sufficient for us to be children in the house of God, but if we want to be kings in the kingdom of God, we must have crowns
Whether we will obtain a crown in the future and enter into the reward of the kingdom of the heavens is not certain
After seeing the conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens, we may feel that they are too high and too hard
Since the Lord has promised that God is well pleased to give us the kingdom, God must work on our behalf so that He can give us the kingdom
Although God is well pleased, whether or not we are well pleased to obtain it is a question that remains to be answered
If we seek first the kingdom of God, He will give us not only the kingdom but also all the things that are necessary for our living
Many brothers and sisters feel they should love the Lord, give their all to follow Him, and pursue the kingdom of the heavens
They think that if they love the Lord, give their all, follow Him, and pursue the kingdom, they will have no way to make a living
Luke 1113 which refers to the same promise says How much more will the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!
In contrast, Matthew 7:11 says, 'How much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him'!
According to the Lords promise if we are willing to ask seek and knock God will surely give us the kingdom which He regards as a good thing
God is willing to give us the kingdom; therefore, if we are willing to receive it from Him, we should ask Him for it
His power can meet all the requirements that His holiness and glory place on us for entering the kingdom of the heavens
In these verses the Lord said not only that entering the kingdom of the heavens is with difficulty but also that with men it is impossible
From our point of view, entering the kingdom of the heavens is only a difficult matter, but the Lord said that it is impossible
The first thing the Lord does for us is to show us that we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens by our own power
Even though the Lord said that entering the kingdom of the heavens is impossible with men, He does not stop there
Although Caleb and Joshua looked at their own inability, they also looked at God's ability and believed that He was able
We should not be disappointed when we see that we are not able, because that is the time for us to look to God and believe that He is able
Just as salvation is a matter of God's power, entering the kingdom of the heavens also is a matter of God's power
Just as salvation is accomplished for us by God, entering the kingdom of the heavens is also accomplished for us by Him
He died on the cross for us and resolved the problem of our sins; today He is living in us to resolve the problem of our weakness
On the cross He was our Substitute for us to be saved; today He is in us as our power for us to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
Corinthians 1:30 tells us that God put us into Christ, but we still need the Lord to open our eyes to see this glorious fact
It is easy to live out the conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens because we are empowered in Christ
It is useless for us to lean on Him with our strength; instead, our conquering comes through His conquering in us
When our experiences are through Him, we will conquer in all things, and we not merely conquer but more than conquer
All the requirements, the conditions, for entering the kingdom of the heavens truly speak of God's ability and of what we can do in Him
We need God to open our eyes to see that He has placed requirements upon us so that He can fulfill them in us through His strength
On the one hand, He is outside of us making requirements of us, but on the other hand, He is in us fulfilling these requirements for us
He is the One requiring, and He is the One fulfilling; He is the One commanding, and He is the One keeping the commandments
Similarly, God's salvation today not only redeems us but also takes us through the way of the cross and brings us into the kingdom
Rather, we are constantly saved by the Lord in His salvation to take the way of the cross and to enter the kingdom of the heavens
The Lord in His great salvation constantly brings us along in the way of the cross until He brings us into the kingdom of the heavens
When we go through Him, we are able to more than conquer and fulfill the conditions for entering the kingdom of the heavens
It is not something that is possible only when we feel the Lord's power but rather when we have no sense of His power at all
When we believe that the Lord will manifest His power in our weakness according to His Word we are able to more than conquer in these things
The New Testament also speaks about the blessings that the believers will receive when they enter the kingdom of the heavens in the future
We must clearly see that these blessings are related to the kingdom of the heavens, not to the household of God
When believers enter the kingdom of the heavens in the future, they will not be ordinary citizens; rather, they will reign with Christ
Christ and all the overcoming believers will be a corporate king with Christ as the Head to rule the coming earth
A crown is the symbol of a king, so obtaining a crown is related to the first blessing of reigning as a king with Christ
Through this crown, He will show that He approves of what they have done, that everything they have done is pleasing and acceptable to Him
When the believers enter into the kingdom, they will not only rule the earth but also judge the inhabitants of the millennial age
When the overcomers enter the kingdom of the heavens to reign, their main function will be to exercise authority and rule over the nations
In the Old Testament the priests and kings were two different groups of people ; kings could not be priests, and priests could not be kings
Today those who are willing to give up the world for the Lord will inherit the earth with the Lord and obtain the earth as their inheritance
Another great blessing that the believers will obtain when they enter the kingdom of the heavens is being glorified with the Lord Jesus
The apostle Paul says that the afflictions we endure for the Lord today are not worthy of being regarded with the glory we will receive
The duration of the millennial kingdom is the Lord's wedding day , and the kingdom itself is the wedding feast of Christ
At that time the overcoming believers will be both the bride of Christ and the guests who are invited to the wedding feast
In the coming kingdom God will give this blessing to the overcomers and allow them to have an enjoyable foretaste of His eternal blessing
In the kingdom of the heavens the overcomers will enjoy the feast that God has prepared for them from eternity with the Lord
The manna in Exodus 16 is a type of Christ coming down from the heavens to be food for the enjoyment of God's people
The hidden manna is not open for everyone; rather, it is hidden for the overcomers, who have rejected the world
Not every saved one will obtain this blessing; it is only for the particular, special enjoyment of the overcomers
To keep us from being condemned with the world and to cause us to partake of His holiness, God comes in to discipline, teach, and punish us
All Bible readers and Bible scholars agree that the discipline referred to in 1 Corinthians 11:32 and Hebrews 12:9-10 occurs in this age
That slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes'
In these verses the Lord clearly said that when He comes, some of the slaves who serve Him will receive many lashes from Him
The Bible speaks of the Lord disciplining believers in this age, but it does not say that He disciplines them only in this age
It is not wrong to say that the Lord judges the believers today , but when He returns, He will judge them even more
Today His judgments are fragmentary, partial, and incomplete; when He returns, His judgment will be comprehensive, full, and complete
The millennial kingdom will be a time of restoration only ; it will still be related to the old heaven and the old earth
These former things will not pass away until the time of the new heaven and new earth, when God makes all things new
God will have His full enjoyment only in the new creation-in the new heaven and new earth-after His judgment is completed
Consequently, He will continue His work of judging, disciplining, and dealing with the believers in the millennial kingdom
Some believers are disciplined and dealt with by the Lord today; some will not be disciplined and dealt with until He comes in the future
Will their death free them from their responsibilities concerning sinning, loving the world, and not loving the Lord?
Whether we look at it from the angle of reasonableness or from an angle of necessity, there will be discipline in the future
In any case, the Lord's Word clearly tells us that in the future some believers will be disciplined by the Lord
If our actions are pleasing and acceptable to Him, He will give us a reward; if they are not pleasing and acceptable, He will chastise us
If we have done good things, we will receive a reward, and if we have done bad things, we will receive punishment
According to the two preceding verses, some believers will receive a reward when the Lord returns, and some will receive punishment
We have seen that the Lord's teachings on the mountain in Matthew 5-7 speak of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
We know they are saved because they call Him their Lord , and they serve the Lord and do good works in His name
Although they worked in the Lord's name, they did not do God's will; instead, they acted contrary to God's will
If some students study after ten, they are breaking the school rules, even though they may be doing something beneficial
The coming kingdom of the heavens will be given to those who were willing to give up the enjoyment of their soul in this age
Those who cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens will not enjoy its glory and happiness; instead, they will suffer shame and loss
Some believers are unwilling to forsake everything and instead lust after worldly enjoyment, so they lose their salty flavor as Christians
Although they may not sin, they lose their heavenly flavor as Christians, and they lose their separation from the world
Although they are Christians, they do not have the flavor of a Christian, nor can they fulfill the function of a Christian
Outside refers to a place outside the glory of the coming kingdom of the heavens but different from the manure pile
In these verses the Lord spoke of those who have received His gift but do not faithfully and diligently use it to work for Him
If one does not abide in Me he is cast out as a branch and is dried up and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
The Bible clearly and assuredly tells us that salvation and the obtaining of eternal life are by faith alone and nothing more
In their eyes eternal perdition is the only problem, and they think that as long as they are saved, they have no worries
Brothers and sisters, this word is so clear: 'He will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire'
The reward that believers will receive is an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens; this should stir up our appreciation
In contrast, the punishment that some believers will receive will be like passing through fire; this should stir up our fear
He quickly answered that he would choose to be thrown into the darkness because he thought it was a lesser punishment
The other elderly brother then said, 'That is not really passing through fire because it says 'so as through fire'
Will we receive the reward of the kingdom of the heavens or will we suffer loss that is like passing through fire?
Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation
We have seen that the blessings that the Lord promised to the overcomers in His seven epistles would be in the coming kingdom
Since this is the case, the Lord's warnings to the believers in these epistles must also speak of punishments during the kingdom age
Conversely, if believers do not overcome, if they are afraid to die for the Lord and are defeated, they will be hurt of the second death
They will not receive the second death; however, they will be hurt of the second death, which is related to the lake of fire
The Lord's servants, who are saved ones, will receive such a punishment if they are afraid to die for the Lord
It refers to some kind of punishment that the Lord will give to those believers who are afraid of being martyred for Him
Since they are saved, they are eternally saved and will not perish for being weak, fading, or stained with death
Matthew 12:32 says that there is a sin that 'will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come'
Matthew 18:34-35 shows that a brother who is unwilling to forgive another brother today will receive punishment in the kingdom age
These portions of the Bible clearly show that when saved ones commit sins, they will be judged and punished with fire
Hebrews speaks of God's New Testament salvation, and every section of this book gives us an important word with a serious warning
Rather, it refers to believers who will be condemned and punished for neglecting God's great salvation, which they had obtained
In the kingdom age God will punish any believer who has neglected His great salvation and who did not enjoy or apply it well
Let us fear therefore, lest, a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it
Those who fall behind because of unbelief and disobedience to God's word will not be able to enter the kingdom
We must be diligent to enter into the kingdom rest; we must pursue it diligently lest we fall behind and are unable to enter into it
If this is the case, we will receive a great punishment from God, and we will lose the highest blessing in God's salvation
According to Hebrews, Christ is a High Priest forever according to an eternal order , and He has the power of an indestructible life
In order to grow, we should not lay again the foundation of repentance since that foundation was laid when we were saved
The powers of the age to come refers to the power in the coming kingdom age to cast out demons, heal the sick, and work miracles
These powers will be used in the kingdom age to fully deal with anything that is related to demons, sickness, and suffering
If a person who has these qualifications is not saved, what qualifications must one have in order to be saved?
To say that a believer can perish because he falls after his salvation goes against the basic truths of the Bible
The fourth warning, in 10:19-39, is given to warn us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to not shrink back to Judaism
In this new covenant we also have God's law of life in us which enables us to know God without anyone teaching us
Although they were under the new covenant they still kept the ordinances of the old covenant so they were in the church but also in Judaism
In this situation, some Jewish believers naturally became weak and doubted whether or not they should completely reject Judaism
The apostle wrote this letter to bring those in Judaism out of that religion and to call them to stand absolutely in the new covenant
In 10:25 he exhorts the Jewish believers not to abandon their own assembling together, that is, not to abandon the Christian meetings
In the New Testament age there is no longer a sin offering made by killing bulls or goats, nor is there a need for such an offering
In such a condition, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire of the kind that consumes the adversaries
When they did this, they not only considered the Son of God and His blood to be common; they also insulted the Spirit of grace
They surely would receive a heavier punishment because the Lord will judge His people and have vengeance on them
Faith is the unique way to run the race , and in previous generations the saints who lived before God did so in faith
We should be in fear and trembling and should obey Him and do His will with piety and fear because our God is a consuming fire
At that time some believers will 'receive a reward,' and some will 'suffer loss'; some will be rewarded, and some will be punished
His future punishment does not affect the completeness of His salvation or prove that His salvation is incomplete
Hebrews 12:6-11 also speaks of the children of God being disciplined and punished by God for things related to unrighteousness
They think that any future discipline would affect the completeness of the Lord's salvation and prove that it is not complete
How can the Lord's chastisement of believers not affect His salvation today but affect His salvation in the future?
If the Lord's chastisement of the believers today does not affect His salvation, future punishment also will not affect it
In the same way, if the Lord chastises us in the future, it will be because of our failure to apply His salvation to a particular matter
In conclusion, the Lord will not punish us if we apply His salvation, but if we do not apply His salvation, He will punish us
Everything about us is under the Lord's condemnation, and the Lord will judge any matter that has not passed through His salvation
A sin that is unto death means we must die and cannot continue to live on the earth after we commit such a sin
After we receive the Lords redemption we must apply it every time we fall sin become stained or dirty or commit an offense before the Lord
If we have not allowed the Lord's blood to be efficacious with respect to all our sins, God will judge and punish us for these sins
If we do not take advantage of our time, we will offend God's governmental administration and receive punishment
If we do not apply the Lord's salvation, we will not be in accord with God's governmental administration, and we will receive discipline
At the beginning of the New Testament age God placed the kingdom of the heavens before His people so that they would pursue it
He also considers the kingdom of the heavens to be a reward for those who care for His heart's desire and do His will today
He has made provision for the kingdom of the heavens in order to encourage the believers and to manifest His righteousness
When Paul was about to leave this world, he charged Timothy, his spiritual son, by the Lord's appearing and by His kingdom
The Lord's appearing-His return-and His kingdom-the kingdom of the heavens-are serious tests for the believers
He was under the warning and hope of the kingdom of the heavens as he followed the Lord throughout the course of his life
Believers often regard the Lord's return as a matter of comfort and hope, but they do not regard it as a warning or a test
When the Lord comes, He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts
When the Lord comes, His reward will be rendered according to the true nature of each one's work, that is, as his work is
We must remember the word in Revelation 1 and the situation when the Lord appeared to John on the island of Patmos
When he was young, John reclined peacefully on the Lord's bosom , but when he saw the Lord in Revelation, he 'fell at His feet as dead'
If the believers see the terribleness of the Lords chastisement in the kingdom of the heavens who would not turn to pursue the Lords kingdom
We often say that unbelievers are living in a drunken stupor and in their dreams, with no worry about tomorrow
We hope that these brothers would not just be concerned about doctrinal arguments but also care for the practical questions
If we want to avoid the discipline of the kingdom of the heavens, we must pursue the reward of the kingdom of the heavens
The discipline of the kingdom of the heavens should warn us, and the reward of the kingdom of the heavens should encourage us
Many brothers and sisters are still loose in their living and actions after being saved; they do not care for the Lord's glory or pleasure
In 2 Corinthians 5:14 the apostle speaks of 'the love of Christ,' but he also speaks of 'the fear of the Lord' in verse 11
If we have received His love but do not live for Him, His fearfulness should serve as a warning and an encouragement to us
If we are unwilling to accept the constraining of His love, the fear of the Lord should encourage and warn us of our need to live for Him
While the Lord's love constrains many believers to live for Him, many believers still need a fear of the Lord to warn and encourage them
Those who cannot be moved by the accomplishment of His death should be warned and encouraged by His coming judgment
The apostle Paul spent his entire life running after the Lord because God's reward was an encouragement to him
Some parents set aside a certain time as a reward to encourage their children to be obedient and to study hard
Whoever is obedient and studies hard will get a reward and have a special time of enjoyment with their parents
Whoever does not obey and study hard will miss out on this time of enjoyment with the parents and will also receive some suffering
God's purpose for the kingdom of the heavens is not only to encourage the believers but also to manifest His righteousness
If His children sin, and He loosely passes over these sins, how can He judge the world according to righteousness?
God must manifest His righteousness with respect to His children before He can righteously condemn the worldly people
God uses the environment to judge and even discipline His children today , but this is only a partial judgment
God's full and complete judgment of His children will occur when the Lord returns, which is referred to in the phrase that day
During the kingdom of the heavens, God will manifest His righteousness with respect to His children by means of both reward and discipline
Although His heart is full of love toward His children, He cannot ignore His righteousness with respect to them
If He ignored His righteousness with respect to His children, how could He maintain His righteousness with respect to the worldly people?
He has set apart the kingdom of the heavens for the purpose of manifesting His righteousness among His children
The cross expresses His love for us eternity expresses His grace to us and the kingdom of the heavens expresses His righteousness toward us
What kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness, expecting and hastening the coming of the day of God'
When believers pursue the kingdom of the heavens, they not only can obtain the kingdom of the heavens, but they also can hasten its coming
The coming of the kingdom of the heavens requires people on earth to cooperate with God by fighting for the kingdom of the heavens
Revelation 12:10 shows that the kingdom of God comes because there is a group of overcomers in the church who overcome God's enemy, Satan
Satan still occupies the air and the earth today, and he works to prevent God's authority, His kingdom, from coming to the earth
In Matthew 6:10 the Lord asked us to pray for the kingdom of the heavens, and in verse 33, to seek the kingdom of the heavens
Heaven is not occupied by enemies, nor is there any warfare in heaven, but both of these matters were present in Canaan
When the believers enter the kingdom of the heavens, they will deal with Satan and his angels occupying this earth
The Israelites all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink just as we receive Christ and drink of the Holy Spirit
We must endeavor to pursue in order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens to fulfill God's highest will for us
Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible
He placed his whole being in a race for the kingdom of the heavens in order to gain the prize of the kingdom of the heavens
He ran in a specific way and boxed in a focused way in order to run well to obtain the crown of the kingdom of the heavens
Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you
He forgot all the former things and pressed ahead for the prizethe kingdom of the heavensto which God in Christ Jesus had called him upward
He earnestly pursued to enter the kingdom of the heavens, and he continued to pursue right up until the time he left this earth
He lost himself in the Lord to such a great extent that he could lose himself completely in Him in death without reservation
It was also his message to the companions whom he had to leave behind on the road to the kingdom of the heavens
Because of this opposition, we must be willing to carefully examine the question of the kingdom of the heavens before God
If this is the truth, the more it passes through the examination of opposition, the more it will be manifested as the truth
While a proper explanation concerning this truth is necessary, such an explanation is not for the purpose of arguing
We also realized that releasing this truth again would make it difficult to avoid even more and even stronger opposition
Some say that because we teach the discipline of the kingdom of the heavens, we are teaching concerning purgatory
Some who oppose the truth about the kingdom of the heavens say that the kingdom of the heavens is for the Jews, not for the church
In particular, they say that the teachings about the kingdom of the heavens in the Gospel of Matthew are for Jews, not for us believers
The same parable that refers to the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 13:31 is used to refer to the kingdom of God in Mark 4:30-32
The mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 13:11 are referred to as the mysteries of the kingdom of God in Luke 8:10
All the teachings concerning the kingdom of the heavens in the Bible are for the believers, and we should pay attention to all of them
We hope that all God's children would seriously investigate this matter according to His Word and be like the Bereans
If this is God's truth, we hope that our brothers will receive it; if it is shown to be a human speaking, we will gladly set it aside
We also ask the brothers and sisters who have received this truth to not debate with others simply because they understand this matter
We should use the truth to help others in the matter of life; we should not use the truth to debate with others about doctrines
If we help others to grow in life and to receive the truths that help them to grow in life, this is sufficient
The garden of Eden was warm, but after the fall there was a cool breeze, indicating that man was no longer in harmony with God
Following the curse, man had to toil all the days of his life and eat bread by the sweat of his face in order to survive
The initially peaceful and joyous earth became a place of suffering a place full of disasters accidents distress sickness pain and death
Because of the fall of man, all creation is under vanity and the slavery of corruption, and it is groaning and travailing
Today man tries to use all kinds of knowledge to improve human life, but man is still born crying and still dies crying
As the representative of all creation before God, man brought all of creation into conflict with God through the fall
Those who submit to God's authority and who are at peace with God have the possibility of a foretaste of this condition
Over the centuries, some have not been touched by the dangers in creation brought about by the conflict between God and man
Even though, as believers, we are called out of fallen humanity, we still live on the earth and suffer from the consequences of its chaos
When we as believers live for God in this world and testify for Him Satan uses all kinds of people events and things to cause us to suffer
God takes no pleasure in the painful sufferings that His discipline may involve, but He is our Father, and He knows our condition and need
Regardless of our condition, we all need God's discipline, and so for our benefit, God disciplines us as He sees fit
Since God pays attention to such small matters, how could anything happen to us without God's permission and arrangement?
Sufferings bring many kinds of blessings to the believers because God uses sufferings not only to discipline us but also to perfect us
When we hear a spiritual message and receive some light concerning spiritual matters, it may seem that we have obtained these things
When we pass through trials, these things are constituted into us, and they strengthen us and become solidified in our being
Similarly, the teachings that we have received can be strengthened and solidified in our being when we pass through trials
The Lord's word in Matthew 13:21 concerning passing through trials after hearing the word refers to this process
If we are not stumbled by the trials that come after hearing the word, the word will become something solid in us
The proving of our faith through sufferings is much more precious than the proving of gold that passes through fire
Endurance is not something that we have naturally; it comes from the proving of our faith associated with our passing through sufferings
In order for our faith to be enduring and long-suffering, it must be proved; that is, it must pass through sufferings
Although we have been saved and have become God's people, we still indulge ourselves according to our own will
Sufferings experientially teach us God's statutes so that we can be governed by these statutes instead of by our looseness and lawlessness
God gives us the bread of adversity to eat and the water of oppression to drink so that we would be taught through our sufferings
When they experience sufferings, they immediately receive God's Word, accepting its teachings and the Lord's leading
Many times when worldly people sin, God seemingly ignores it, but when believers commit the same sin, God immediately deals with it
Sufferings enable people to cease from sin, to no longer follow the lusts of men, and to live in the will of God
After man fell, God ordained that he would suffer, because sufferings can impose harsh restraints upon men so that they would cease from sin
If there were no sufferings in the human life, a person could live his entire life in the pursuit of his own enjoyment and pleasure
If we never shed tears for the Lord, we can never experience the precious comfort that comes from His wiping away our tears
That we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God'
To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
Sufferings cause us to practically experience the Lord's death, and they also cause the Lord's life to be manifested in our mortal flesh
Sufferings work with all things for our good, and according to the next verse, this good is our conformation to the image of God's Son
It is only through tribulation and anguish that we truly come to know that we cannot be separated from the love of Christ
No one who suffers for the Lord suffers in vain; all who suffer for Him will receive a reward for their sufferings
We must pass through these troubles with the Lord before we can enter the kingdom of the heavens and obtain the kingdom
We should not forsake righteousness because we are afraid to suffer; we should not fail to keep Christ's testimony because we are ashamed
We must pray; only then can we be enlightened concerning the meaning of our suffering, and only then will our suffering be of benefit to us
God is faithful, who will not allow that you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out'
When we are suffering, we should believe that the Lord will surely make a way out for us and enable us to endure the sufferings
When we suffer, we should rejoice and exult; we should count it all joy because our sufferings are beneficial to us
God will not listen to any prayers that ask for sufferings, but the devil will hear and answer them with more of his malicious acts
We should resist anything that God does not allow and ask God to save us from the sufferings imposed by the devil
Although these days are related to one another in the Bible they are two different days just as the law and grace are two different matters
We need to look at some important portions of the Scriptures concerning the Sabbath, which can be divided into eleven categories
On the seventh day God finished His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done
In His rest and satisfaction He blessed this day and separated it from the other days, making it a special day, a sanctified day
God especially obtained rest and satisfaction on the seventh day because of the creation of man, who is at the center of His heart's desire
When God rested on the seventh day, He was not the only one who was resting; the man whom He created to express Him was resting as well
It was the first day for man, because after man was created on the sixth day, he immediately entered into rest on the Sabbath day
The principle of the law is that man must first work before he can rest; the principle of grace is that man needs to rest before he can work
Before God gave the law at Mount Sinai, Moses spoke concerning the Israelites' keeping the Sabbath rest in the wilderness
There were at least seven points concerning the Sabbath that God wanted His people, the Israelites, to keep during the age of the law
For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day'
Although the Israelites were fallen and under the law God did not want them to forget the rest that He had provided for them in His creation
By requiring the Israelites to keep the Sabbath, He reminded them that He created all things to enable man to rest with Him
You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God brought you out from there
Requiring the Israelites to keep the Sabbath, therefore, demonstrated and testified that He is the God of salvation and rest
The people of the ancient world no doubt had special days but they did not keep Gods Sabbath this proves that they did not belong to God
According to the principle of grace, as seen in the original Sabbath rest of creation, man obtained rest without working
According to the principle of works, as signified by the Sabbath under the law, man could not obtain rest without working
God wanted the Israelites to keep the Sabbath so that they would have an actual day of rest once every seven days
Larger tasks like collecting firewood pressing wine carrying burdens moving things and buying and selling products also were not permitted
Just as man could not keep the law in order to be justified, he could not keep the Sabbath in order to obtain rest
The moral aspects of the law were contained in statutes concerning how to act, how to deal with God, and how to treat others
The ritual aspects of the law were contained in ordinances concerning how to worship, how to offer sacrifices, and how to keep the feasts
All the items of ritual law are types of New Testament realities; they were all shadows of things to come in Christ
In His humanity the Lord Jesus was a perfect Israelite when He was on the earth, so He kept God's laws and ordinances in the Old Testament
As the Author of the new covenant, He had to terminate the things in the old covenant in order to establish the new covenant
What the Lord said and did in this instance was somewhat different from what the law said about keeping the Sabbath
According to the law, no work could be done on that day, but the Lord said that it was lawful to do well on the Sabbath
Those who had sick and dying relatives could not visit them on the Sabbath if they lived more than a Sabbath day's journey away
When the Lord was on the earth, He defined the Sabbath by saying that the Sabbath came into being for man, not man for the Sabbath
He was bringing them out of the principle of law, which was added alongside , and back to the principle of grace, which was in the beginning
Since the Lord was turning the age from law to grace, He dealt with people according to grace rather than according to law
As the Lord was passing through a grain field on a Sabbath day, His disciples plucked ears of wheat and ate them
He is the God who is greater than the temple the God who desires mercy and not sacrifice and the Lord who originally established the Sabbath
From that time, man was required to toil all the days of his life , live by the sweat of his face , and groan and travail
The Father was still working, and as the Son, He also was working to complete the work of redemption on the cross
In this instance the apostles did not enter a synagogue but went to a place of prayer by the river on the Sabbath
They went to a place of prayer because they wanted to seize the opportunity to speak to the people who were gathered to seek God
According to his custom Paul went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures'
Paul went into a synagogue on three consecutive Sabbaths and reasoned with the people there 'according to his custom'
His custom was not to keep the Sabbath but to go to a place where he could preach to the Jews who were gathered
Such things as eating, drinking, feasts, and the Sabbath were a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ
To observe matters like days and feasts is to keep the Old Testament ordinances, which only typify New Testament matters concerning Christ
According to the apostles teaching believers should not dispute concerning the keeping of days and believers do not need to keep the Sabbath
Seventh-day Adventists do not practice according to the Bible when they say that New Testament believers should keep the Sabbath
Their teaching that believers must keep the Sabbath day is not reasonable, and it is not according to the teaching of the Bible
These words show that with the restoration of the Israelites, the people on earth during the millennial kingdom will keep the Sabbath
When the new heavens and new earth are brought in, the people on the new earth, who are referred to as flesh, will keep the Sabbath
Today believers must pay attention to the matter of receiving and enjoying Christ, not to the matter of keeping the Sabbath
Since He is the God-given rest, whoever comes to Him and receives Him, regardless of the burden, will obtain rest
It typifies Christ as man's rest, and it symbolizes the rest in the kingdom of the heavens in the millennial kingdom
The rest that remains for the people of God is the rest in the kingdom of the heavens in the millennial kingdom
Everything in the kingdom of the heavens will be joyous, and those in the kingdom of the heavens will be satisfied
In the kingdom of the heavens there will be a glorious freedom that is the exact opposite of our groaning and travailing today
The overcoming believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will enjoy this rest together with Christ
The blessings they receive from God are earthly; therefore, God wants them to signify this through their keeping of the Sabbath
One group as numerous as the stars in the heavens would be heavenly the other group as numerous as the sand on the earth would be earthly
God deals differently with people in every age, and the ordinances that God wants people in each age to keep are also different
They have taken a day that God wants His earthly people to keep and have given it to His heavenly people to keep as well
The first day of the week in the New Testament is called the Lord's Day because it is the day of the Lord's resurrection
The Lord's Day in the New Testament does not come at the end of the week; rather, the Lord's Day comes at the beginning
The Lord's Day does not follow Monday through Saturday; instead, Monday through Saturday follow the Lord's Day
The Lord's Day does not follow or belong to the preceding six days; rather, the six days that follow the Lord's Day belong to it
When making announcements the brothers often refer to the days following the Lords Day as occurring next week instead of saying This week
If we use days to signify this, we would say that God brings us into the first day of the week and then sends us out for the other six
God's Sabbath rest of creation was the first day for man, and it spoke forth God's original intention to deal with man according to grace
Knowing this, God began to work after man's fall and continued until the Lord said on the cross, 'It is finished'!
Man can now rely on God's accomplished redemption in order to live for the next six days, that is, for the rest of his life
The principle of grace is that we would live for six days based on what we obtained the first day; this is a living in resurrection
In this living, we first rest and then work, we first obtain and then apply what we have obtained, and we first enter in and then walk
On the first day of the week, the disciples were meeting after the Lord's death and resurrection, and the Lord appeared to them
It signifies that the old creation has passed away and that His resurrection is the beginning of the new creation
Suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
The Holy Spirit of life was received on the day of the Lord's resurrection; the Holy Spirit of power descended on the day of Pentecost
The day of the Lord's resurrection was the first day of the week, and the day of Pentecost was also the first day of the week
On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered'
Just as the New Testament saints break bread in resurrection, they should also give their offerings in resurrection
If we give offerings in the old creation we cannot please God we must give our offerings in resurrection in order for them to be acceptable
In the Old Testament the Sabbath was the seventh day of the week, so the day after the Sabbath was the first day of the week
You shall count fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a new meal offering to Jehovah'
According to Leviticus, the Feast of Pentecost occurred on the day after the seventh Sabbath, which is also the first day of the eighth week
In the Old Testament the Israelites began the count of fifty days on the first day of the week when they offered up the firstfruits
The church is a kind of firstfruits and the day of Pentecost is fifty days after that first day of the week on which Christ was resurrected
Because the Lord's Day, or the eighth day, in the New Testament is the day of the Lord's resurrection, it signifies a new beginning
The Sabbath day on the seventh day in the Old Testament was a day of the old creation, signifying the natural man
If New Testament believers still keep the Sabbath of the seventh day, they are keeping a day of the old creation
We are people of the new creation, so we cannot keep a day of the old creation; rather, we must keep the day of the new creation
Through these types He signifies we should put off the old creation and do these things in the resurrected new creation
If this were the case, then being in spirit, which John also spoke of, would only be for the day of the Lord's coming
The Lord's Day must refer to the first day of the week, the day of the Lord's resurrection, the day on which the saints gathered together
Sometimes on the Lord's Day a store will display a sign, saying, 'We are resting today because it is the Sabbath'
There should also be ministry of the Lord's Word on the Lord's Day; there should be preaching of the Word to the believers
On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered'
When His people worship and thank Him, the Lord wants them to also make an offering to Him in response to His grace
Besides wanting us to meet on the Lord's Day to break bread and to give our offerings, there is nothing else He wants us to do
We should not keep the Lord's Day according to the dead letter of the law; instead, we should live the Lord's Day according to grace
