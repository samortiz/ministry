<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP A HABIT<br />
OF SPEAKING THE WORD OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:16; 1 Tim. 6:20</h1>
<p>In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we have to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord. For the most part, we do not have the practice or the habit of speaking the word of the Lord properly. We do not practice applying the word of the Lord to our daily life that much, nor have we built up the habit of exercising to speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs. For us to be saints who meet properly according to the holy Word, we need to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord in our daily life and in our daily affairs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE WORD OF THE LORD TO OUR DAILY LIFE<br />
AND AVOIDING PROFANE, VAIN TALK</h2>
<p>We must have a daily life that is filled with the speaking of the holy word. The normal daily human life is a speaking life, a talking life. It is hard to exist without speaking. It is difficult for people to be with others for even a short time without speaking. If you are with another person for only ten minutes without speaking a word, you must be a very strong-willed person. However, once we were saved by the Lord, we may have felt that it was very difficult to speak the word of the Lord to others. It is easy to speak the profane and vain word, but it is not so easy to speak the holy word. In 1 Timothy 6:20, Paul charged his young co-worker to turn away from &ldquo;profane, vain babblings.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;babblings&rdquo; indicates that it is very easy to speak profane, vain words. To babble is spontaneous and easy, but to speak the holy word is an exercise.</p>
<p>The only way to speak the holy word is to live according to the Spirit. If we want to speak the word, we must exercise to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, to do things according to the Spirit. We always have someone with whom we can speak. The husband and wife have each other, the parents have their children, and the students have their classmates. We all have the way and the time to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to others.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people have a lot of time to speak profane, vain words to others. Many would say that they do not have the time to pray, but they have a lot of time to talk on the telephone. When we do pray, we may pray only for a short time. But when we get on the telephone, we may talk for a long time. The reason for this is that our natural man has a lust for speaking natural things. There is a lust in our flesh for speaking profane, vain words to others. We must hate this lust, and we must do our best by the Spirit to put this lust on the cross. We have to turn from our lust to our spirit to live, to walk, and to have our being by the Spirit. We must hate our lust and crucify our lust by exercising our spirit. When we turn away from the lust that desires to talk in a vain way and turn to our spirit, our spirit will direct us to prayer. When we practice this, we are overcomers. This exercise will help us to practice speaking the word in our daily life.</p>
<p>In all the daily affairs of our daily life, we need to learn to speak the word. While we are doing things in our daily life, we need to learn to speak with others. Sometimes we may not have anyone with us. When there are no people to speak to, we can speak to the things around us. We can speak to the chairs, the flowers, the trees, and the animals. We should not stop speaking. Whether someone is with us or not, we should speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. When the sisters are cooking and no one is with them, they can talk to the oven about the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Always learn to talk in your daily life, but do not talk in a profane and vain way for your lustful enjoyment. You must change your habit to that of speaking the word of the Lord. If you want someone to accompany you when you go somewhere, get the right person to whom you can speak God&rsquo;s word. If you get the wrong person, you will not be able to build up the habit of speaking the divine things. You will be swallowed up by this wrong person. He will help you to speak things that are not so holy, and you will fall into profane and worldly talk.</p>
<p>If we do not speak properly during the day, when we come to the meetings in the evening, we will be the wrong persons. If we have been talking in a worldly way all day long and we come to the meeting in the evening, it is hard to make a &ldquo;U-turn.&rdquo; If our tongue is used to speaking worldly things for six days, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day our tongue will not cooperate with us to speak the holy word. If we are used to speaking worldly things during the week, how can we speak holy things in the meeting? Our speaking of the word in the meeting depends upon our habit. If I speak the holy word from Monday through Saturday, my tongue is used to that. Then when I come to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, everything within my being, my mind, will, and emotion, is used to the speaking of the holy word. This is what I mean by applying the word of the Lord to our daily life.</p>
<p>If we do not practice speaking the word in our daily life, it will be very hard for us to speak much in the meetings, and we will need some to be our clergy to speak for us. Suppose that fifty saints are meeting together and forty-eight of them are silent. This will create a big gap in which the other two will be tempted to speak for them. These two will think that if they do not speak, the meeting will be very poor. Spontaneously they could become the pastors of this group of saints. To build up a meeting according to the biblical revelation is not an easy thing. It is like climbing up a high mountain. To roll down a hill is easy. If we give in to our habit of not speaking, our meeting will roll down to the bottom of the hill. To have a high meeting, we must pick up a habit of speaking the holy word.</p>
<p>When we speak the holy word, we should not only choose our favorite verses to speak. We can use any verse. We can speak the first verse in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. If we only practice speaking our favorite verses, this can spoil us. It is good if we learn to speak the hardest verses, such as the first seventeen verses in Matthew 1. If we speak verses such as these again and again, this will help us build up a strong habit of speaking the word. If we speak two verses a day, we can speak Matthew 1:1-17 in eight and a half days. To play certain sports such as basketball or tennis requires much practice. We need to practice speaking the word until we become proficient.</p>
<p>The Lord has the desire to recover the way of meeting revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. Without this kind of meeting, the Lord has no way to build up His Body. In the past history of the church, very little building of the Body took place because the way of meeting was not the scriptural, building-up way. The old, traditional way of meeting kills, annuls, and unconsciously tears down the Body of Christ. We may have received some help from this kind of meeting, but there was very little building. To have all the members of the Body fitted and knit together is to be built up (Eph. 4:16). After nearly two thousand years of church history, the Lord cannot see a builded church as His living Body on the earth today. The unique way for the Lord to accomplish this building is for us to meet according to His ordained way, not with a definite speaker or with dead speakings, but with the living members who always practice the living speaking. Whenever these living members come together, they do not necessarily need to choose a subject on which to speak. If they all speak, there will be something of the Lord in every speaking and all the attendants will receive the benefit and will be built up.</p>
<p>Whether or not the scriptural meeting which we desire to have is prevailing in the coming days depends upon our speaking. If all of us can build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord, our meetings will be a full success. Our speaking will make our meetings so convincing, nourishing, life-giving, and even subduing. Then our meeting will become an attraction and a source of rich supply. If all of us practice to speak, we will not need to rely on inviting a good speaker to help us. If someone speaks to us occasionally, that might be good. But if we practice having a definite speaker in our meetings all year round, that practice in the long run will result in the killing of the members and the annulling of their organic functions. The practice of having a definite speaker tears down for the long run. If everyone speaks when we come together, this will subdue and surprise people. To build up such a practice may be hard at the beginning, but if we endeavor to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word honestly, faithfully, and even truthfully for one or two years, the proper habit of speaking will be built up, and we will see the success and fruitfulness of our endeavor.</p>
<p>I have discovered that it has been somewhat easy for us to raise up local churches for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At the beginning a few people are attracted to practice the church life, and within a short time the number of saints within a locality may increase to about fifty. At this point, however, a local church may find it hard to attract more people and the yearly percentage of increase may become quite low. The number of local churches on this earth has been increasing steadily, but at a certain point the increase within the churches comes nearly to a standstill. The basic factor that has stopped our attracting of others is that we took the way of a definite speaker. This is why some churches have remained in a place for at least fifteen years without much increase in number. At the beginning of the church life, we may be able to capture a good number of people, but eventually the practice of having a definite speaker kills the increase and annuls the functions of the members.</p>
<p>We must come back to the biblical way, to the recovery of the way of the proper meeting, and the proper meeting is to have all the attendants speaking. When all the saints speak&mdash; the weak and the strong, the old and the young&mdash;the result will be that people will be either nourished, subdued, convinced, or built up. Many positive results will issue from this practice. I encourage you all to practice speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word. We need to apply the word of the Lord to our daily life until we speak the word all the time.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of practicing to speak in our localities, we may become cold. To remain cold is easy, but to remain hot is not. At one time the water may be boiling, but if the fire is removed, it can become cold within a short time. Fire is needed to make the cold water hot, and this fire must be maintained to keep the water hot. I hope that the fellowship in this book can become a governing vision to us so that the fire within us to practice the scriptural way can be maintained. We need to allow the fellowship in this book to enter into us so that it becomes like an installed battery within our being to energize us to practice the new way.</p>
