<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><P>Verses 1-5: "You...be judged" is the opposite of "you judge." Here it does not say that "you...be judged by others" but simply "you...be judged." We know that this refers to being judged by God (1 Cor. 4:4). Judgment here is not the ordinary discerning judgment or the ordinary proper opinion. (1) We need to have a proper view toward others. The Lord said clearly that the Pharisees were hypocrites (Matt. 23:13), but He also said that He did not come to judge the world (John 12:47; 3:17). Paul said that the Corinthians were not spiritual but fleshy (1 Cor. 3:1), yet in chapter four he said, "Do not judge anything" (v. 5). (2) When a matter concerns a particular person, we should let him know. Judging is not only an attitude in our heart, but sometimes it is also expressed through our mouth. Whenever someone comes to us to ask about another person, we must first find out whether the asking one has any relationship with that person. If it is just for the sake of satisfying the itching ears, then it is not necessary to answer him. If it is because he is concerned about the spiritual condition, then it is all right to tell him. The Lord told the disciples to accept the teachings of the Pharisees, but not to imitate their behavior (Matt. 23:2-3). In his last book Paul wrote concerning Alexander (2 Tim. 4:14), Demas (v. 10), Phygelus, and Hermogenes (1:15) in order to help the recipient of his letter to guard against them.</P><P>Judging here includes the following two meanings: (1) judging as a judge and (2) being critical or faultfinding.</P><P>(1) Judging as a judge. The first mentioning in the Old Testament of this kind of judgment (see Exo. 18:13-27) shows that it is a judgment carried out by the rulers or officials. "Do not judge" means do not be a judge. Therefore, a Christian should not be a government official in politics. Once he becomes a government official, he can be neither merciful nor meek. Thus, he will lose two kinds of blessings. A Christian must not even once represent the law to judge others. The result of not judging others is "that you be not judged." This does not mean that anyone who is not an official judge will not be judged before the judgment seat of Christ. Here, to be judged is to be condemned.</P><P>(2) Being critical or faultfinding. Many types of behaviors are borderline behaviors. For instance, losing one's temper is permissible, but losing one's temper and committing sin are very close. If we are not careful, we will cross over the border; if we are careless, we will step into the realm of sin. The examples of the Lord and Paul show that we should speak frankly only when it is profitable to others. Otherwise, we should not speak, especially (1) if we have some bad intention, such as being jealous of others; (2) if it is because of our sin; or (3) if it is because we do not know ourselves. The more a person knows himself, the more lenient he is on others.</P><P>Verse 2: "For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you." This verse gives the reason for not judging others. There are two principles in the Bible; one is righteousness and the other is mercy. If you choose to treat people according to righteousness, your reputation, position, and wealth will not suffer loss. You can protect yourself with righteousness. However, the result will be that "with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you." James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy." If you choose the principle of mercy, which is the principle of overflowing mercy in Matthew 5, God will also measure to you with the measure of mercy. James 2:13 goes on to say, "Mercy triumphs over judgment."</P><P>Verse 3: "And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother's eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?" The preceding verses say that we should not judge; the Lord exhorted people with mercy. Here it tells us that it is improper for us to judge. The preceding verses are concerned with the result in the future; this verse deals with the condition today. Here it is not a matter of whether or not one has a beam in his eye; rather, he has it. If one says that there is a splinter in another's eye, it must be that he has a beam in his own eye. Since he judges that the other has a splinter in his eye, it must be that he himself has a beam in his own eye. If one can see a splinter, which is so tiny, one should be able even more to see a beam. (1) Since you can see the splinter in your brother's eye, this shows that you are quite an expert in sinning, that you are experienced in committing sin. Therefore, it is easy for you to see even a splinter. (2) It must be that you have an improper attitude toward God. Most of the time you see the splinter in your brother's eye because you have a beam in your own eye. The more sins we have, the more critical and faultfinding we are. Here the use of the word "brother" shows that the sermon on the mountain is spoken to Christians.</P><P>Verse 4: "Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the splinter from your eye, and behold, the beam is in your eye?" The preceding verse is regarding the observation of another's sin, whereas this verse is regarding the exhortation concerning another's sin.</P><P>Verse 5: "Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye." The Lord said it is good to remove the splinter from another's eye. However, one should remove the beam from one's own eye first and then remove the splinter from his brother's eye.</P>
