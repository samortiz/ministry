<p>Answer: Some enter immediately, and others enter gradually. For example, with the experience of salvation some can say that they were saved on a specific date, but others, mainly those who grew up in Christian families, become clear regarding their salvation gradually. Andrew Murray is an example of one who gradually became clear of our need to stop ourselves. Andrew Murray, in his book <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> repeatedly emphasizes that we must stop ourselves. Related to consecration, he does not say that we need to present something; rather, he uses the word <em>surrender</em> instead of <em>consecration.</em> This means that he was disarmed by Christ, defeated by Christ, and submitted himself to Christ.</p>
<p>This experience of Andrew Murray is correct. He mentions repeatedly our need to stop the activities of the flesh. When we truly have a vision of Christ, our entire being will be stopped, and we will see that Christ wants to live in us. Then we will no longer hope for patience and zeal. If we have seen that we can ride in a car, why would we want to ride a bicycle? Our entire being will be still when we see Christ; our zeal, patience, and humility will come to a halt, and we will completely surrender and submit ourselves to Him. We will say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Lord! You are the Lord of all, and all are Yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereas some see this immediately after they are saved, others see this gradually, beginning at the time of their salvation until they reach a certain point where they are thoroughly clear. From the autobiography of Andrew Murray, we know that he did not experience a sudden change. Even though he feared the Lord from his youth, he did not know on which day he was saved. He could only say that he realized he was saved and regenerated when he was in school. In <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> he does not clearly indicate on what day he saw that Christ lived in him. However, because he definitely saw that Christ lived in him, he could write this book; moreover, he already had a great deal of experience when he wrote the book.</p>
<p>We need to pursue having a heart for the Lord, a heart that loves Him, yet we should realize our pursuing and running are useless. This may sound contradictory. If our pursuing is useless, should we not stop pursuing? No, we must still pursue. On the one hand, we must pursue, but on the other hand, we need to realize that our pursuing avails nothing. We need to look to the Lord for His mercy that we might see. We should not believe that our zeal, diligence, or heart for the Lord are useful. These may help us work for Christ, but they cannot help us live out Christ. For us to live out Christ, our entire being must be stopped; even our being <em>for</em> Christ must be stopped. We must stop our entire being before Christ.</p>
<p>There are two sisters mentioned in John 11, Mary and Martha. In Christianity there is not an accurate understanding regarding these two sisters. Mary was not merely &ldquo;quiet&rdquo;; rather, she was one who stopped herself. Even though many people may be quiet, they cannot stop themselves. Martha was very active and also could not stop herself. Some sisters are very active; they are typical &ldquo;Marthas.&rdquo; Other sisters are very quiet; they are seemingly typical &ldquo;Marys.&rdquo; However, it is possible that both groups of sisters are &ldquo;Marthas.&rdquo; Those who are quiet outwardly may not be still inwardly. In the meetings many sisters bow their heads and pray silently, but their blood cells are racing at top speed. Outwardly they are quiet, yet inwardly they cannot stop. In contrast, other sisters outwardly are running diligently, but their inner being is at rest. Hence, neither quietness nor activeness determines whether a sister is a Mary or a Martha. It is not a matter of whether one is quiet or active but of whether one has stopped himself.</p>
<p>Although saints everywhere are eager to attend revival meetings, we like to hold &ldquo;calm&rdquo; meetings. Our concept is radically different. I would be very concerned if someone has been stirred up by these messages or is very excited as a result of these meetings. This is because these messages are not to excite people but to cause them to stop themselves completely.</p>
<p>For over two hundred years, since the time of John Wesley and Count Zinzendorf, the churches on the European continent have taken the way of revival. In these two hundred years, many people have been raised up to do the work of revival. However, God also raised up a few who knew Him in a deep way. These ones repeatedly pointed out that the way of revival is not the best way for God to accomplish His purpose. The way of revival can bring people to salvation, but it cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s plan for the church. The way of revival can cause the church to increase in number, but it cannot cause the Body of Christ to increase in stature. For over fifty years we have been crying out to the saints who do the work of revival, saying, &ldquo;We admit that your work has rendered Christians some help, but it cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo; Even though most saints care for revivals, we cannot do this work. Today the churches of the Lord do not need a work of revival but a work of revelation. We must let the Lord come in to show all who have a heart for Him what He wants to accomplish in His eternal plan.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, he prayed that God would grant the saints a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, in order that we might know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, and know the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (cf. 1:17-19, 23). Such knowledge cannot be obtained by being stirred up; it requires the revelation of the Holy Spirit. We can hold a three-day conference twice a year in which the saints continually shout Hallelujah. What happens after they have been &ldquo;pumped up with air&rdquo; in this way? We need to know that the faster air is pumped in, the faster it will leak out. After being &ldquo;pumped up with air,&rdquo; some local churches are unable to continue carrying on their meetings; the work of revival always issues in this kind of result.</p>
<p>In mainland China a great number of people were saved through the revival work of John Sung, who is a perfect example of a revivalist. When John Sung conducted meetings, people would come and shout, &ldquo;The precious blood of Jesus washes my heart, washes my heart, changing my black heart into a white heart.&rdquo; After ten days of such a revival, John Sung would leave and everything would leak away. Then Wang Ming-tao would come, and again the people, including the elderly and the young, would sing, &ldquo;The precious blood of Jesus washes my heart, washes my heart, changing my black heart into a white heart.&rdquo; After Wang Ming-tao left, two months later the spirit would dry up and leak away, and the number of people attending meetings would also drop. Consequently, elders and pastors would meet to discuss the situation and then send a cable to invite Brother So-and-so from Canton. Once again, everyone would gather together to pray, to thank the Lord, and to praise Him. The church has been living a life of constant dependence upon revival meetings for the past two hundred years. This is like being addicted to morphine injections. The number of people in the church has increased, but the stature of Christ in the church has not increased.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves: What are we doing here in Taiwan? Are we doing a revival work? Or are we providing a way for Christ to increase His stature in the church? We should never despise the preaching of the gospel to lead men to salvation. However, we should bear in mind that we should not pay attention merely to the preaching of the gospel in order to bring people to salvation while neglecting their knowledge of Christ after their salvation. The preaching of the gospel is to find material; the bringing of people to the knowledge of Christ is to build up these materials. The extent to which the saints can be built up and edified in the church depends upon how much we know Christ inwardly. For this reason I am not surprised when people speak with me regarding the situation of the churches, because I expect this. If the saints do not have an adequate inward knowledge of Christ, what else can be done other than revival works? We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that some among us will be enlightened by this word.</p>
<p>May God grant His church a spirit of revelation that the eyes of many of the saints will be opened. Our intention is neither to cause those who do not have a heart for the Lord to have a heart, nor to cause those who have a heart for the Lord to be more fervent. Rather, our desire is that some among us will be shown mercy and be enlightened. We should not pay attention to revival; we should change revival to revelation. We need revelation. The serving saints in all the localities need to see God&rsquo;s plan and how Christ is life in them. We need to see that we are the problem and frustration to Christ. We need to prostrate ourselves, stop ourselves, fully yield ourselves to Christ, absolutely surrendering to Him and giving all of our rights and ground to Him. No virtue can replace Christ, not even our zeal, patience, humility, or kindness; only Christ Himself is Christ. It is obvious that evil is not Christ, but neither is good Christ; only Christ Himself is Christ. Although we still live out goodness, the life that Christ lives out through us surpasses our goodness. We need to see this. This is what the Lord wants to do today. We should not despise the preaching of the gospel, but we need to pay attention to this revelation. I hope that we will all see this, pay attention to this, and spread what we have seen.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Guidelines for the Lord's Table Meeting and the Pursuit in Life &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
