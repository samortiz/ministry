When we believe, we receive eternal life. Once we believe, 			we receive. There is no need to wait or to hope. Salvation is not something that happens after death, but is a present 		matter. Since believers are already saved (John 5:24), unbelievers are already condemned (John 3:18).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Can man know that he is saved?		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"May know" (1 John 5:13)</li>		<li>"Let it be known" (Acts 13:38-39)</li>		<li>"For we know" (2 Cor. 5:1)</li>		<li>"Knowing" (2 Cor. 5:6-8)</li>		<li>"Know" (2 Tim. 1:12)</li>		<li>"Know" (1 John 3:14)<br>		Every believer can know whether or not he has eternal life. Men often think, "We can only hope that we are saved, and 		we can only know if we are saved after we die or at the time of judgment." This is not the teaching of the Bible. The 		Bible teaches that a man can know whether or not he has eternal life in this age.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>How can a man know that he is saved?		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"These things" (1 John 5:13)</li>		<li>"The testimony of God" (1 John 5:9-11)</li>		<li>"My word" (John 5:24)<br>		We may not have known that we are already saved, but the Word of God, the Bible, says that we are already saved; 		therefore we are saved. The Bible also tells us that he who believes has eternal life, is justified, has peace, and is 		saved. We only need to ask ourselves whether or not we have believed into the Lord Jesus as our personal Savior. If we 		have not believed, we will perish. If we believe, we spontaneously are a person who has eternal life. "He who believes 		has eternal life" (John 6:47). When we believe, we have eternal life. We know that we have eternal life not because we 		think or we feel that we do, but because God tells us so. Since we are saved and have received God's grace, we should 		not continue in sin (Rom. 6:1-2).</li>		</ol></li>	</ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 02: The Word of the Cross &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
