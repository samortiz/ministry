Not to Our Profession</h2>
<p>We need to have a revolutionary change. If we continue in this way for another twenty years, our situation will worsen. In the past we led people to be saved and asked them to come to the meetings. On the surface, it seemed as though we were feeding and teaching them, but it was a lazy way. If we want to feed, take care of, and teach the new ones, we must learn and be equipped.</p>
<p>Someone once said to me, &ldquo;We will not succeed if we try to have our meetings in mutuality, because everyone is busy making a living in order to feed a family. People are exhausted after six days of working, so on the seventh day they want a good worship service. They like to go to a nice chapel with a good atmosphere and comfortable seats that are arranged nicely. They want someone who can sing, someone who can pray, someone who can read the Scriptures, and someone who can speak and minister a good message. Such a situation refreshes everyone. But instead of providing that kind of meeting, we want everyone to function. How can you expect a banker to give a message? A banker goes to a worship service for entertainment and relaxation, and he gives a lot of money, hoping that the chapel would be better equipped. It is better to have a music pastor and an assistant pastor. Then people will be pleased with the service.&rdquo; According to this person, my fellowship concerning the change of system will not work.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago a responsible brother in San Francisco said to me, &ldquo;This is an age of specialization, and students major in different fields. Therefore, in spiritual things some people should study to be pastors, and others should learn to preach the word, just as only some people become medical doctors. Since no one is capable of doing everything, how is it possible that you want everyone to speak in the meetings? This way will not work.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;The Bible says that each person should speak in the meetings. For our work we need to major in a particular field, but we cannot do that in our living. Is it possible for some to major in eating and for others to specialize in drinking? Who is saying that we have to major in speaking? Regardless of a person&rsquo;s profession, he needs to eat, to drink, and to speak. Likewise, as long as you are a believer, you have to speak whenever you meet in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our living is not divided into different fields. Everyone has to eat, to drink, to breathe, to wear clothes, and to speak. Our worship and our service are not a profession; they are our living. Meeting together is not our job as Christians. Meeting together is our living, and it is the expression of our living. Therefore, it cannot be considered a field of study.</p>
<p>One person speaking with the rest listening annuls the life functions of the believers. For this reason, when I went back to Taipei in 1984, I repented sincerely. I confessed that I have damaged everyone because it was I who brought such a practice from mainland China. Such a practice is not only in Taipei; even churches in the United States and in other places around the world have learned this way. I am the one who caused this harm. But I thank the Lord that now a saint who has been saved for only two months or even ten days can praise, testify, and speak for the Lord. The trainings that we have had in Taiwan since 1984 are teaching us to abandon all the old things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Building Up the Habit in Our Living</h2>
<p>The training charges the trainees to baptize a person in his home after leading him to believe in the Lord; they should not bring him to the church meeting in which one person speaks. We do not want a new one to be influenced negatively in the meetings. A new one who attends a Christian meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening will feel that it suits his natural human nature, and if the content is not bad, he will be deeply impressed. As a result, it will be difficult to change his concept later. Learning to speak English is a good example. If a person does not learn proper pronunciation from the beginning, it will be difficult to correct his pronunciation later. When he is accustomed to the wrong pronunciation, it will be impossible to correct him. Likewise, after a person is saved, we should meet in his home and teach him some basic lessons and life practices. After three to five months we can bring him to the church meetings. Many new ones do not like to attend the church meetings. They prefer to meet at home because everyone can speak. They like the new way of meeting.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate my point with a true story. Over thirty years ago I set up a workers&rsquo; home in Taipei with forty-eight beds. The new full-time serving ones stayed there to receive training and learn to work. The cook had a problem because the forty-eight people came from different provinces in China. The Szechwan people liked spicy food, the northerners liked steamed buns, the southerners liked rice, and the Shantung people liked dumplings. When the cook served dumplings, the northerners were happy, but the southerners were not. When he served spicy food, the Szechwan saints enjoyed it, but the northerners could not eat it, and those from Shanghai suffered. These different reactions are the result of different habits. The workers had developed certain dietary habits since their childhood; hence, they found it difficult to accept other kinds of food.</p>
<p>In the same principle, if a new believer attends worship services and listens to sermons, after two months it will be difficult for him to change. He will develop the habit of listening to sermons. However, if immediately after a person is saved he begins to speak, to testify for the Lord, and to praise, give thanks, and sing hymns, he will enjoy such practices. If at this time he comes to the church meetings where he must sit and listen, he will feel uncomfortable, because he has a different taste. In this respect, for one person to speak and the rest to listen is not the right way. The right way is to have mutual encouragement and mutual teaching.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Proper Way for Believers to Meet and to Serve &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
