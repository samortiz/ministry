   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE 8 Scripture Reading: Mark 13:1-37</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give a further word on chapter thirteen, one of the most difficult chapters for us to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many readers of the New Testament regard Mark 13 merely as a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, this chapter is not merely a prophecy; it is also a word of preparation given by the Lord Jesus to His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two indications of this are the word temple in verse 1 and the expression birth pangs in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST AS THE UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter eleven the Lord Jesus cleansed the temple 11:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a very real sense, the Lord condemned the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After cleansing the temple, the Lord Jesus dealt with the leaders of Judaism, those who were especially concerned for the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The disciples heard all that the Lord said to those leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After such a thorough dealing with the temple and with the Jewish leaders, the Lord went out of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mark 13:1 says, And as He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples says to Him, Teacher, behold, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a strong indication that the Lord s disciples were still occupied with the traditional concept of the temple, which was a sign or symbol of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the disciples to still have such a regard for the temple meant that they were fully occupied with their old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s intention in His economy was to change the dispensation from the old things to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was God s desire that Christ would replace the things of the former dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason we say that Christ, who is both God and man, is the universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as the universal replacement was first revealed on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord brought three of His disciples to the top of this mountain in order to show them that God in His economy intended to replace everything with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There would be no place for Moses or Elijah, and no place for the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything and everyone must be replaced by Christ, the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus cleansed the temple, He was preparing to replace the old things with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was canceling, annulling, the things of the old dispensation in order to prepare the way for His disciples to take Him as their replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was preparing them to be brought into His death and resurrection so that He might be their all-inclusive replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PRODUCING OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To take Christ as our replacement through His death and resurrection is to be brought out of the old creation and to enter into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s economy is first to produce the old creation, and then to bring forth the new creation out of the old.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s new creation is mainly the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The producing of the new man out of the old creation involves the process of birth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The expression birth pangs in 13:8 refers to the travail involved in the birth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The period of time between Christ s resurrection and ascension and His coming back is for the delivery of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We believe that we are living toward the end of that period of time in which the new man is being delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Looking back upon more than nineteen centuries of history since the Lord s ascension, it is easy for us to realize that throughout the centuries many have experienced the birth pangs for the delivery of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jews, the Gentiles, and all the cultures and civilizations of the world have been part of these birth pangs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the wars that have taken place have been part of the birth pangs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These birth pangs are for one thing the bringing forth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today s world situation with its birth pangs is for the birth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reason I watch the world situation.</S>
