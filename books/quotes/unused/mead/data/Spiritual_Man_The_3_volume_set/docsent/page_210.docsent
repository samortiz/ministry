   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REJOICING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior" Luke 1:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit of a believer should take the attitude of brokenness towards self Psa 51:17 , while simultaneously rejoicing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer rejoices not because of something joyful or because of any personal experience, work, blessing, or environment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He rejoices because God is his center.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually speaking, apart from God, there is nothing which can make a believer rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a believer's spirit is suppressed by worry, grief, or sadness, his spirit immediately becomes derelict.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It becomes depressed and loses its proper position, unable to fulfill the Holy Spirit's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once a believer's spirit is suppressed by heavy burdens, it immediately loses its agility, freedom, and brightness, and it falls from the ascended position.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the period of grief is prolonged, the extent of the damage suffered by the spirit is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At such a time, nothing else can help except to rejoice in God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rejoice in the fact that God is God; rejoice in how God has accomplished everything to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer must not lose his "hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NOT COWARDLY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness" 2 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cowardice is not humbleness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being humble is absolutely forgetting one's self one's weaknesses as well as one's strengths.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being a coward is remembering one's weaknesses and one's self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Shrinking back and timidity do not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, God desires us to be trembling because we are nothing, but on the other hand, He wants us to be bold to step forward because of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be bold is to witness for the Lord, to suffer pain, to bear shame, to lose everything, to rely on the Lord, and to trust in His love, wisdom, power, truthfulness, and promises.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what the Lord desires of us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we see ourselves shrinking back in matters like witnessing for the Lord, we should realize that our spirit has left its proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should keep our spirit in "fearlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should have a spirit of power, love, and a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit needs to be strong and powerful, but it should not be so strong as to become unloving.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being quiet, self-disciplined, and not easily provoked are also important.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To resist the enemy, our spirit needs to be strong; to deal with people in the world, our spirit needs to be loving; to conduct ourselves properly, our spirit needs to be sober.</S>
