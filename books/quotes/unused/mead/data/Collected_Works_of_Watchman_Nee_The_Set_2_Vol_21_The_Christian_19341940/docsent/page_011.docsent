   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFESSION Issue No. 4 Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-5; Psa 32:1-7; Prov 28:13; Matt 5:23-26; 3:7-8; Luke 3:10-14 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The subject of confession is an important matter after one's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we must be clear that no Christian in this world can be saved through confession.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have said that without confession, there is no salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can be saved through confession.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One does not enter the sitting room and then pass through the main gate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither does one eat his meal before cooking his meal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although many things are turned upside down in this world, salvation cannot be turned upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some have said that the extent of man's forgiveness is the extent to which he has confessed his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to bury the glorious work of Christ in the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who propose this have also said that if one's eyes have sinned, he should nail them to the cross, and then the eyes will be free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One person said to me once, "Someone is preaching the message of the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I asked him whose cross he was preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that many are preaching the message of the cross, but whose cross are they preaching?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not our cross, but the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not our cross or crucifixion that will save us, but the cross of the Lord Jesus that saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we nailed our mouth or eyes to a cross, it would only be our cross; it would not be the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the cross of the Lord Jesus has borne our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He had not died, we would not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, our confession will not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am not saying that we do not need to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we must be careful not to put the sitting room in the middle of the street.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must distinguish between the first step and the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to see that we are saved first, and then we make confessions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Salvation comes first; confession comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing can save us except the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am not ignoring confession, but I desire to see the Lord Jesus uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not saved through confession; we are saved by the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While confession has nothing to do with salvation, it has much to do with reward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew 5:23-26 tells us that if our brother has something against us, the first thing we have to do is to be reconciled to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must do our best to be reconciled to him; otherwise, he will deliver us to the judge, and the judge will deliver us to the officer, and we will be thrown into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows us that when the Lord Jesus reigns in the millennium, this kind of Christian will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we must have this clear distinction before us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian is saved through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But after he is saved, he will suffer loss when the Lord comes to reign in the millennium if he has not confessed all his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE NEED FOR CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Proverbs 28:13 says, "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that all of our former sins must be confessed thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have sinned against man, we have to confess to man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have sinned against God, we have to confess to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not do this, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mr. Roberts was once asked by a brother concerning the secret to Christian growth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He answered by asking, "When was the last time you made a confession?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The brother did not understand what this meant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He wondered if confession had to be made daily, as often as taking a meal, and he admitted that he had not made a confession for a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later he found out what Mr. Roberts meant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Christian grows by making confessions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a man confesses to God what he has sinned against God, and confesses to man what he has sinned against man, he grows spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, many people do not feel sorry after they have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason they do not feel sorry is they have failed in the matter of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After a person believes in the Lord, he will run a good race if he confesses thoroughly all the sins he has committed against God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will run faster than many other Christians who have too little feeling concerning sin!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many people refrain from sins only because they do not want to "lose their face"; they do not sin because they do not want to lose their family's face or their own face.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some do not sin because they do not have the "capital" to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others do not sin because they are afraid of the consequence of sin; they do not sin because they are afraid that they will have to suffer as a result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How many of us do not sin because of the evil and filthiness of sin itself and because it is against God?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am surprised that so many people can sin and still sleep and eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our God hates sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not hate sin because we are afraid of losing our face, because we do not have the "capital" to sin, or because we are afraid of the consequence of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not sin because of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a Christian wants to have a hatred for sin, he must confess his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I can at least say that confession helps us have a hatred for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When I sin, I always feel much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But this feeling of suffering is good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Are there any unresolved things between you and others?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Rev K. once wrote in his diary: "There is nothing unresolved between myself and others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I can die without the need for regret or redress, and there is nothing more that I need to do."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brothers and sisters, can we say that we have thoroughly confessed our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Is there anyone among us who has not dealt thoroughly with his sins?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are often afraid to give an account of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This fear speaks of a problem on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If there is a small hole in a pear, we know that there must be something wrong inside the pear.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Sometimes we want to eat the pear, but do not want to open it up to see what is inside.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>THE EXTENT OF CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The extent of confession should be the extent of the offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We cannot confess more than we have sinned, nor can we confess less than we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Suppose the extent of my sin goes only as far as offending God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then the extent of my confession should be limited to God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the extent of my sin is such that it offends both God and my brothers, the extent of my confession should correspondingly cover them both.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we confess to others or publicly confess what we have sinned only against God or against individuals, we will fall into the error of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many revivalists charge people to confess their sins in public.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This will only defile the minds of others.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we have sinned against one person, all we have to do is confess to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we have sinned against five persons, all we have to do is confess to those five persons.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, if the extent of our sin is large, the extent of our confession cannot be small.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If I sin against both God and my brother, it is not enough for me to just confess to God, without confessing to my brother also.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The extent of confession should be the extent of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It cannot be more, nor can it be less.</S>
