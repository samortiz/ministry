<h1 class="title">PRAY-READING BEING THE EASIEST WAY<br />
TO ENJOY THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD WITH AN OPEN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Pray-reading is the easiest way to enjoy the Lord. Hence, when we read the Bible, we need an open spirit. We should not care for our past experiences of the Lord or for doctrines. Rather, we should pray over the words we read. This kind of prayer is simple, brief, genuine, and fresh. We should not use old, stale words, nor should we ponder or wait. We can simply take the words in the Bible as the words for our prayer, praying with the words in the Bible.</p>
<p>For example, Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; We can use this verse to pray, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me. Here is a law, and this law is the law of the Spirit of life. This is life, this is the Spirit, and this is also a law. Praise the Lord.&rdquo; When we pray with an open spirit in this way, we touch the Lord with our spirit through the words of the Bible, and we pave the way for the Holy Spirit to operate within us. When we pray-read with other saints in this way, they become inspired and pray according to their inspiration. We can even repeat one another&rsquo;s prayer in order to be enlivened. When we pray in this way, our prayers will always be fresh, because we use different portions of the Bible and pray with the words that we read. Even if we come to a verse that we do not understand, we can still use it for our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING IN THE WORD,<br />
AND THE LORD&rsquo;S WORDS BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This new way of reading the Bible is very effective because the Lord is in the words of the Bible, and the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life (John 6:63). The Holy Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s words are mingled together (Eph. 6:17). Hence, by praying over the Word, we can touch the Spirit through prayer. When we pray-read the Word, our spirit is mingled with the Spirit. Pray-reading is not for knowledge or doctrine, nor is it to pray for something or for someone. Pray-reading is to open our spirit to touch the Lord&rsquo;s words so that we can touch the Spirit and gain the Lord.</p>
<p>When we touch the Lord&rsquo;s word through pray-reading the Word, the Holy Spirit, our spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s words are mingled together, and we enjoy the Lord. We do not need to pray according to our old ways, according to what we were taught, or according to our knowledge. We should simply open the Bible and open our spirit to read two or three verses. Then we can pray over what we read, that is, use the words we read to pray. While we pray-read, the Holy Spirit will operate and express His thoughts within us. When we pray-read corporately, the Holy Spirit will operate within all the saints who are pray-reading, and they will be inspired to continue to pray. This inspiration is a response within the saints to one another. As we continue to practice, our pray-reading will become rich, and we will touch the Lord and enjoy Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
