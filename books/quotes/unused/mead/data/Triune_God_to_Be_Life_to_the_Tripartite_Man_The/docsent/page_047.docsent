   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Needing Us to Practice the Following Items</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must have our being by the Spirit in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also should not grieve the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CROSS AS THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>TO EXPERIENCE THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the embodiment of God, and the Spirit is the realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the object of our experience of the divine life, and the Spirit is the reality of the experience of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the way to experience the divine life is through the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Crucifixion, the Killing,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>the Death, of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Going with the Resurrection of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The crucifixion, the killing, the death, of Christ goes along with the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A good hymn concerning the death of Christ going along with the resurrection of Christ is #631 in Hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first stanza of this hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I'd know Christ's risen power,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I must ever love the Cross;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life from death alone arises;</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There's no gain except by loss.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The killing element of the death of Christ is in the compounded Spirit Exo 30:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Antibiotics contain certain elements which kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The killing elements in antibiotics are like the element of the death of Christ being compounded in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This killing element in the compound Spirit is applied to all negative persons, things, and matters related to us in our daily life, church life, and work, in the anointing of the Spirit as the anointing ointment 1 John 2:20, 27; Rom 8:13b; Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The anointing within us is the move of the compound Spirit as the compound ointment.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The killing element in the compounded Spirit, applied to all the negative persons, things, and matters in our life, is for us to live a crucified life by the power of Christ's resurrection life Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hymns #631 and #481 in Hymns both refer to the resurrection power for us to live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second stanza of hymn #481 written by A.B. Simpson says:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>'Tis not hard to die with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When His risen life we know;</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When our hearts with joy o'erflow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His resurrection power</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has come to dwell in me,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And my heart is gladly going</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Steps to Take the Way of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>for the Experience of the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To take the way of the cross, to apply the cross of Christ to us, for experiencing the divine life, we need to abide in the anointing of the Spirit 1 John 2:27b .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The anointing never ceases in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our need as believers is to abide in this anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we abide in this anointing, we must learn also not to reject the killing which is exercised on us in this anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should happily say "amen" whenever the Spirit wants to kill some negative things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cross and the Spirit, the death of Christ and the Spirit, both go together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have the cross, we have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have the Spirit, we have the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To experience the divine life, we need to experience Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the Spirit as the realization of Christ, and the cross of Christ, the death of Christ, as the way.</S>
