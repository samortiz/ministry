   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today, it is as if we have received the new way in a sedan chair.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to my observation, among us there are only very few who are laboring and struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever there is a slight frustration, many retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But what we should do is either give up or do it thoroughly and consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to my observation, all who are successful are given to their work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I know of an old sister who is over eighty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She flung everything aside and gave herself to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the end she saw a result.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to know that in God's creation there is a natural law: those who are not diligent cannot expect to have success.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The most obvious example is seen in the farmer's farming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created the heavens and the earth, and He sends rain and sunshine and has given us the air.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the farmer must still till the ground diligently before he will have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the practice of the new way, we must labor like a farmer before we will see a result.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many places have received the new way joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet when they put it into practice, they return to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, when they knock on doors, they still tremble while standing at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they open their mouth, they still tell "sea stories."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew 28 shows us that in His resurrection, the Lord returned to the disciples and said to them, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, all we need to do is to say Amen to the Lord's word and go according to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not need to tremble, for we are the full representatives from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we go, we should tell others, "Jesus Christ has sent me to you to tell you to believe in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they say that they do not know how to believe, you can lead them to pray, "Lord Jesus, I believe in You."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After you have prayed with them word by word, you can tell them, "You have believed, and you have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now I will baptize you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to exercise the Lord's authority to baptize people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the universe, from God's point of view, such a person is already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The poison of Christianity is in their attempt to make those to whom they preach clearly understand salvation before baptizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the word of the Lord says that we should go and should disciple all nations, baptizing them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only after doing this should we teach them of what the Lord has commanded us Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do we believe that it is time that saves men, or the Holy Spirit who saves men?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus said, "Go...baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With that word we go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the word of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Will He not honor His word?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 10:8, Paul quoted the word of the law in Deuteronomy 30:14.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He said that that word is the word of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, we need such a view.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the word of the law is the breath of God and contains God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should believe that when we go out to visit people and to preach the gospel, the Spirit operates in every word of ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we should simply tell others, "Jesus Christ has sent me here to tell you that you must believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not my word, but the word of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is in your mouth and even in your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must believe that your word is the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The difference between the new way and the old is that in the old way we try to speak of Christ without having Christ, whereas in the new way we have Christ, and we minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have no intention to boast concerning my age, but I have had much experience, so that I am convinced that it is not time that saves man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not "sea stories" that will dispense life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, it is the Spirit of God planting the word out of God's mouth into man that gives man life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the new way is a way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a way by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you want to preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If so, you must have faith; otherwise, you should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must believe that you are an ambassador of the Lord and that the Lord has sent you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as you will go, others will listen to your word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers, it is not enough to welcome and to receive the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It requires us to give ourselves to it and to follow it closely.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should do exactly as the Lord has said.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you preach the gospel and bring others to salvation, these become your children.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From your heart, you must consider them as newborn babes, and you should do your best to care for them, to nourish them, and to lead them on gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some have said that they have understood everything concerning the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But according to my observation, such persons have never entered into the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although they do not oppose the new way, their heart is not there; they are still working according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The principle that governs the way we do things in the world is the same as that which governs the way we do the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you hire a worker to work for you, and his heart is not in the work, and he is not of the same mind as you are, willing to sweat and give his life to the work, it is better for you not to hire such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must believe my words.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even a band of robbers must be in one accord and give their life to their work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the United States there are a few brothers in business who are renowned marketing managers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They asked me, "Brother Lee, from whom have you learned?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The way you preach the gospel is exactly the same as the way we teach others to sell."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have not learned from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have learned from the Bible.</S>
