   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING THE CHURCH BY BAPTIZING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 28:19, the Lord revealed the way to build up the church: Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. The nations, pagans, need to be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After they have been discipled, they must be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christianity has made baptism a formal ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in Matthew 28 baptism is not a ritual; it is the immersing of the believers of Christ into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Christianity a pastor may baptize a new convert either by sprinkling a few drops of water upon him or by immersing him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In either case he may say, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But whether the new convert is sprinkled or immersed, he remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nothing has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Years ago, in South America, a Catholic priest baptized a certain native boy and changed his name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After bringing him into the cathedral and sprinkling water upon him, the priest changed his name to John.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time Catholics were not allowed to eat meat on Fridays.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On a particular Friday John was preparing some venison to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Realizing that he should not eat meat on Friday, John decided to change the venison into fish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said to himself, If the priest could change my name by sprinkling water on me, then I can change this venison to fish by sprinkling water on it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, he sprinkled water on the venison and called it fish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the priest walked by, he smelled the venison cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Offended, he rebuked John, saying, John, don t you know that today is Friday and that you are not allowed to eat meat?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must eat fish today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John replied, I have done the same thing to the venison that you did to me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You sprinkled water on me and changed my name to John, and I sprinkled water on the venison and called it fish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This illustrates what a ritual baptism has become throughout much of so-called Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genuine baptism is a matter of putting people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus did not tell the disciples to baptize the nations into water; He told them to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One writer has pointed out that the name here denotes the Person of the divine Being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, to baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to baptize them into the Person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we baptize others, we must exercise our spirit and our faith to say, We do not merely place you into the water; we are immersing you into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before now, you were outside the Triune God and had nothing whatever to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we are putting you into the Triune God; hereafter you will be one who is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, He appeared to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the doors were shut where the disciples were, on the day of His resurrection, the Lord, with a physical body, mysteriously entered the room John 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As He was speaking with them, He breathed into them and said, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came back to breathe Himself into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians know what took place on the day of Pentecost, but they do not know what happened on the day of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not know that on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit of life into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into them, we are not told that He left them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that He stayed within them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After He breathed Himself into them, He remained within them as their life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most Christians think that the Holy Spirit was not given to the disciples until the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a mistaken concept.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fifty days earlier than Pentecost, the Lord breathed the Spirit into the disciples, and they received the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Acts chapter one, the disciples were able to pray for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How could they have done this if they did not have the Spirit within them?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only way one hundred and twenty believers could pray in one accord for ten days was to have Christ as the life-giving Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT OF POWER</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the disciples had the Spirit of life within them, they did not yet have the Spirit of power upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For that, they had to wait until the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time the ascended Christ poured Himself upon the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the day of resurrection, the disciples received the life of resurrection, for they received the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But on the day of Pentecost the ascended Christ poured Himself upon His disciples to empower them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, on the day of Pentecost the disciples had both the Spirit of life within them and the Spirit of power upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Within and without, they were permeated, saturated, and filled with the Spirit.</S>
