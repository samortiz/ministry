   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT FELLOWSHIP GIVEN IN A PRAYER MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE FULL-TIME TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord burdened us to spend some specific time to look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our body is able to make it, we will kneel down before the Lord and fast and pray for three mornings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this training we have focused mostly on our homework and have rarely spent time together in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We concentrate our efforts on homework and have little time and energy to pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every time we pray, we should spend much time to have specific prayers before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should consider prayer as our way to take care of business and do our work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The prayer meeting should not be an ordinary meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a time when we come together to do business before the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PRAYING FOR THE FULL-TIME TRAINING Giving Thanks to the Lord for the Training</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we pray, I hope we will pay attention to four items: First, we should give thanks to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to thank Him for guiding us peacefully and smoothly through the training and for blessing us and being gracious to us in so many respects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of our brothers and sisters have participated in this training despite impossible situations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all these situations the Lord has been gracious to us and brought us through step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of us, in terms of the capacity of our physical body, would have had no way to meet the various requirements of the training, but the Lord has brought us through.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the training we have been busy with many things, running here and there, yet the Lord has cared for us and sustained us in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has also kept many of the families of the brothers and sisters from distracting matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of the approximately four hundred trainees, none of them has had any mishaps during this period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, the Lord has also provided us with the most convenient environmental arrangement, materials, and personnel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can say that we have had no lack, no problem, in terms of general affairs and financial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, we have been able to concentrate all our effort and energy on the teaching materials.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This has truly been a great blessing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time, we also thank Him for the speaking, messages, and materials He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Looking to the Lord for His Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>on the Results of the Training</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, we should look to the Lord concerning the training that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to pray solemnly to the Lord to offer this training to Him, to give ourselves into His hand, and to ask for His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not trust in anything except the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter how much we do, without the Lord s blessing everything is in vain and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that we have and do depends on the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we look to the Lord to add His blessing to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that in the coming days we will see the result of this training manifested in each one of us year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Together we must look to the Lord for this training to produce ongoing results so that the words spoken in the training will gradually shine in our being to become part of our being and our practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also ask the Lord that in the coming years, whether it be two, three, or even four years, He will lead us to review these lessons so that we can experience the reality spoken of in them in our daily living and service and thereby supply His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Asking the Lord for His Shining</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Third, each one of us needs to kneel before the Lord and look to Him for His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During this time we should ask the Lord to shine on us and touch us regarding our personal condition, problems, and any matter that we have not been able to get through, escape, put aside, overcome, or deal with before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a heavy burden within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that in the Lord s presence we can all be enlightened and touched by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether we have a problem with our character, with a spiritual matter, with our coordination, or with our work, we should ask the Lord to meet us in all these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Looking to the Lord Corporately</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>for the Church</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fourth, we need to look to the Lord corporately for His church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should look to Him to show us how His church should advance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does He want to accomplish on earth through the church?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How should we follow the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What function does the church carry out for the Lord on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What does the Lord desire the church to carry out in this age?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must ask the Lord for His blessing and grace that the church would be well pleasing to Him on the earth, that whatever should be used would be used by Him, that whatever should be blessed would receive His blessing, that whatever should be released for the Lord s gospel would be released, that those who should fight for the Lord would fight for Him absolutely, and that those who should testify for the Lord would testify for Him faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the church be able to follow the Lord s leading and meet His need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the church be blessed so that it does not lose His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord so leads, we should all kneel down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether we pray out loud one by one, pray silently, or pray out loud simultaneously depends on our sense from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, this should not be fixed but should be free and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes a certain atmosphere requires everyone to be quiet and pray one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another time in a certain situation we may all need to be silent before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At yet another time every one of us may need to open our mouth simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some might grieve and confess before the Lord, and others may offer thanks and praises before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever the case, we should grant the Holy Spirit absolute liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, we need to give the Lord the liberty, but on the other hand, we need to fear the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>None of us should be unruly or loose before the Lord, and none should have his own activity or an intention to make a display of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We pray that the Lord would meet us in a strong way.</S>
