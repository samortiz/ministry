TO BE EXPERIENCED IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
THROUGH EXERCISE AND PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Sixth, we need to be experienced in the Lord&rsquo;s word through exercise and practice (Heb. 5:13-14). Hebrews 5:14 says, &ldquo;Who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.&rdquo; Here <em>faculties</em> can mean senses, implying the powers of perception. Our faculties can become experienced by our exercise and practice. Hence, when we study the Lord&rsquo;s word, we need to exercise our mind, apprehension, memory, and understanding; if we are willing to exercise properly, we will become experienced. As long as some people have the Bible in their hands, they can skillfully link Hebrews to Matthew and then link Matthew to Romans. Sometimes they may even be able to link these books to the Old Testament. A person can do this if he is experienced in using the Bible, whereas this is extremely difficult for one who has just begun to study the Bible. Therefore, if we want to be prophets in the word of God, we must have a foundation in the words of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEARNED<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD TO COMMIT<br />
WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED<br />
TO THOSE WHO WILL BE COMPETENT<br />
TO TEACH OTHERS ALSO</h2>
<p>Seventh, those who are learned in the Lord&rsquo;s word need to commit what they have learned to those who will be competent to teach others also. Second Timothy 2:2 says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; If a person knows the Lord&rsquo;s word and also knows that a certain brother is a faithful one, he should teach that brother; moreover, the purpose of his teaching that brother is so that the brother would teach others also. However, if a brother does not learn what he has been taught, it will be difficult for him to teach others. We need to learn whatever we are taught; then after we learn, we can teach others. In short, if we want to learn to prophesy in the church, we need to labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word and learn how to speak for God and speak forth God. No one can teach others without first learning himself. Hence, we all need to endeavor to learn to prophesy and then teach others to prophesy.</p>
<p>Through the study of the new way in the recent years and through the revelation the Lord has shown us, we have seen that prophesying is the most important practice for the building up of the church. Hence, we are considering before God how to train the elders in regard to leading and speaking so that all the elders may be apt to teach. If we were able to train one thousand elders to be apt to teach, it would be an easy task to gospelize the whole island of Taiwan. If these one thousand elders were sent to five hundred places, I believe that five hundred churches would be raised up within a year. We truly hope to be able to carry this out. However, not only the elders need to learn but all the saints in the church life also need to be serious learners.</p>
<p>The secret to being an elder lies in being able to lead the church and in being one who is apt to teach. If an elder has learned these two items, it will be easy for him to administrate the church. Thus, an elder who means business will realize that it is not easy to be an elder because it is not the same as being a civil servant who works from nine to five and only takes care of his assigned duties. In contrast, it is easy to be a nominal elder, one who sleeps peacefully every night and cares for nothing. It does not matter to him whether the singing is proper, whether the saints understand the Scriptures, whether there is a supply in the meeting, or whether the condition of the saints is good. To be this kind of elder is easy and comfortable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this kind of elder will make the saints suffer and cause them to murmur. When the church has problems, such an elder cannot handle them. When the saints have troubles, such an elder cannot bear the burdens. He will not only cause the church to suffer but also stir up murmurings. Eventually, such a brother may say that he does not want to be an elder any longer. Therefore, the most difficult thing in the church life is for the elders to lead the meetings and be apt to teach.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if all the elders from the more than one hundred churches in Taiwan were able to pass through a two-month training in which they could learn how to lead the churches. First Timothy 3:2 uses the words <em>apt to teach</em> and 5:17 speaks of taking the lead well. If all the elders learn to be apt to teach and to take the lead well, the church will flourish. Concerning these two matters, taking the lead well is not as difficult as being apt to teach. Experience tells us that it is somewhat easy to serve and to lead people, but it often takes great effort to teach others. For instance, if we want to teach a person mathematics, we must first learn mathematics; if we want to teach someone how to use a computer, we must first have some knowledge of computers. In the same principle, in order to teach others to be prophets, to speak for God, we must first labor on the Lord&rsquo;s word. I hope that all the young people, including the sisters, will receive this word, be trained, pursue the Lord, love the Lord, give themselves to the Lord, and most importantly, enter into the Lord&rsquo;s word and be able to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. We all need to learn how to speak the Lord into people by speaking His word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
