   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Colossians 2:5 Paul says, "For though indeed I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you, rejoicing and seeing your order and the firmness of your faith in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse indicates that Paul was a person who lived in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When he wrote this word to the Colossians, he was far away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, he could say that he was with them in spirit, rejoicing and seeing their order and the firmness of their faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his spirit Paul had a heavenly telescope through which he could see the situation of the saints in Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He knew that they were in order and that their faith was firm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Colossians Paul speaks of the divine Spirit 1:8 and the human spirit 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that in order to experience Christ, we need these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have pointed out, we also need to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The secret of experiencing Christ has much to do with the Word, the Spirit, faith, the human spirit, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>RELEASING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the book of Colossians Paul covers not only the secret of experiencing Christ, the Head, but also the secret of experiencing the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to know the secret of experiencing the Head for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1:24 Paul says, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fact that Paul suffered for the Body indicates that whatever we experience of Christ must be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not supply the Body with our experience of Christ, our experience will be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider your physical body: every member of your body enjoys the circulation of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if the blood flowed into your arm and stayed there, not continuing to circulate through the rest of the body, that would be a sign of serious trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your whole body would be in great danger.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This illustration shows that we should not keep our experience of Christ for ourselves, but use it to supply the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ultimate issue of our experience of Christ must be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During my years in Christianity, I did not hear anything about the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither was I told that we need to receive grace from the Lord and then transmit this grace to other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We definitely need to exercise our spirit by prayer to receive the Word so that we may have the Spirit and faith to experience Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But what we receive of Christ must then be released to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not hold it for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our spiritual blood vessels need to be enlarged to allow the life supply to pass through us to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not keep the supply for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do this, you will have serious difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Come to the church meetings and release your experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we release, the more supply we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why I am not exhausted by ministering the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, speaking always supplies me with more spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the flow goes out, more comes in. In fact, the inflow depends on the outflow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we release, the more we are able to take in. The more we release for the Body, the more supply we shall receive for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Word, the Spirit, faith, our spirit, and our prayer must all be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Release Christ and release the spirit for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not come to the meetings to sit in silence, but come to release your experience of Christ to the Body.</S>
