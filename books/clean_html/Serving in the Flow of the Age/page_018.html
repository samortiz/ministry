<h1 class="title">THE KEY TO SERVING&mdash;BEING BLENDED IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT AND DELIVERED FROM THE MIND</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; If we try to practice speaking to one another but are not filled in spirit, it will be as exhausting as rolling a flat tire. We should never neglect the essential matter of being filled in spirit when we practice speaking to one another.</p>
<p>We have been fellowshipping about the spirit for years, yet we have not been exercising our spirit. The Pentecostal movement still exists and even is spreading to some extent because it pays attention to the Spirit. Although Pentecostals do not have the truth as we do, they do focus on the Spirit. Thus, they have some reality. In contrast, we may have the truth, but we do not exercise our spirit. Whether the Pentecostal movement is genuine or false, their speaking in tongues turns them from their mind to their spirit. This is a principle of the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>I have attended Pentecostal gatherings, and to an extent some things there are genuine. Even some things in Catholicism are genuine. However, it is important for us to be able to discern what is genuine from what is not. If a person cannot discern, he will be poisoned. Matthew 13:33 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; The woman in this verse symbolizes the Catholic Church, which took leaven and mingled it with fine flour. Leaven signifies evil, condemnable things. The woman hid the leaven in three measures of meal, making it difficult to discern the leaven from the fine flour. In order to be safe, we could discard everything, but if we discard everything, we will discard some fine flour as well. We need to be like Watchman Nee, who was a very discerning person. He was able to discern the leaven, which should be discarded, and the fine flour, which should be kept. He was able to discern the good from the bad in every denominational and Christian practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS FOR SPEAKING IN THE MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Simple and Speaking from the Spirit</h2>
<p>We have been taught so thoroughly by Christianity for so long that whenever we speak, we linger in our mind. However, our speaking in the meeting should come from our spirit and be simple. Unless one really has a message and needs more time, the simpler the speaking, the better it is. We need to practice this. The principle is the same for leading a Bible study. Some do not lead well, so the meeting goes down and the spirit is low. Others lead well, so the meeting is on fire and the spirit is fanned into flame. There is a great difference between the two. The vitality and strength of our spirit depend upon our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Preaching to One Another but Practicing Together</h2>
<p>It is common for the brothers and sisters to speak to one another as if they are preaching. When we speak to one another, we just need to speak the hymns with our spirit; there is no need to preach or explain. Even though we have paid attention to the matter of speaking to one another over the years, we have not practiced it much. In particular, the leading ones do not practice; they only want to study how the young people are practicing it. However, matters of life cannot be studied; study only limits the production of life. We cannot study an egg while a hen is brooding upon it. If we try to study the egg, it will not hatch. Hence, the leading ones should practice, not just study.</p>
<p>Some brothers&rsquo; prayers are like a message. Such ones should learn from the way that Americans process their fish; they cut off the head and the tail and serve only the two choicest fillets. The meeting needs the spirit and the supply of life; the leading ones must take the lead to practice speaking to one another first so that they supply life and lead the saints into this practice as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Spirit Needing to Be Strong and Released</h2>
<p>Some have led the saints to walk around in the meetings, but this is not necessary. Our meetings need to be strong in spirit, not strong in physical activity. Our spirits should be released, not our physical bodies. This does not mean that we should not clap our hands in the meeting; even Psalm 47:1 speaks of this. However, we should not be excessive. We must realize that the New Testament is different from the Old Testament. The Old Testament focuses on outward matters, but the New Testament focuses on the spirit. If the spirits of the saints reach a climax and there is no other way to express it, there is no problem with clapping. However, it is not good if clapping turns into a custom. Such practices abound in the Pentecostal movement, but we should not focus on them. We should have a strong and released spirit; there is no need for much physical activity.</p>
