   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, there is no need for anyone to struggle to perform miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When God's power is manifested in us, there are miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was bitten by a viper, and he shook it off into the fire Acts 28:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How did Paul perform that miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not tell the men of the island of Malta, "Come and see me perform a great miracle for you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He shook the snake into the fire without any fanfare.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was no promotion of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only those who do not know God promote miracles; those who know God do not promote miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not mean that those who do not promote miracles know God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some do not believe in God or miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who know God do not promote miracles because miracles are spontaneous things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers and sisters, when God answers your prayer and you feel that you have done something marvelous, it proves that your faith is very immature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you really believe in the power of God, you will find Him answering your prayers and performing miracles without even being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under such circumstances, miracles are spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no need for any struggle, and they will not be extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that miracles are not performed in a conscious way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we feel that we are performing miracles, we have failed already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, when we set our mind to perform miracles, they will be far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like setting our mind to do good; we discover that we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we live in the presence of God and believe in Him, there will be miracles spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The miracle of not being hurt by the viper was done without Paul's even noticing it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If others asked him to do the same thing again, he might not be able to repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If someone asked us to repeat what Paul did, we could not do it either.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot imitate others, and we cannot reenact our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are touching a very important principle of the Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our Christian experience, God's answer to our prayer and His miracles follow one basic principle everything is spontaneous, and everything is done without our awareness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning, we may think that we had much strength and great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But as we go on and learn more, we will no longer feel the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To some degree, we will not even know how we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We simply commit things into God's hand, and things are done spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Paul we see many miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet Paul said of himself, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" 1 Cor 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is willing to work through man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But He is not willing to allow man to become conscious of what he can do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only those who do not know God say that they can do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who genuinely know God say that they do not know what they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man whom God truly uses will not feel that he can do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever he has done is behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank God, His power is so great that He can do everything Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we go on as a Christian, the simpler we become.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who become complicated are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we know God, the simpler we become.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are just what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even our believing will not be as strenuous as before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day by day as we live before the Lord, we will become simpler and simpler.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will say genuinely from our heart that everything is of God and not of us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, if we truly know God, we will know that all of His work in us is spontaneous.</S>
