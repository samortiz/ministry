   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR ENVIRONMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>COOPERATING WITH THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO KILL OUR NATURAL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The putting to death of Jesus in our environment cooperates with the indwelling Spirit to kill our natural man our outer man , comprising our body and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is mentioned emphatically in 2 Corinthians 4:10-12.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said that he was bearing about in his body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have the indwelling Spirit within us, but because we are sometimes stiff-necked and stubborn, God raises up the environment to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The entire situation of our living rises up against us to help the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The indwelling Spirit works to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is the Killer, but He needs an instrument, a "knife," to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The "knife" may be a brother's wife, his children, or certain brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A certain saint can become a "knife" which the Spirit uses to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all like to have a nice environment, with everything smooth, peaceful, sweet, and nice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When people ask us, "How are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We always say, "Fine."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times when we say this, however, we are lying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we were fully honest, we would respond by saying, "Not so good."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because we are under an environment of sufferings and pressures which works with the Spirit to kill our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee referred to this kind of environment as the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The putting to death, the killing, in 2 Corinthians 4 is through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In speaking about the application of Christ's death, Romans 8 refers to the indwelling Spirit, while 2 Corinthians 4 refers to the outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The outward environment cooperates with the inward Spirit to carry out the killing of our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second Corinthians 4:16 says, "Our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word decaying means being consumed, being wasted away, being worn out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Chinese translation of the Bible, it can also mean "being destroyed."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As our outer man is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inner man is being renewed with the fresh supply of the resurrection life.</S>
