<p>Man&rsquo;s thoughts concerning God are about how to worship, fear, and please Him. When a person enjoys the world and does evil things, he puts God aside and does not care about God. When he receives mercy and turns to God, he begins to think about God and care for God and immediately desires to worship God, do things for God in order to please Him, and do His will. Man cannot escape from such thoughts.</p>
<p>Even the messages that are preached among Christians are according to the concept of worshipping God and doing things to please Him. Preachers tell people how to worship God, how to obey His will, how to please Him, and how to do things for Him. These concepts and teachings are natural; they are man&rsquo;s natural, religious concepts and are not according to God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>I once visited the second largest mosque in the world and saw many Moslems worshipping. Their worship involved prostrating their whole body. Although they displayed indescribable solemnity and devoutness, it was truly pitiful. They expended a substantial amount of energy in order to worship God, but they did not know that God does not care for that kind of worship.</p>
<p>What does God want? Religionists and Jewish rabbis might say that God wants people to worship Him. Muslim imams might say that people should wash themselves and bow down to God reverently five times a day. Catholic priests might say that it is best to attend mass every day. Even Christian pastors and preachers might say that we should learn to pray quietly and worship God. These are all religious answers. They are man&rsquo;s natural concept. They are not what God wants.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF GOD IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible does not teach us to do something for God. In the beginning of the Bible there is a blueprint, and at the end of the Bible there is a building. If we compare the building with the blueprint, we will know what God wants to do in the universe and in man.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Bible there is the tree of life, and at the end there is also the tree of life. In the beginning of the Bible the tree of life is outside of Adam (Gen. 2:8-9), but at the end, in the book of Revelation, the tree of life is inside the holy city, New Jerusalem (22:1-2). The New Jerusalem is a corporate man and includes the New Testament saints who are represented by the twelve apostles and the Old Testament saints who are represented by the twelve tribes of Israel (21:12, 14). In the New Jerusalem man will no longer be facing the tree of life; instead, the tree of life will be in man.</p>
<p>Although the tree of life was outside man in the beginning of Genesis, God&rsquo;s intention was for the tree of life to enter into man. The tree of life is a fruit tree, and the fruit was to be man&rsquo;s food. Hence, when God placed man before the tree of life, His intention was for man to eat of the tree of life. At the end of Revelation the tree of life has entered into man.</p>
<p>In the blueprint presented in Genesis 2 there is a flowing river producing gold, bdellium, and precious stones (vv. 10-12). At the consummation of the Bible, in Revelation, there is a river of water of life flowing throughout the city (22:1), and the city is constituted with gold, pearl, and precious stones (21:18-21). These two pictures are a reflection of one another.</p>
<p>This shows that God&rsquo;s intention is not for man to worship Him or serve Him outwardly, nor is it for man to do anything for Him. God is pleased to be man&rsquo;s life. He placed Himself before man as the tree of life so that man would take Him in.</p>
<p>Genesis 2 does not show that God was sitting on a glorious brightly shining throne surrounded by cherubim and angels and commanding Adam to worship Him. On the contrary, God was manifested before Adam in the form of a tree. He did not display His power or splendor, nor did He require Adam to do something. He only asked that Adam would receive Him as food.</p>
<p>John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Later, the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the true vine&rdquo; (15:1). These verses show that the Lord is the tree of life mentioned in Genesis 2. He has no intention for man to worship Him, serve Him, or do anything for Him. His desire is for man to receive Him, not to receive something from man outwardly but for man to receive Him as food inwardly.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew a Canaanite woman cried out, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!&rdquo; (15:22). She wanted the Lord to do something for her, but the Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the little dogs&rdquo; (v. 26). The Lord was bread given by God to His children, and hence, He should not be given to dogs. The Canaanite woman had wisdom from the Holy Spirit, and she said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table&rdquo; (v. 27). She seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Yes, Lord. You are the bread, yet today You are not on the table; You were thrown off the table to the ground. You have been debased by God&rsquo;s children in the land of Israel, and You are in the Gentile land. The land of Israel is the table, and the Gentile land is under the table. You are the bread given by God to the people of Israel, but they were naughty and improper and threw You, the bread, off the table. Hence, a little dog such as I can eat the crumbs which fell from the table.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus praised this woman and said, &ldquo;O woman, great is your faith!&rdquo; (v. 28). This shows that the Lord Jesus considered Himself to be the bread of life that came down from heaven (John 6:35, 51), and as such, He desired to enter into man. He wanted man to eat Him and receive Him so that He might be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LORD AS LIFE<br />
AND LIVING HIM OUT</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is not to teach doctrine or to correct our behavior. His purpose is life. God knows that we cannot do His will or do anything for Him out of ourselves. However, if we receive Him as food daily, taking Him as our life, we will do His will. Even though we may not think of pleasing Him, everything we are will be pleasing to Him, and we will spontaneously worship and serve Him. All the situations in our living will have His flavor, and He will be expressed through us.</p>
<p>A brother once said that some people smell like cows because they drink much milk and eat much butter and beef. They eat the produce of cows every day, so eventually they smell like cows. We smell like what we eat. The things in the physical realm are symbols of things in the spiritual realm. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57). A person who receives the Lord as food will live and grow by the Lord, and he will also &ldquo;smell&rdquo; of the Lord.</p>
<p>May the eyes of the young saints be opened to see that God does not want us to worship Him, to serve Him, or to do something for Him. He is still standing before us as the tree of life. He is in His Word and the Spirit, waiting for us to use our spirit to receive Him. We should take Him as life, and let Him live in us (Col. 3:4). This is a glorious matter. As long as we can lay hold of this matter, we will have many glorious experiences of expressing Him. This is the story of life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
