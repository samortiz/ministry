OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(94)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in 2 Peter. Although 1 and 2 Peter are short, these Epistles indicate that the apostle Peter, who had been a fisherman, was brought into the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s salvation according to His divine economy. The riches of Christ that are unveiled in Peter&rsquo;s two Epistles reveal all the divine elements of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">110. Our God and Savior</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:1-18 is a particular and crucial portion of the holy Word, which reveals excellent points regarding our experience and enjoyment of Christ as our God and Savior. We need to dwell on this portion of the Word so that we may not only appreciate and apprehend but also experience and enjoy the Christ unveiled therein.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 1 speaks of &ldquo;our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Jesus Christ is both our God and our Savior. This indicates that Jesus Christ is God being our Savior. He is the God whom we worship, and He became our Savior to save us. At Peter&rsquo;s time this designated the believers in Christ and separated them from the Jews, who believed Jehovah the Creator to be God yet did not believe that Jesus Christ was God, and from the Gentiles, particularly the Romans, who believed that Caesar, not Jesus Christ, was God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In His Righteousness<br />
We Having Been Allotted Equally Precious Faith</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:1 tells us that in the righteousness of Christ as our God and Savior, we &ldquo;have been allotted faith equally precious as ours.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) In His Righteousness</h2>
<p>The righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, is a double portion, consisting of both the righteousness of Christ and the righteousness of God. Our God is righteous. Through His righteousness He has allotted the precious faith as a divine portion equally to all believers in Christ, both Jewish and Gentile, without respect of persons. Now He is not only our God but also our Savior. Thus, His righteousness now is not the righteousness only of God nor only of Christ, but the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In that the Lord is our Savior, His righteousness is His righteous act, His death on the cross in absolute obedience (Phil. 2:8), by which He accomplished redemption for us (Heb. 9:12), enabling us to be justified by God (Rom. 5:18). The righteousness of Christ refers to His righteous deeds, His righteous acts. When He lived, walked, and worked on earth as a man, He did everything righteously; all His acts, deeds, and works were righteous. In particular, when He died on the cross, becoming obedient to God, that obedience was a righteous deed. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross was in absolute obedience to God and fulfilled all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness and gave the righteous God the legitimate position to justify all those who believe in this righteous deed of Christ. In other words, the righteousness of Christ is the factor and base for God to justify us. Christ lived righteously, obeyed righteously, and died righteously, thereby building up His righteousness as a base for God to justify those who believe in Christ.</p>
<p>In that the Lord is our God, His righteousness is His justice, since, based on the righteous act, the redemption of our Savior Jesus Christ (3:24-25), He justifies all the believers in Christ (v. 26), both Jewish and Gentile (v. 30). In and by such a twofold righteousness, the righteousness of both our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ, the precious faith, the precious substantiation of the New Testament blessing, has been allotted equally to all believers among all nations.</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:1 two kinds of righteousness&mdash;the righteousness of God and the righteousness of Christ&mdash;are put together. The righteousness of Christ accomplished redemption. Now God in His righteousness justifies us. It is in the sphere of and by means of this twofold righteousness that the precious faith has been allotted equally to all believers.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s word concerning the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, is rich in what it indicates and implies. The common thought among the Jews at Peter&rsquo;s time was that God gave them certain blessings for their enjoyment. Those blessings were given according to their own righteousness. The Jews thought that if they lived and acted righteously, they would have their own righteousness before God. That was the righteousness according to the law. Hence, it is called the righteousness of the law. This means that our own righteousness is the righteousness of the law. Paul refers to this in Romans 10:3: &ldquo;Because they were ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God.&rdquo; In Philippians 3:9 Paul declared that his desire was to be found in Christ, &ldquo;not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not according to the righteousness of the law that God has allotted us our New Testament portion. The New Testament portion is allotted to us by God in and by the kind of righteousness that is both the righteousness of God and the righteousness of Christ. The righteousness of God is versus our own righteousness, and the righteousness of Christ is versus the righteousness of the law.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s word regarding the righteousness of our God and Savior indicates that the dispensation has changed. In the Old Testament the basis upon which people were blessed was their righteousness according to the law. This means that they were blessed according to man&rsquo;s righteousness, which is also the righteousness of the law. But now, in the New Testament, God gives us a wonderful portion, not because of our own righteousness according to the law but because of His righteousness according to Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Instead of going back to the law, we need to come to Christ. What we have is not our righteousness according to the Mosaic law; it is God&rsquo;s righteousness fulfilled by the righteous act of Christ on the cross. It is in and by this righteousness that God has allotted to us our New Testament inheritance.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Our Having Been Allotted Faith<br />
Equally Precious as Ours</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:1 tells us that we &ldquo;have been allotted faith equally precious as ours.&rdquo; The God-given faith is allotted to all believers as a common precious portion. As long as we have this gift, we have the lot of God&rsquo;s inheritance, for living faith equals the lot of God&rsquo;s inheritance. When Paul indicated in Colossians 1:12 that Christ is the allotted portion of the saints, he had in view the allotment of the good land of Canaan given to the children of Israel for their inheritance. Likewise, Peter had the same view in mind when he in 2 Peter 1:1 spoke of our being allotted faith equally precious as ours. Peter realized that just as the children of Israel were allotted a piece of the good land (Josh. 13:6; 14:1-5; 19:51), all the New Testament believers are the children of God who inherit that which has been promised by God, that is, faith that has been allotted to them. This implies that the &ldquo;all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:3), including the divine nature (v. 4) partaken of by the believers through the equally precious faith according to the precious and exceedingly great promises, are the real inheritance given to the believers by God in the New Testament. The good land, the portion of the children of Israel in Old Testament times, typifies the all-inclusive Christ. As the good land was the portion of the Old Testament saints, so Christ is the portion of the New Testament believers. Furthermore, in the Old Testament the good land was allotted to the twelve tribes, and in the New Testament precious faith is allotted to us.</p>
<p>How can faith be our allotted portion? According to the Bible, Christ is our portion. This means that it is Christ who has been allotted to us. But 2 Peter 1:1 says that we have been allotted faith equally precious. To speak of Christ being our portion may be somewhat doctrinal. It is more experiential to say that faith is our portion. If Christ were merely Christ to us and not also faith, we would not be able to participate or share in Him. In order for us to partake of Christ, He must become our faith. Such a faith has been allotted by God to all believers in Christ as their portion. Faith has become our portion of the New Testament inheritance.</p>
<p>Faith is not merely a means; it is also a portion. A means is an instrument through which we obtain something, but a portion is the thing we obtain. In 2 Peter 1:1 faith is not a means; rather, it is the thing, the object, we receive. Therefore, in this verse faith equals the inheritance. According to the New Testament, faith in a certain sense is a means. In particular, faith is the means by which we receive salvation and eternal life (Eph. 2:8). But in 2 Peter 1:1 faith is not considered as a means but an allotment, a portion of the New Testament inheritance allotted to us by God.</p>
<p>Faith in 2 Peter 1:1 is equal to the New Testament inheritance. Our portion is Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God. This Christ is revealed in the New Testament and conveyed to us through the New Testament. The New Testament is a container of the Christ who embodies the Triune God. This container conveys Christ to us mainly by way of the preaching and teaching of the Word. The preaching and the teaching of the apostles always convey Christ to others. The Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is contained in the New Testament. Then this Christ is conveyed to us through the preaching and teaching of the Word. The New Testament contains Christ, and those who preach the New Testament bring this container to us. Through this means this container conveys Christ to us. Faith, then, comes from hearing, and hearing comes from the word (Rom. 10:17). The function of the Word is to convey Christ to us. Therefore, Christ comes to us through the preaching and teaching of the word of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive Christ is not only the Word but also the life-giving Spirit. While Christ is preached to us through the Word and conveyed by the Word, He simultaneously works within us as the Spirit to produce faith in us. The issue of the faith produced within us is that whatever Christ is according to the word of the New Testament is imparted to us. As a result, we have the reality of Christ.</p>
<p>Faith and Christ are one. The faith, which is the response to the content of the Word is actually Christ. This means that the response is one with that to which it is responding. When in our experience our response and the Christ conveyed to us through the preaching of the Word become one, faith is produced within us. Therefore, our faith and Christ, who is the object of our faith, are actually one. This is the portion of the New Testament inheritance that God has allotted to us.</p>
<p>Faith is not initiated by us, and it is not something that is out of us. On the contrary, faith is out of God, it is initiated by God, and it is allotted to us by God. Faith comes to us by the word in God&rsquo;s revelation. When this word is preached to us, it conveys the reality of the New Testament inheritance. As this word is preached to us, simultaneously the Spirit works with it. Actually, according to the Bible, the word and the Spirit are one. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word (Eph. 6:17). Therefore, through the spoken word and by the working, the inspiring, of the Spirit, faith is produced within us. This is the way that God allots to us the equally precious faith. Through the spoken word and by the inspiring Spirit, God infuses faith into our being. Once this faith has been imparted into us, we have our portion of the New Testament inheritance.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;equally precious&rdquo; means &ldquo;of equal value or honor&rdquo;; hence, equally precious. It does not mean equal in measure but in value and honor to all those who receive it. Faith is equally precious to all the believers in Christ, no matter whether they are Jews or Gentiles. We have the same faith that Peter had. Although Peter was a great apostle, in quality the faith he had was not different from the faith that we have. He and we share the equally precious faith. All the believers in the Gentile world share with all those in the Jewish land the same precious faith, which enables them to substantiate the blessing of life of the New Testament as their common portion allotted to them by God.</p>
<p>The expression <em>allotted faith equally precious as ours</em> in 2 Peter 1:1 indicates that in the whole universe there is only one faith as a portion allotted to all God&rsquo;s redeemed people. In the Old Testament the land of Canaan was the unique good land allotted by God as an inheritance to His people Israel. When the people of Israel entered into the good land and possessed it, that one good land was divided into portions and allotted to each family of the twelve tribes of Israel (Num. 33:51-54). Similarly, there is one great matter which is called faith. God has allotted a portion of this unique faith to each of His chosen people. Thus, we all have the same unique faith. We all have an allotted portion of this one faith.</p>
<p>At the juncture when we believed, it was we who were believing, but it was God who was allotting a portion of the unique faith into us. The name of that unique faith is Jesus Christ. The faith that we have to believe in Christ is Christ Himself (Rom. 3:22; Gal. 2:16a). There is only one Jesus who is faith to us. Therefore, our faith is uniquely one.</p>
<p>We all have the same precious faith in quality, but the quantity of faith that we have depends upon how much we contact the living God so that we may have Him increased in us (Rom. 12:3; Heb. 11:1, 5-6, 27; Col. 2:19). When God increases in us, faith grows in us.</p>
<p>Peter calls the faith, which has been allotted to us through God&rsquo;s exceedingly abundant grace, &ldquo;precious.&rdquo; Faith is precious. It enables us to believe in what we could never believe in, and when it enters into us, it is obtained once and for all and will never leave us. It is impossible for any man to believe in the mystery and centrality of the gospel of God by his natural life. According to human reasoning, it is not believable that the Lord Jesus is God incarnated, was born of a virgin, died to propitiate man&rsquo;s sins, rose from the dead, ascended into the heavens, is seated at the right hand of God, and will return one day. But when this precious faith enters into our being, we can and must believe. The more we believe, the more we feel pleasant and comfortable. Once we obtain this precious faith, it can never be lost. Once we obtain this precious faith, we will never disbelieve. It is impossible for us to truly not believe, even though we may occasionally deny Him, because the precious faith given to us is in us.</p>
<p>Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the things hoped for (Heb. 11:1). The substance of the New Testament blessings is invisible, abstract, and mysterious; it cannot be felt by our emotion or be seen by our eyes. We cannot see the divine life by our natural sight, nor can we sense or touch the divine life by our natural feeling. Furthermore, God Himself, who is the greatest of all the New Testament blessings, is invisible, mysterious, and abstract. None of our physical senses can substantiate Him. In order to substantiate all the New Testament blessings, we need another sense, that is, faith. Faith is the substantiation of the divine, spiritual, and heavenly substance of the New Testament blessings. Faith substantiates God as the main substance of the New Testament blessings. It also substantiates the divine life, the Spirit of God, and the law of the Spirit of life. Faith is an exceedingly great matter. It is not of ourselves; rather, it is a gift granted to us by God and a portion allotted to us by God. If we have the divine faith as our allotted portion, we have all the reality of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with all its blessings.</p>
<p>Faith is also the substantiation of the substance of the truth (v. 1), which is the reality of the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are composed of the &ldquo;all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:3), that is, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as life within and godliness without. The equally precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth. But it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all, with itself (faith), subjective to us in our experience. This can be compared to the scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) being objective to the camera (us). But when the light (the Spirit) brings the scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to the camera.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s plan, is to dispense Himself into our being as our life and life supply. Therefore, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is simply for God&rsquo;s dispensing. This economy has a content, this content has a reality, and this reality is the truth revealed in the Bible. The Bible is not merely a book of doctrine; it is a revelation of the truth, which is the reality of the content of God&rsquo;s economy. This reality has a substance. Only faith can substantiate this substance. Hence, faith is the substantiation of the substance of the reality of the New Testament economy.</p>
<p>This faith is the real portion of God&rsquo;s allotment. It is the reality of the New Testament economy allotted to us in and by the righteousness of God, which is also the righteousness of our Savior, Jesus Christ. This twofold righteousness&mdash;the righteousness of God and of Christ&mdash;is the sphere in which and the means by which the New Testament portion has been allotted to us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Grace and Peace Being Multiplied to Us<br />
in the Full Knowledge of God and of Jesus Our Lord</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:2 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; In this verse there are also two crucial points. The first is related to grace and peace. The words <em>grace to you and peace</em> in verse 2 indicate that grace and peace come to us. After grace and peace come to us, they will be multiplied in the sphere of the full knowledge of God and our Lord and by the means of this full knowledge. Because a wonderful portion&mdash;the Triune God Himself&mdash;has been allotted to us, grace and peace have come to us. Grace is the enjoyment of our portion of the New Testament inheritance, which is actually the processed Triune God. In simple terms, grace is the enjoyment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Peace is the condition that results from grace. To have grace and peace is to have the enjoyment of the Triune God and the issue of this enjoyment. When we enjoy the Triune God, the result is a tranquil condition or situation with both God and man.</p>
<p>The second crucial point in verse 2 concerns the words <em>in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</em> As in verse 1, the preposition <em>in</em> here means &ldquo;in the sphere of, or by means of.&rdquo; Grace and peace come to us in a sphere and by a particular means&mdash;the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature. It is not a mere doctrinal knowledge; it is an experiential knowledge, a knowledge that is full.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;full knowledge&rdquo; is composed of the word <em>gnosis</em> plus the prefix <em>epi,</em> which means &ldquo;upon.&rdquo; This word indicates a thorough, experiential knowledge. This kind of knowledge is not superficial or general. Rather, it is a knowledge that is deep, thorough, and experiential. This is not simply a mental knowledge; it is experiential knowledge in our spiritual understanding and apprehension. The full knowledge of God and of Christ is a deep, practical, thorough, and experiential knowledge of God and our Lord. This full knowledge is both the sphere in which and the means by which the Triune God can be enjoyed by us in order that we may have a peaceful situation with Him and with all men.</p>
<p>Grace and peace came to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the life-blessing of the New Testament (v. 1). This faith was infused into us through the word of God, which conveys to us the real knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. In the sphere of the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, and by means of this increasing and increased knowledge, the grace and peace that we have received will be multiplied.</p>
<p>In his Epistles Paul frequently says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace&rdquo; (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Phil. 1:2). In 2 Peter 1:2, after saying, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace,&rdquo; Peter adds the expression <em>be multiplied.</em> This expression indicates that grace and peace are not light or small; they are within us, multiplying all the time. We need to sense that the divine grace and peace are daily multiplying within us. Moreover, Peter says in verse 2 that grace and peace are multiplied &ldquo;in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; At the end of this Epistle, Peter tells us to grow in the &ldquo;knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&rdquo; (3:18). In a very real sense, we the believers do know God and Jesus, but we need to realize that our knowledge of God and of Jesus may be inadequate. Among a great many believers, there is a great shortage in knowing the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;and His New Testament economy. Multiplication of grace and peace within us is according to the increase of our knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ. We must have the full knowledge of God and Jesus Christ in order that grace and peace in us would be multiplied. For this reason, the burden of the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to help the believers to come to the full knowledge of the Triune God and His economy (1 Tim. 2:4).</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:3 Peter speaks of &ldquo;His divine power.&rdquo; The pronoun <em>His</em> is singular, but in verse 2 there are two antecedents of this pronoun&mdash;<em>God</em> and <em>Jesus our Lord.</em> If we study the Word carefully and properly, we will pay attention to the fact that in verse 2 we have two antecedents for the singular pronoun <em>His</em> in verse 3. This indicates that our Lord Jesus is God Himself and that our God is actually the Lord Jesus. Otherwise, Peter would have said, &ldquo;As Their divine power has granted to us all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have seen that grace is multiplied as His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness. Life is within for us to live, and godliness is without as the outward expression of the inward life. Life is the inward energy, inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness. All things relating to life within and godliness without have already been given to us by the divine power. Now grace must be multiplied according to the giving of this divine power.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(95)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as our God and Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. His Divine Power Having Granted to Us All Things<br />
Which Relate to Life and Godliness,<br />
through the Full Knowledge of Him<br />
Who Has Called Us to His Own Glory and Virtue</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;Seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) His Divine Power</h2>
<p>In verse 3 the word <em>divine</em> denotes the eternal, unlimited, and almighty divinity of God. Hence, divine power is the power of the divine life, which is related to the divine nature. God has given us the marvelous and mysterious divine power. God as the divine power passed through creation, redemption, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This divine power is nothing less than the life-giving Spirit, who is God Himself as life to us in resurrection. The visible things of the creation came into being through God&rsquo;s power. Redemption was also accomplished by the divine power. The one man Jesus could die on behalf of all men to accomplish an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12) because of the divine power. Today as the life-giving Spirit, He offers Himself to us as the divine power in resurrection. When we receive the Lord Jesus, the Triune God enters into us as life in resurrection. This life in resurrection is the divine power, which is God Himself as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>The divine power in 2 Peter 1:3 is the power of the divine life, and this divine life power has given us all things that relate to life and godliness. The things that relate to life are inexhaustible. They include the law of life (Rom. 8:2; Heb. 8:10), humility, wisdom, rejoicing, love, joy, hope, submission, goodness, meekness, kindness, longsuffering, and peace. Everything related to life has been given to us. The life power within the seed of a certain plant includes everything related to the plant&mdash;the stem, branches, leaves, blossoms, flowers, and fruit of the plant. Within the power of the divine life as the seed in us are all the things necessary for the growth of the divine life. In the divine power there are virtues such as love, patience, humility, kindness, and longsuffering. The divine power, the power of life, includes all things needed not only for life inwardly but also for godliness outwardly.</p>
<p>The divine power in 2 Peter 1:3 is the power of the divine life related to the divine nature. It is beyond our ability to measure this divine power. In the realm of human power we are impressed by the kind of power that it took to land a man on the moon. But how much more power was necessary to raise Christ to the third heaven, to the center and height of the universe!</p>
<p>Paul speaks clearly of this divine power in Ephesians 1 when he prays that we would know &ldquo;what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies&rdquo; (vv. 19-20). This divine power has exalted Christ over all and has put everything under His feet. Now Christ is seated on the highest peak of the universe, far above everything on earth and &ldquo;far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named&rdquo; (v. 21). In Ephesians 1 Paul goes on to indicate that the divine power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at God&rsquo;s right hand in the heavenlies, far above all, has been applied to us (v. 22).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Having Granted to Us All Things<br />
Which Relate to Life and Godliness</h2>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:3, Peter says that this divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness. The word <em>granted</em> here means &ldquo;imparted, infused, or planted.&rdquo; All things which relate to life and godliness have been imparted into us, infused into us, by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who regenerates us and indwells us (2 Cor. 3:6, 17; John 3:6; Rom. 8:11).</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; in 2 Peter 1:3 are the various aspects of the divine life, typified by the riches of the produce of the good land in the Old Testament. They are the substance of our faith&rsquo;s substantiation allotted to us by God as our portion for our inheritance. Life is within, enabling us to live, and godliness is without as the outward expression of the inward life. Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to and results in glory.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in verse 3 pertain to the divine life, to <em>zoe,</em> not to the life that is for our pleasure. All things have been given, imparted, and infused into us so that we may live the divine life and also live out this life. The life is inward, but godliness is outward, for it is God Himself expressed. In all our living we should express God. We should testify of God and speak about Him. When God becomes our expression, this is godliness. In our conversation we should express God. If we are expressing God, surely we could not engage in gossip. We should have God in our being and also in our living. Our mind should be filled with Him, and the fiber of our being should be constituted of Him. Then we will have godliness, the outward expression of the inward life.</p>
<p>The imparting into us of all the things of life is through the full knowledge of God, which is conveyed and revealed to us through His word. This becomes the faith (objective), in which our faith (subjective) is produced.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) Through the Full Knowledge of Him<br />
Who Has Called Us by His Own Glory and Virtue</h2>
<p>In verse 3 Peter says that the divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness &ldquo;through the full knowledge of Him.&rdquo; This full knowledge is a deep, thorough, experiential knowledge.</p>
<p>The preposition <em>through</em> used in relation to full knowledge indicates that we need to pass through a process. If we have the practice of gossiping, this practice is an indication that we have not yet passed through the process leading to the full knowledge of the One who has called us. If we have the full knowledge of the One who has called us to His glory and virtue, we will not waste our time gossiping.</p>
<p>The divine power has infused us with all things pertaining to life and godliness. However, this infusion, this impartation, requires that we have the full knowledge of God. If we do not pass through the process to gain the full knowledge, it will seem that what the divine power has planted in us has been in vain. The divine power is operating, but there is the need for us to cooperate with this operation. There is the need for us to be trained by the Lord so that we may gain the full knowledge of the One who has called us.</p>
<p>In verse 3 Peter does not speak of the knowledge of God nor of the knowledge of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Instead, he speaks of the full knowledge of the One who has called us to His glory and virtue. Here Peter does not say that God has called us to heaven, nor even that He has called us to redemption or sanctification. In this verse Peter says that God has called us to His own glory and virtue. We need to have the full knowledge of this. We can know the One who has called us to His own glory and virtue only by passing through a long process.</p>
<p>We definitely need the full knowledge of the One who has called us for the purpose of bringing us into His glory and virtue. If we have such an experiential knowledge of Him, the divine power will operate in us effectively. For the divine power to work in us, we daily need to cooperate with God. In the morning we should open to Him and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am here before You. Go on, Lord. I would not hinder You. Rather, I would give You a free way within me. Lord, whatever You speak to me I will proclaim.&rdquo; The more we cooperate with the divine power within us, the more we are brought into God&rsquo;s glory, enjoy His virtue, and express this virtue as godliness.</p>
<p>Glory is the expression of God, God expressed in splendor. Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; means &ldquo;excellency,&rdquo; denoting the energy of life that enables us to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all excellent attributes. Glory is the divine goal; virtue is the energy and strength of life that enable us to reach the goal. This virtue, with all things relating to life, has been given to us by the divine power, but it needs to be developed on the way to glory.</p>
<p>God has called us to His glory and virtue, but this calling needs to be worked out. Although we have been called into God&rsquo;s glory and virtue, are we actually in this glory, and are we participating in this virtue? The truth is that sometimes we are in the glory, and sometimes we participate in this virtue. God&rsquo;s calling us to His glory and virtue can be worked out through His precious promises (v. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. On the Basis of His Glory and Virtue<br />
He Having Granted to Us Precious and<br />
Exceedingly Great Promises, That through These<br />
We Might Become Partakers of the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:4 goes on to say, &ldquo;Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;through&rdquo; in this verse means &ldquo;on account of, on the basis of.&rdquo; The Greek word has an instrumental sense, but here it also denotes cause. The relative pronoun <em>which</em> in 2 Peter 1:4 refers to glory and virtue in verse 3. Through and on the basis of the Lord&rsquo;s glory and virtue, by and to which we have been called, He has given us His precious and exceedingly great promises, such as in Matthew 28:20; John 6:57; 7:38-39; 10:28-29; 14:19-20, 23; 15:5; and 16:13-15. All these promises are being carried out in His believers by His life-power as the excellent virtue, unto His glory.</p>
<p>According to 2 Peter 1:3, the Lord has called us not only by His glory and virtue but also to His glory and virtue. The disciples saw the Lord&rsquo;s glory and virtue. During the time He was with them, they saw the virtue in His conduct and daily living. They also saw His glory on the Mount of Transfiguration. They saw the Lord&rsquo;s glory at other times as well, for example, when He fed the five thousand and when He called Lazarus out of the tomb. Having seen the Lord&rsquo;s glory and virtue, the disciples were attracted. This means that they were called by the Lord&rsquo;s glory and virtue. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, Peter was full of glory and virtue. The disciples were in a situation that was full of glory and full of virtue, the glory and virtue to which they had been called.</p>
<p>Through this glory and virtue God has given us promises. This means that because of the glory and virtue, God has given us the precious and exceedingly great promises. Because we all have been called to glory and virtue, God has given us promises in order that He may work out this virtue and glory for us.</p>
<p>The impartation into us of all things which relate to life and godliness is through the full knowledge of God, the One who has called us by and to His own glory and virtue. How can we live a life that expresses God as our godliness? We live it through knowing Him. Therefore, we need to know the One who has called us by and to His glory and virtue. Furthermore, through this glory and virtue He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises. By these promises He assures us that He will work out the virtue so that we may reach His glory.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) Partakers of the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:4 speaks of the &ldquo;partakers of the divine nature.&rdquo; This is the highlight of Peter&rsquo;s ministry. As those who have received equally precious faith, we, the believers in Christ, should be partakers of the divine nature. For God to be our life is a deep subject, but for God&rsquo;s nature to be our nature is an even deeper matter.</p>
<p>The divine nature refers to what God is, that is, the riches, the elements, and the constituents of God&rsquo;s being (John 4:24; 1 John 1:5; 4:8, 16). The divine nature, which mainly refers to the constitution of the divine life, the constitution of God, is constituted with Spirit, love, and light. The divine life and the divine nature are inseparable; the divine nature is the substance of the divine life and is within the divine life (1:1-2; 5:11-13). As the children of God, we are God-men, born of God, possessing the life and nature of God, and belonging to the species of God (3:1; John 1:12-13). At our regeneration, another nature was imparted into us; this is the nature of God, the divine nature. Because the divine nature is in the divine life, the divine life with which we were born again has the divine nature within it (3:3, 5-6, 15). Whoever believes into the Son of God is born of God and has the right to become a child of God; thus, a believer has the right to partake of, to enjoy, the nature of God (1:12-13).</p>
<p>Through incarnation Christ put humanity upon Himself and thereafter had two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. Through His resurrection and through coming into us as the Spirit, Christ has brought divinity into us. Therefore, we also have two natures, the human nature and the divine nature. By being born of the Spirit, we have become partakers of the divine nature. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, just as You have two natures, so we have two natures also. You are divine and human, and we are human and divine. We are the same as You! Lord, You have our nature, and we have Yours. You are both divine and human, and we are both human and divine. Lord, You are the Son of God, and we are sons of God.&rdquo; By our first birth we partook of the human nature. Now that we have been begotten of God by the new birth, we partake of the divine nature. Our status is both human and divine. We are not merely sons of man but sons of God as well.</p>
<p>We, the sons of God, have all become partakers of the divine nature. To us, God is no longer merely the creating God but also the begetting Father. He has imparted His life, His nature, and even His being into our being. God the Father has become our nature and life. Because we have been born of God, in life and nature we are the same as God. In other words, we are God in life and in nature but not in His Godhead. On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that the Godhead is unique and that only God, who alone has the Godhead, should be worshipped. On the other hand, the New Testament reveals that we, the believers in Christ, have God&rsquo;s life and nature and that we are becoming God in life and in nature but will never have His Godhead. Regeneration does not make us part of the Godhead. To say that believers become part of the Godhead as objects of worship is to blaspheme God. We cannot share in the Godhead, but we can partake of the divine nature. What a great blessing it is to be one with God in His life and nature!</p>
<p>The greatest blessing in the universe is that we can partake of God&rsquo;s nature. The Christian life is a life of enjoying the divine nature. We are partaking of the divine elements of God&rsquo;s being. A partaker of the divine nature is one who enjoys and participates in the divine nature. If we would be partakers of the divine nature, we need to live by the divine life within which is the divine nature (1:4; 10:10; 11:25; 6:57b). We live the divine life by God&rsquo;s promises. In order that we may enjoy all that He is, God will do many things for us according to His promises. We need to live by the divine life so that we may be partakers of the divine nature. Although we received the divine life at the time we believed, the divine nature must be continually enjoyed by us. This enjoyment requires the grace of God. God&rsquo;s sufficient grace will work within us day by day so that we may enjoy the divine nature. The more we enjoy the divine nature, the more we have His virtue, and the more we are brought into His glory.</p>
<p>The riches of what God is are the content of the living hope mentioned in 1 Peter 1:3. According to His great mercy, God the Father has regenerated us unto a living hope. This living hope is actually a hope of life. Having this hope of life, we expect to enjoy daily the riches of the divine life. Actually, to enjoy the divine life is simply to partake of the divine nature. Therefore, partaking of the divine nature is related to our living hope of enjoying all the riches of the divine life.</p>
<p>When we were regenerated, we were enlivened by God. The divine life came into the center of our being. From that time onward, we have had a living hope, a hope of life. Our hope is that every part of our being will be enlivened. Regeneration, therefore, has brought in a living hope. Regeneration is unto the enjoyment of the riches of the divine life, and the riches of this life are the divine nature. Hence, to partake of the divine nature is to enjoy the riches of God.</p>
<p>When we received the divine life and were regenerated, we became a new being&mdash;a partaker of the divine nature. The expression <em>partakers of the divine nature</em> in 2 Peter 1:4 indicates that the Triune God is our portion. If God were not our portion, we could not partake of His nature. Every day we should partake of the divine nature. Our partaking of the divine nature must be constant, not occasional. In our Christian life, we must eat, drink, and even breathe the divine nature.</p>
<p>The matter of nature is very important. Hens lay eggs because it is according to their nature. The apple tree and all fruit trees bring forth fruit also by and according to their natures. This means that if we have a particular nature, we are able to do things that are by and according to that nature, and if we do not have a certain nature, we are not able to do things that are according to that nature. As believers in Christ, we have God&rsquo;s nature. We desire to be holy, godly, and spiritual because these things are according to God&rsquo;s nature, of which we partake. To do the things of God is natural to us because the divine things are according to the divine nature within us.</p>
<p>We have the divine nature within. The divine nature means everything in our Christian life. Since we have the divine nature, we do not need outward regulations to adjust our hair, clothes, and behavior. Any adjustments that we make should be made according to the divine nature within. Everything we do, say, and are should be checked with the divine nature. Every newborn child has the human nature. While little babies do not have any knowledge of outward regulations, they still have the human nature that regulates what they eat. You do not need to teach them about sweet and bitter because they have the human nature with its human taste. As Christians, we have a nature that is much higher than the human nature. We have the divine nature with a divine taste. We must live a life that matches the divine nature within us.</p>
<p>Since we have the life of God, we also have the nature of God. The emphasis on life is on the capacity to live, and the emphasis on nature is on the inclination of our living. We desire to be heavenly because the nature of God, the inclination of God, is heavenly. We desire to be holy because God&rsquo;s nature and inclination are holy. We feel uneasy when we are proud, and we feel comfortable when we are humble because this is the nature and inclination of God. We feel uneasy when we take advantage of others and very happy when we share with others, because this is God&rsquo;s nature and inclination. These are all matters of nature and inclination. If we realize that the divine nature within us has a particular taste, we will see that it is easy to be freed from the world and not love sin and evil. God is in us not only as our life but also as our nature. Within us He is the capacity to live, and He has also become our taste in our living. His life and nature in us make it very easy for us not to love the world and to overcome sins and evil.</p>
<p>If we enjoy God and partake of the riches of His being, we will be constituted with the divine nature, becoming the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead and expressing Him in all that we are and do. If we partake of God day by day, eventually we will partake of Him unconsciously. We all should be fully saturated with the nature of God. The more we are saturated with God, the more we will express Him. When others contact us, they will see in us the expression of the Triune God. We may even give off a divine fragrance.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the divine nature is both for the present and for eternity. For eternity we will continue to partake of the divine nature. This is illustrated by the tree of life and the river of water of life in Revelation 22:1 and 2. The river of life flows out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. This signifies God flowing out to be the enjoyment of His redeemed ones. That flowing river will saturate the entire city of New Jerusalem. Furthermore, the tree of life that grows along the river will supply the redeemed ones with God as their life supply. This is a picture of what it means to partake of the divine nature. To eat the fruit of the tree of life is to partake of God&rsquo;s nature; to be partakers of the divine nature is to be the eaters of the tree of life. God&rsquo;s nature is holy, loving, righteous, kind, and pure. Actually, God&rsquo;s nature is all-inclusive. The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we have holiness, love, righteousness, kindness, and all manner of divine attributes. These attributes then become our virtues, which eventually will consummate in God&rsquo;s glory. We should praise the Lord that we human beings can have God&rsquo;s life, enjoy God&rsquo;s nature, live as God lives, express Him as our godliness, and have all the excellent virtues that will consummate in glory.</p>
<p>In his second Epistle, the apostle Peter unveils the energy, the strength, by which the believers are enabled to escape the corruption in lust and the result of that escape. The energy is the virtue of the divine life, and the result is that the believers partake of the divine nature and thus enjoy all the riches of what the Triune God is. In our partaking of the divine nature and in our enjoying of all that God is, all the riches of the divine nature will be fully developed, as described in verses 5 through 7 of chapter 1. Having escaped the corruption of lust in the world and having thus removed the barriers to the growth of the divine life in us, we are freed to become partakers of the divine nature and to enjoy its riches to the fullest extent in its development by the virtue of God unto His glory. Day after day we must partake of the divine nature, which is the glory. Eventually, this divine nature will glorify us, causing us to shine with God&rsquo;s element. We were made children of God and sons of God in order to be partakers of the divine nature so that we may be glorified with the divine glory (v. 4; Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10).</p>
<p>It is a wonderful fact that as believers we possess the divine nature. The way to enlarge the sphere of the divine nature within us is to take the word of Christ not only by reading but also by praying, singing, psalming, and thanking the Lord (Col. 3:16). If the word of Christ is to dwell in us richly, we need to open our entire being and exercise our spirit. Then the word of Christ will enter into us, stir us up, and become mingled with us, causing us to be one with the Lord in an actual and practical way. As a result, the sphere of the divine nature in us will be enlarged.</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:4 there is a condition for becoming partakers of the divine nature: the condition is &ldquo;having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&rdquo; Lust is a barrier that keeps us from enjoying the divine nature. Christ died to redeem us from the vain manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18-19), and now, as redeemed ones, we should abstain from fleshly lusts (2:11) and no longer live in the flesh in the lusts of men (4:2). This is to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. The more we escape this corruption, the more we will enjoy the nature of God. Likewise, the more we partake of the divine nature, the more we will escape the corruption that is in the world by lust. This is a cycle of escaping and partaking and of partaking and escaping. If this cycle of partaking and escaping works within us in a strong, rapid way, it will be difficult for us to take in any of the corruption of the world. We partake of the divine nature, and this divine nature strengthens us to stay away from corruption. Then the more we stay away from the corruption of the world, the more we enjoy the riches of the divine nature. This is the experience of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>In brief, we should partake of the divine nature and enjoy what God is, the contents, the ingredients, of His being. By what way do we enjoy the divine nature? First, we enjoy the divine nature by the full knowledge of the One who has called us by His glory and virtue and to His glory and virtue. Because of this, He has given us many precious and exceedingly great promises. Second, we need to escape the corruption which is in the world by lust; that is, we need to abstain from lustful living. Indulging the lusts of the flesh annuls our right to enjoy God&rsquo;s nature. But if we escape the corruption which is in the world by lust, we will cooperate with the God who is now operating in us according to His promises to carry out His virtue and glory. If we cooperate with God&rsquo;s operation, we will become those who enjoy the divine nature.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Precious and Exceedingly Great Promises</h2>
<p>Through the precious and exceedingly great promises we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him, into which we have entered through faith and baptism (John 3:15; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19). The virtue (energy of life) of this divine nature carries us into His glory (godliness becoming the full expression of the Triune God).</p>
<p>Based upon the glory and virtue to which we have been called by God, He gives us promises. He promises us that He will be responsible to work out this glory and virtue. As we have seen, glory as the expression is the goal, and virtue is the energy of life. Virtue is the excellent attributes of God becoming to us the energy of life. This means that we have the energy and strength to reach glory. By God&rsquo;s promises we have the energy to express His glory.</p>
<p>God has called us to His own glory and virtue. This goal is great, vast, and profound. Who is able to reach God&rsquo;s own glory and virtue? None of us is able to arrive at this goal. Therefore, there is the need of God&rsquo;s word of promise to assure us, encourage us, strengthen us, and speed us on our way toward this goal. Knowing our need for assurance, encouragement, and strength, God has given us precious and exceedingly great promises.</p>
<p>We cannot reach the high goal of God&rsquo;s glory and virtue by ourselves. For this, we need the Lord. Because we do not know what lies ahead of us, God has given us precious promises. One of these great promises is in Matthew 28:20: &ldquo;Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; No doubt, this promise was an encouragement to all the disciples.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s promises encouraged Peter and the other disciples on their way toward the goal of God&rsquo;s glory and virtue. When Peter and the eleven stood up to preach on the day of Pentecost, God&rsquo;s glory and virtue were with them. The disciples manifested divine virtues, not natural human virtues. In Acts 3 a lame man looked to Peter and John for a gift of money. Peter said to him, &ldquo;Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk&rdquo; (v. 6). Then Peter took him by the hand and lifted him up, and immediately the lame man was healed. &ldquo;Leaping up and about, he stood and began to walk, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God&rdquo; (v. 8). On that occasion, they manifested God&rsquo;s virtue and glory. This was carried out by the promise of the Lord that He would be with them all the days until the completion of this age. By means of the Lord&rsquo;s promises the early disciples were encouraged to press on to reach God&rsquo;s glory and attain the divine virtues.</p>
<p>The New Testament is filled with promises. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12 that he had a thorn in his flesh that caused him to suffer. He prayed three times to the Lord that the thorn might depart from him. But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness&rdquo; (vv. 7-9). This shows us that the Lord&rsquo;s grace and power were sufficient to sustain and supply Paul and to bring him through these sufferings and difficulties. Therefore, Paul said that he would rather boast in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him. The original meaning of the word <em>tabernacle</em> here is &ldquo;to fix a tent or a habitation upon something.&rdquo; This portrays the power of Christ, which is Christ Himself, being like a tent tabernacling over us, overshadowing our weaknesses.</p>
<p>Every time we feel heavily burdened, we need to listen to the Lord&rsquo;s voice saying, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you. My power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; If we consider ourselves to be strong, then we will not be able to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s power. Therefore, our weakness is precious. It is due to our weaknesses that the Lord&rsquo;s power has the ground to manifest itself, and we are able to enjoy His power. God&rsquo;s sufficient grace will work within us day by day so that we may enjoy the divine nature.</p>
<p>The promises in 2 Peter 1:4 are mainly related to our spiritual life. These are promises for the inner life and the outward expression of life. One such promise is in Ephesians 3:20, which says, &ldquo;To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us.&rdquo; This promise to do above all that we ask or think does not concern the material things of the present life but the spiritual things for the church life. The Lord will do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church life, according to the inner working power that operates in us.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are great promises, which clearly indicate that our experience of God involves our enjoyment of the divine nature within us in order that His divine nature would become our enjoyment. For example, 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse contains a great promise that God would sanctify us wholly, that is, our spirit, soul, and body. By this promise we may enjoy the holy divine nature which we have within us. We may be careless concerning holiness because although we have received the divine nature, we may not enjoy it. Yet when we read the great promise in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are helped, encouraged, and strengthened to live a holy life. Upon reading this verse, we are assured by the promise that God will sanctify us both in our daily walk and in our tripartite being&mdash;our spirit, soul, and body. Consequently, we would be careful in the details of our daily walk in order to live a holy life. This is our experience of the enjoyment of the divine nature on the basis of a great promise given to us by God.</p>
<p>Another great promise of God is found in 2 Corinthians 6:16 through 7:1, which says, &ldquo;What agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, &lsquo;I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.&rsquo; Therefore &lsquo;come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you&rsquo;; &lsquo;and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.&rsquo; Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&rdquo; Holiness is separation unto God from all things other than Him (Rom. 1:1-2; Eph. 1:4). To perfect holiness is to make this separation full and perfect, to have our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;fully and perfectly separated, sanctified, unto God (1 Thes. 5:23). A believer who loves the Lord and reads this portion of the Word may be helped, encouraged, and strengthened to live a holy life that matches God&rsquo;s holy nature. On the basis of the great promise in this passage, he would certainly enjoy the holy divine nature that is in him.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 9:6-10 also contains great promises of God. Here Paul says, &ldquo;Take note of this: He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap; each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work; even as it is written, &lsquo;He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.&rsquo; Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase.&rdquo; In this passage we see at least two great promises. On the one hand, if we sow with blessings, we will reap with blessings, for God will bountifully supply seed to us. On the other hand, if we sow sparingly, we will reap sparingly. Consequently, we will be unable to enjoy the generous divine nature within us and to see God&rsquo;s blessing in His generosity. Based upon these promises, may we learn to be the partakers of the divine nature, those who enjoy the divine nature always, not occasionally.</p>
<p>When we spend time reading this portion of the Word prayerfully, we will be stirred up to give according to the generous divine nature of God. God is full of generosity and liberality; generosity is a characteristic of God&rsquo;s divine nature. When we dwell on this passage, we will be encouraged and reminded to give generously according to the divine nature within us. As a result, we will begin to practice generosity, thereby enjoying the generous divine nature.</p>
<p>To partake of the divine nature is to enjoy the divine nature, and to enjoy the divine nature is to enjoy God Himself, that is, to enjoy all that God is. The entire New Testament is a book of precious and exceedingly great promises. Every portion of the New Testament is a promise that the Triune God will do everything for us to enjoy Himself as the divine nature.</p>
<p>The precious promises are embodied in the divine Word. By pray-reading the promises, we partake of and enjoy the divine nature, and by partaking of the divine nature we develop in the divine life. The more we pray-read the promises, the more we enjoy the divine nature, and the more we enjoy the divine nature, the more we grow and develop in the divine life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">f. Our Being Richly and Bountifully Supplied<br />
the Entrance into His Eternal Kingdom</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:11 says, &ldquo;In this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you.&rdquo; The eternal kingdom in this verse refers to the kingdom of God, which was given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (Dan. 7:13-14) and which will be manifested at His coming back (Luke 19:11-12). It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God&rsquo;s glory (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6). To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God&rsquo;s eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ (1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12).</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we see that the development of the kingdom within us is actually our entrance into the kingdom. In verses 3 and 4 Peter speaks of the divine power granting to us all things which relate to life and godliness and of becoming partakers of the divine nature. Then in verses 5 through 11 we have the development through growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom.</p>
<p>In verses 5 through 7 Peter says, &ldquo;Adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness; and in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.&rdquo; Here we see the development of the divine life in us through a number of steps. Then in verse 11 Peter concludes, &ldquo;For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bountiful supply that we enjoy in the development of the divine life and divine nature (vv. 3-7) will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord. It will enable and qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom by all the riches of the divine life and divine nature as our excellent virtues (energy) unto the splendid glory of God. This is not merely to be saved but, after being saved, to pursue the growth and maturity in the divine life and thereby receive the kingdom reward.</p>
<p>The entrance into the kingdom is a matter of the development of the divine life within us. The growing of Christ within us is our entering into the kingdom. The reason that the growth of Christ in us is our entrance into the kingdom is that this growing is the developing of the kingdom. As we develop the kingdom, we enter into it.</p>
<p>We cannot simply walk into the kingdom; we must grow and develop into the kingdom. The secret of entering into the kingdom is simply to grow in life. The seed of life is already within us; it simply needs to grow and develop. We enter the kingdom day by day by the growth of the inner life.</p>
<p>Since the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received a little seed sown into us. Actually, there is no need for us to grow so fast. We need to simply go to the Lord, open to Him, enjoy Him, thank Him, and praise Him. Thank the Lord that He has sown Himself into us and that He is growing and spreading within us. If we sow a carnation seed into the ground, we do not need to pray and fast. We simply need to sow the seed properly and then go home and rest. Occasionally, we need to come and water the seed. It will grow without our effort. Likewise, to enter into the kingdom we simply need to grow in life and grow in grace. To enter into the kingdom we need the maturity of life, the full growth of life.</p>
<p>How can the kingdom develop within us? If we would have the kingdom develop in us, we need to humble ourselves, empty ourselves, and unload ourselves. We should not be occupied with culture, religion, ethics, morality, philosophy, improvement of character, or the effort to be spiritual, scriptural, holy, and victorious. We should care only for Christ and for the growth of Christ within us. All the ground within us should be made available for Him to grow in us. The entrance into the kingdom is supplied to us by the Lord through our growth in His life and through the development of this life within us.</p>
<p>We also can have a rich entrance by losing our soul today (Matt. 16:25-28). When we lose our soul and its enjoyment, we are undergoing transformation. The losing of the soul today actually transforms the soul, but the saving of our soul today frustrates the transformation. If we lose our soul in all things related to our daily living, we will gradually be transformed. The more we lose the enjoyment of the soul, the richer an entrance we will have.</p>
<p>According to 2 Peter 1:1-4, God has given the seed of faith, the growing power, and He has given the promises that He will send the rain, the growth, and the harvest if we cooperate with Him. With God&rsquo;s giving, we must be diligent to develop the seed of faith by taking the promises, by receiving His word. The best way to receive His word is to pray-read the word. The more we pray-read all the promises, the more we will enjoy the divine nature. As we enjoy this divine nature, we have the growth in life, the maturity in life, and the harvest of life. This maturity is the entrance into the kingdom of the Lord Jesus. We all need to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">g. His Coming in Power, Majesty, and Glory<br />
as the Beloved Son of God<br />
Revealed on the Holy Mountain</h2>
<p>In order to bring us into the eternal kingdom, Christ will come in power, majesty, and glory as the beloved Son of God revealed on the holy mountain. Verses 16 through 18 say, &ldquo;We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One&rsquo;s majesty. For He received from God the Father honor and glory, a voice such as this being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My Son, My Beloved, in whom I delight. And this voice we heard being borne out of heaven while we were with Him in the holy mountain.&rdquo; Myths were the superstitious stories cleverly devised in Greek philosophy, which was related to the apostasy. The apostles preached and taught concerning the power and coming (Gk. <em>parousia,</em> presence) of the Lord Jesus Christ. To unbelievers, the preaching concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming sounded very much like a myth or a superstitious tale. But here Peter says that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when they made known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Concerning the word <em>eyewitnesses,</em> Darby comments, &ldquo;&lsquo;Admitted into immediate vision of the glory,&rsquo; a word used for full initiation into the mysteries.&rdquo; Peter realized that he, James, and John had been admitted into the highest degree of initiation at the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty. He considered the transfiguration of the Lord a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36. The Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration in glory was a fact, and he was in it. The Lord&rsquo;s coming back in glory also will be a fact, as real as the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration, and he will be in it as well.</p>
<p>Peter says that the apostles became eyewitnesses of the Lord&rsquo;s majesty. This majesty denotes magnificence, greatness in splendor, honor, and glory, even magnificent glory (2 Pet. 1:17), as that which appeared to the eyes of Peter and the other two disciples in the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2; Luke 9:32).</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:16 Peter indicates that the Lord Jesus will come back in glory. This is not a tale or a myth. Even when He was on earth, the glory came out of Him, and He was transfigured. Peter, James, and John saw His majesty when they were with Him on the mountain. They were eyewitnesses and were initiated into a vision of His glory.</p>
<p>Verse 17 tells us that Christ received from God the Father honor and glory. Honor is a matter of position, and glory is a matter of state. On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Lord was in a position of honor and in a state of glory.</p>
<p>Peter says that a voice was borne to the Lord by the magnificent glory. This magnificent glory denotes the overshadowing cloud at the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration (Luke 9:34-35), like the shekinah glory overshadowing the expiation cover (Exo. 25:20; 40:34).</p>
<p>If we read the accounts in Matthew, Mark, and Luke concerning the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration, we will see that the magnificent glory in 2 Peter 1:17 refers to the overshadowing cloud. Peter, James, and John saw the cloud, and that cloud was the glory. Likewise, after the tabernacle had been erected in ancient times, it was filled with the glory of God, for the cloud of God&rsquo;s glory overshadowed the tabernacle. It would have been difficult to discern the cloud from the glory, because the cloud was with the glory.</p>
<h2 class="head3">111. The Master</h2>
<p>Second Peter 2:1 says, &ldquo;There arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.&rdquo; Here Peter speaks of Christ as &ldquo;the Master&rdquo; who &ldquo;bought&rdquo; the believers. The word <em>Master</em> implies the Lord&rsquo;s person and His redemptive work (Jude 4; 2 Tim. 2:21; Rev. 6:10). The false teachers at Peter&rsquo;s time, like today&rsquo;s modernists in their apostasy, denied both the person of the Lord as the Master and His redemption, by which the Lord purchased the believers (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:20; 7:23; Rev. 5:9; 14:3-4). The false teachers despised the lordship of Christ and were made slaves of corruption (2 Pet. 2:10, 19). In contrast to the false teachers, we need to escape &ldquo;the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&rdquo; (v. 20). This indicates the importance of having the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Master who bought us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">112. The Element of Our Growth</h2>
<p>In 2 Peter 3:18, Peter tells us to &ldquo;grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse reveals Christ as the element of our growth. The word <em>grow</em> in verse 18 indicates that what Peter wrote in his two Epistles is a matter of life (1 Pet. 2:2; Eph. 4:15; Col. 2:19). To grow in grace is to grow by the bountiful supply of eternal life provided by the divine power (2 Pet. 1:3-4), and to grow in the knowledge of the Lord is to grow by the realization of what Christ is. This is to grow by the enjoyment of grace and the realization of truth (John 1:14).</p>
<p>Grace is the Triune God being life and the life supply to us. We need to grow in this life supply, in this nourishment. Therefore, to grow in grace means to grow in this inward source of the supply of life. At the beginning of this Epistle, Peter speaks of grace, and now at the end he charges us to grow in this grace.</p>
<p>Grace is God Himself with divinity processed through incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension. All these elements of grace are within us to be one with us. Grace is God Himself as our life to be one with us, to save us, to make His home in us, and to be formed in us. To grow in grace is to grow in the increase of God. Grace is God&rsquo;s visitation to us to stay in us and make Himself one with us. We need to grow in such a grace for His glory today and unto the day of eternity. Second Peter 3:18 is the concluding word of the apostle Peter&rsquo;s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God.</p>
<p>Verse 18 tells us to &ldquo;grow in the grace.&rdquo; This indicates that to grow is by the feeding and watering, as revealed by Peter in 1 Peter 2:2 and by Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:2 and 6. To grow in grace is to grow in the enjoyment of all that Christ is to us as our spiritual food and living water. All the riches of what Christ is to us are for our growth in life. The more we enjoy the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8), the more we will grow in life (4:15).</p>
<p>Peter also encourages us to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The realization of the knowledge of our Lord equals truth, the reality of all that He is, as in John 1:14 and 17. Peter charged the believers to grow not only in grace but also in this truth. The full knowledge of Jesus Christ, knowing Christ in a deeper and fuller way, helps us to grow and develop. Both in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the believers should grow unto His glory both now and unto the day of eternity.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED NINETY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(97)</h1>
<p>In this message we begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Epistles of John.</p>
<h2 class="head3">113. The Word of Life</h2>
<p>In 1 John 1:1-7 we see Christ as the Word of life. First John 1:1 says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life.&rdquo; The Word of life in this verse is the Word mentioned in John 1:1-4 and 14, who was with God and was God in eternity before creation, who became flesh in time, and in whom is life. This Word conveys the eternal life and is the divine person of Christ as an account, a definition, and an expression of all that God is. In Him is life, and He is life (11:25; 14:6). The phrase <em>the Word of life</em> in Greek indicates that the Word is life. The person is the divine life, the eternal life, which we can touch.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Eternal Life Itself</h2>
<p>First John 1:2 continues, &ldquo;And the life was manifested.&rdquo; This indicates that <em>life</em> is a synonym for <em>Word of life</em> in the preceding verse. Both denote the divine person of Christ, who was with the Father in eternity and was manifested in time through incarnation, and whom the apostles saw and testified and reported to the believers. Christ as the Word of life is the eternal life itself for our experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Greek words rendered &ldquo;the eternal life&rdquo; literally mean &ldquo;the life the eternal.&rdquo; This life denotes the divine spiritual life, not the human soulish life or the physical life (Rom. 5:17). <em>Eternal</em> denotes not only duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God. The apostles saw this eternal life and testified and reported it to people. Their experience was not of any doctrine but of Christ, the Son of God, as the eternal life, and their testimony and preaching were not of theology or biblical knowledge but of such a solid life.</p>
<p>The eternal life is an indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Nothing can destroy or dissolve this life. It is an endless life, being the eternal, divine, uncreated life, and the resurrection life which has passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). Satan and his followers thought that they had terminated this life by crucifying it. The religious leaders had a similar concept. However, crucifixion gave this life the best opportunity to be multiplied, to be propagated (John 12:24). Because this life is unlimited, it can never be conquered, subdued, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Eternal life is the life of God (Eph. 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:3). We may say that this life is actually God Himself with the contents of divine love and divine light. And this life is of the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:2), especially when it becomes our life for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Eternal life is also the Son of God. This life is not simply a matter or a thing; this life is a person. The divine life is God Himself expressed in His Son. First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life.&rdquo; In our experience we know that eternal life is the Son of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. His Being with the Father from the Beginning,<br />
Being Manifested to the Apostles,<br />
and Being Reported to the Believers</h2>
<p>First John 1:2 goes on to say, &ldquo;We have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ as the Word of life is in three stages. First, He was with the Father from the beginning, that is, from eternity past; second, He was manifested to the apostles through His incarnation and human living on earth; third, He was reported to the believers.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;with&rdquo; in verse 2 implies living and acting in union and communion with. The eternal life, which is the Son, not only was with the Father but also was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity. This word corresponds with John 1:1-2. The source of the eternal life is the Father, from whom and with whom the Son was manifested as the expression of the eternal life for those, whom the Father has chosen, to partake of and enjoy this life.</p>
<p>This manifestation of the eternal life was through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, which John stressed strongly in his Gospel (1:14) as an antidote to inoculate the believers against the heresy which said that Christ did not come in the flesh. Such a manifestation, corresponding with being touchable, indicates again the substantial nature of the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, which is the manifestation of the divine life in the New Testament economy. The manifestation of the eternal life includes the revelation and impartation of life to man, with a view to bringing man into the eternal life, into its union and communion with the Father.</p>
<p>This Word is the Word of life. God is life, the Word, which is God, is life to us, and this life was manifested. This life is the Lord Jesus Christ. When He was manifested in the flesh, He was manifested as life. If we prayerfully consider the record in the four Gospels with all the stories recorded concerning Jesus, we can see that in His human living, life was always manifested. The Lord Jesus was a person who manifested life. The disciples, including John, saw that life. Therefore, John could testify and report to us the eternal life which was with the Father. Today if we read the Word prayerfully, we will receive the benefit of the manifestation of eternal life.</p>
<p>The apostles saw eternal life, the life that was manifested, and then testified and reported this life to the believers. What they reported was not some theology or doctrine which they had heard and been taught, but the divine life, which they had seen and testified by their practical experiences.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have come that they may have life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (6:35; 10:10; 14:6). John indicated that the Lord Jesus is this life and that he saw, heard, handled, and was made sure of Him; then John reported this eternal life to us. He did not report merely by speaking and preaching about it, but he conveyed and transmitted it into us.</p>
<p>The apostles preached the eternal life, which they had heard, seen, and handled. This shows us that the ministry in the early days was a ministry of life. The preaching, teaching, and ministry of the apostles were to preach life, teach life, and minister life. The preaching of the gospel is the declaration of life as a person to people. It is not the passing on of doctrine or knowledge but the proclamation of a person who is life.</p><h2 class="head4">c. That the Believers Might Have Fellowship<br />
with the Apostles, Whose Fellowship Is<br />
with the Father and with the Son</h2>
<p>First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The apostles reported the eternal life to the believers in order that the believers might have fellowship with the apostles whose fellowship is with the Father and with the Son. This means that through the enjoyment of the eternal life, which is the Word of life, we can have fellowship with the apostles and with the Father and the Son. Eternal life produces fellowship. When this life is reported, the result is the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; means &ldquo;joint participation, common participation.&rdquo; Fellowship is the issue of the eternal life and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life. It is illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1). All genuine believers are in this fellowship (Acts 2:42). It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called &ldquo;the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14) and &ldquo;fellowship of [our] spirit&rdquo; (Phil. 2:1). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we, the believers, participate in all that the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). Such a fellowship was first the apostles&rsquo; portion in their enjoyment of the Father and the Son through the Spirit. Hence, in Acts 2:42 it is called &ldquo;the fellowship of the apostles,&rdquo; and in 1 John 1:3 &ldquo;our [the apostles&rsquo;] fellowship,&rdquo; a fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. It is a divine mystery.</p>
<p>The apostle John is reporting to us that which he saw and heard. He had heard, seen, and even handled the Word of life, the eternal life. Now he is testifying and reporting to us the eternal life. Then John goes on to say that he reported what he had seen and heard, not that we might have &ldquo;life&rdquo; but that we might have &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; In other words, what the apostles declare to the believers is the life, but what the believers have is the fellowship. If the believers receive the life that the apostles declare to them, they will have the fellowship. This indicates that the fellowship comes from the life.</p>
<p>In the divine life the believers have fellowship with one another (v. 7; Phil. 2:1). As the electric lights in the ceiling of a room have a current flowing within them, so we all have the divine current flowing within us. Fellowship is simply the flowing of the divine life within us. When life stands still, it is life; when it flows, it is fellowship. In this divine life and through this divine life we have fellowship for the enjoyment of the divine life. The more we have the divine life flowing within us, the more we enjoy the divine life.</p>
<p>This fellowship is in the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). Since the Spirit is the realization of Christ, when the Spirit is in us, Christ and God are in us. The Spirit in all of us is one and the same. The Spirit in one believer is the Spirit in another believer. There is one Spirit in all of us. This Spirit becomes our fellowship and also enables us to have fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>Many times when we meet another child of God, although we may not say much outwardly, there is a mutual flow, a communication, between us. This flow, this communication, is of the Spirit. The Spirit in us is the Spirit of fellowship, just as the life of God in us is the life of fellowship.</p>
<p>We have the reality that there is a real, divine, spiritual, heavenly, and living current always flowing within us. As long as we are regenerated persons, we have this flow. We can prove this not merely by doctrine but by our up-to-date experience. When we are healthy in the spiritual life, the flow within us is pure, fresh, living, positive, and active.</p>
<p>We pray because there is a current flowing within us that urges us to pray. We do certain things for the Lord because the Lord urges us through the flow, the current, within us. The fellowship of life is constantly living and flowing within us. When we come together, if we all are in this flow, something living within us will simply echo one another. This is the fellowship of life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Apostles&rsquo; Fellowship Being<br />
with the Father and the Son</h2>
<p>First John 1 reveals a fellowship in two directions, vertical and horizontal. Horizontally we fellowship with one another, and vertically we fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. From life we have fellowship, and this fellowship is with the saints and with the Triune God. The vertical aspect of fellowship was initially established with the first apostles. The apostles then reported to the believers the eternal life in order that they might have fellowship with the apostles. Before the apostles reported the eternal life to them, the apostles themselves already had the vertical fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (v. 3). The initial experience of the apostles was vertical, but when the apostles reported the eternal life to others, they experienced the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>Verses 6 and 7 of 1 John 1 also indicate the vertical and horizontal aspects of the divine fellowship. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.&rdquo; This is the vertical aspect of fellowship. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.&rdquo; This is the horizontal aspect of fellowship. Both aspects of the divine fellowship are closely related; it is difficult to say which aspect comes first. If you do not have the proper fellowship with the Lord, it is difficult to have fellowship with your fellow believers. In the same way, if you do not have the proper fellowship with your fellow believers, it is difficult to have fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>In verse 3 only the Father and the Son are mentioned, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship. Actually, the fellowship of the eternal life is the imparting of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;into the believers as their unique portion to enjoy today and for eternity.</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were brought into this fellowship. When we called on the name of the Lord, we may say that the Spirit came into us, that God came into us, or that the divine life came into us. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit into us, for the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the Triune God is the divine life. The One who is now in us is the divine life, the Triune God, who is the Spirit and Jesus Christ. The divine, eternal life is a person, Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Believers&rsquo; Having Fellowship with the Apostles</h2>
<p>The fellowship of the divine life is a fellowship between the believers and the apostles (1 John 1:3b; Acts 2:42). This means that there is a joint enjoyment of the Triune God among the believers and the apostles. The believers and the apostles need to have contact with one another. When there is the proper contact, there will be a two-way traffic, and this traffic is fellowship, a common participation. When we have this two-way traffic, we enjoy the divine life that is within us. This means that when we have fellowship, we have the enjoyment of the divine life. The more two-way traffic we have, the better it will be. The more we contact the apostles, the more we will enjoy the divine life. Whenever we come to the apostles&rsquo; writings, we may have the sense of being brought into fellowship with the apostles and enjoying the two-way traffic between us and them. Then in this traffic we enjoy the divine life together with them. John says that first the believers have fellowship with the apostles through the divine life. Then he says that the apostles have fellowship with the Father and the Son. By this we see that fellowship joins the believers to the apostles and to the Father and the Son. Therefore, in this fellowship there is the full oneness of the divine life.</p>
<p>The fellowship in the Body is the fellowship of the apostles. Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo; We cannot have any fellowship other than the apostles&rsquo; fellowship. Among the saints there is only one fellowship because there is only one life, one source of life, and one Lord of life&mdash;Christ Himself. The Lord Christ is the unique source of this unique life; hence, in this unique life we have the unique fellowship. In the universe all the believers throughout time and space have only one fellowship, the fellowship that comes from the unique life, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The divine fellowship is between us and the Father and also between us and all the members of the Body. Just as in our body there are many members but one circulation of blood, so also in the Body of Christ we are the many members of His Body with one fellowship in Christ as our life. The life-giving Spirit is flowing within all the members of the great, universal Body of Christ. Within His universal Body there is one flow, the flow of the divine life, the current of the water of life. The water is the divine life, and the divine life is the Triune God. The more we remain in Christ, the more we have this fellowship.</p>
<p>Our Christian life is a life of the fellowship of the divine life. The New Testament reveals that the Christian meeting, the Christian married life, and the Christian work are just the divine fellowship. The divine fellowship is everything in the Christian life.</p>
<p>In 1 John 1:2-3 the apostles wanted to have fellowship with the believers; this is horizontal fellowship. Then the apostles stated that their fellowship was with the Triune God; this is vertical fellowship. The vertical fellowship brings us into the horizontal fellowship. The horizontal fellowship then brings us into the vertical fellowship on a larger scale. This larger scale of fellowship is the meetings. In the proper church meetings, everyone should be full of the enjoyment of Christ, participating in the vertical and horizontal aspects of the divine fellowship. All the functioning in the meetings should be an expression of the divine fellowship. To prophesy is an expression of this fellowship. To testify is also a part of this fellowship. To read a verse from the Bible to the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting may also be a small part of this fellowship. The entire meeting should be a fellowship.</p>
<p>Eventually, in this divine fellowship God is interwoven with us. This interweaving is the mingling of God with man. All the meetings should be an interwoven fellowship with both the vertical and horizontal aspects. Our married life should also be an interwoven fellowship. The husband and the wife should not only be interwoven with each other but also with the Lord. The real Christian marriage should be the divine fellowship. In addition, our coordination and work together should be the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>We must realize that when fellowship disappears, God also disappears. God comes as the fellowship. Today our meetings, our married life, the coordination among the co-workers, and the fellowship among the local churches are abnormal because we are short of this fellowship. The divine fellowship is everything in the Christian life. When we live in the divine fellowship, our Christian life becomes very living, active, and full of impact. We need to fully enter into the experience of the divine fellowship in its two aspects by the two spirits.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the fellowship of the divine life in the Body of Christ corresponds to the circulation of the blood in the physical body. It is this circulation which unites all the members with the head and with each other. The body and the head are one because of this circulation. All the members in the body are kept in &ldquo;fellowship,&rdquo; or oneness, with each other by this same circulation. Circulation is not something other than the blood itself. When the blood flows in the blood vessels, there is circulation; when the blood is stationary, there is no circulation. Once the blood flow stops, death and detachment result, and the members are no longer related to each other or to the head. Likewise, the fellowship of the divine life is the flow of life through all the members of the Body of Christ. &ldquo;Fellowship&rdquo; is not our greeting each other and engaging in conversation. The church is not a social club or a charitable organization; it is the Body of Christ. In this Body flows the divine, eternal life, which is the living person of God Himself. Apart from this flowing, there is death and detachment.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, fellowship is the flow of life, the flow of the Holy Spirit, within the children of God. Again this flow, this fellowship, is illustrated by the circulation of the blood in our physical body. The Word says that the life of the flesh is in the blood (Lev. 17:11). This means that the circulation of blood is the flow of blood, the &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; of the body. We cannot say that the blood in our body is the blood of our hand or the blood of our feet. If the blood in a person&rsquo;s hand stops moving and remains in that particular place, then the hand becomes dead. When the blood flow has a problem, the body is in an abnormal situation. Likewise, the fellowship of the Body is the circulation of the life of Christ in us, which is also the circulation of the Spirit of life in us. The circulation of the Spirit of life has at least two functions: it brings in the spiritual supply that we need, and it discharges all the improper, useless, and dead things from within us (Titus 3:5). Whenever there is a lack of fellowship among God&rsquo;s children, there is a lack of spiritual supply among them. Furthermore, there is the accumulation of many improper things within them, which creates problems. As a consequence, the Body of Christ becomes ill. We need to see that in order for the life of Christ to be continually living and strong, we, as the children of God, need to have continual fellowship among us. Whenever this fellowship is stopped, the supply of life is stopped, and death is brought in. Thus, the Body of Christ suffers loss related to spiritual death.</p>
<p>If we do not see the believers and do not attend any meetings for a long time, although we may pray and meditate, our spirit seems to become sick, lacking vitality. This is because although we may fellowship with the Lord and have no problem with Him, we are cut off from the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Yet as soon as we resume our fellowship with the believers, we are refreshed, revived, supplied, happy, pleasant, and bright. This is the fellowship of the Body, and grace is brought into us through fellowship.</p>
<p>In the church meetings, such as the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting, there is a fellowship in the depth of our spirit. The prayers and praises of the saints flow into us. We may feel somewhat despondent before a meeting, but during the meeting we spontaneously sense a flow in our inner being. Once there is a flow, we are altogether enlivened and refreshed in our spirit. We may not listen to many messages, yet we are enlivened simply by praising and praying together with all the saints. This is fellowship and the function of fellowship.</p>
<p>Fellowship indicates a putting away of private interests and a joining with others for a certain common purpose. Hence, to have fellowship with the apostles, to be in the fellowship of the apostles, and to have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles&rsquo; fellowship is to put aside our private interests and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose. This purpose, according to John&rsquo;s subsequent writings, is twofold: (1) that the believers grow in the divine life by abiding in the Triune God (1 John 2:12-27) and, based on the divine birth, live a life of the divine righteousness and the divine love (2:28&mdash;5:3) to overcome the world, death, sin, the devil, and idols (5:4-21); and (2) that the local churches be built up as the lampstands for the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1&mdash;3) and consummate in the New Jerusalem as the full expression of God for eternity (Rev. 21&mdash;22). Our participation in the apostles&rsquo; enjoyment of the Triune God is our joining with them and with the Triune God for His divine purpose, which is common to God, the apostles, and all the believers. In this fellowship we enjoy God, the apostles, the believers, the universal church, and even the local churches. All this enjoyment depends on the fellowship of the divine life, and this fellowship issues out of the divine life itself.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">d. This Fellowship Bringing the Believers<br />
into God as Light</h2>
<p>First John 1:5-7a says, &ldquo;This is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.&rdquo; The fellowship of the divine life brings the believers into God as light, which is the source of the truth. The message that John and the other early disciples heard was, undoubtedly, the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in John 8:12 and 9:5&mdash;that He is the light. However, John said here that the message was that God is light. This indicates that the Lord Jesus is God, implying the essence of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Expressions such as <em>God is light, God is love</em> (1 John 4:8, 16), and <em>God is Spirit</em> (John 4:24) are used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense. They denote and describe the nature of God. In His nature, God is Spirit, love, and light. Spirit denotes the nature of God&rsquo;s person; love, the nature of God&rsquo;s essence; and light, the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which is of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit and Spirit is life. Within this life are love and light. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth. John&rsquo;s Gospel reveals that the Lord Jesus brought grace and truth to us (1:14, 17) that we might have the divine life (3:14-16), whereas John&rsquo;s Epistle unveils that the fellowship of the divine life brings us to the very source of grace and truth, which are the divine love and the divine light. John&rsquo;s Epistle is the continuation of his Gospel. In John&rsquo;s Gospel it is God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children (1:12-13); in John&rsquo;s Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father&rsquo;s life, going to the Father to participate in His love and light. The former was God&rsquo;s coming out to the outer court to meet our need at the altar (Lev. 4:28-31); the latter is our entering into the Holy of Holies to contact Him at the Ark (Exo. 25:22). This is further and deeper in the experience of the divine life. After receiving the divine life by believing into the Son in John&rsquo;s Gospel, we should go on to enjoy this life through the fellowship of this life in John&rsquo;s Epistle. The entire Epistle discloses to us this one thing, that is, the enjoyment of the divine life through our abiding in its fellowship.</p>
<p>In 1 John 1:7 we are told to walk in the light. The Greek word translated &ldquo;walk&rdquo; means to move, act, and have our being. As we remain in God, we should dwell in Him and have our being in Him. God is our true dwelling place, our home. Hence, wherever God goes, we should go with Him and in Him.</p>
<p>We need to know not only who God is but also what God is. First John 1:5 tells us that God is light and that in Him is no darkness at all. The God in whom we dwell is light. The primary aspect of the condition of maintaining our fellowship with God is to dwell in God as light. When the house in which we dwell is full of light, we also are in light, not in darkness. In a similar way, when we dwell in God, we dwell in light, for God is light. Light is God&rsquo;s expression; it is God shining. Hence, when we dwell in God, who is the shining One, we are in light.</p>
<p>If we do not dwell in God, our fellowship with Him will immediately be broken. Whenever we do not dwell in God, we are out of the divine fellowship. However, our life relationship with God is not broken. For example, whether a child&rsquo;s behavior is good or bad, he still has a relationship in life with his father. Whether a child stays at home or tries to run away, the relationship in life with his father remains unbroken. However, the child may not remain in fellowship with his father. There may be times when he does not want to be in the same room with his father or talk with him face to face. This is because the fellowship has been broken, although the life relationship remains. Likewise, our life relationship with God cannot be broken, but our fellowship with Him will be broken if we do not abide in Him as the divine light.</p>
<p>In verse 5 John says that in God there is no darkness at all. As light is the nature of God in His expression, so darkness is the nature of Satan in his evil works (3:8). Thank God that He has delivered us out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 2:9). The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us. This light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it (John 1:4-5). When we follow this light, we will by no means walk in darkness (8:12), which, according to the context, is the darkness of sin (1 John 1:7-10).</p>
<p>Lying is of Satan, who is the father of liars (John 8:44). The satanic darkness is versus the divine light, and the satanic lie is versus the divine truth. As the divine truth is the expression of the divine light, so the satanic lie is the expression of the satanic darkness. If we say that we have fellowship with God, who is light, and walk in the darkness, we lie in the expression of the satanic darkness and do not practice the truth in the expression of the divine light.</p>
<p>First John 1:6 says, &ldquo;If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.&rdquo; To have fellowship with God is to have an intimate and living contact with Him in the flow of the divine life according to the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing in our spirit (2:27). This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine light and divine love.</p>
<p>In verse 6 of chapter 1 <em>truth</em> denotes the revealed reality of God in its aspect of the divine light. It is the issue and realization of the divine light mentioned in verse 5. The divine light is the source in God; truth is the issue and realization of the divine light in us (cf. John 3:19-21). When we abide in the divine light, which we enjoy in the fellowship of the divine life, we practice the truth&mdash;what we have realized in the divine light. When we abide in the source, its issue becomes our practice.</p>
<p>We walk in the light, but God is in the light because He is light. Henry Alford says, &ldquo;The light is the element in which God dwells: compare 1 Tim. 6:16....this walking in the light, as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God, but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God&rsquo;s eternal being: not imitation, but coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life.&rdquo; When we walk and live in the light of God, we have the joint enjoyment of the Triune God and the joint participation in His divine purpose. The fellowship of the divine life brings us the divine light, and the divine light keeps us in the fellowship, that is, in the joint enjoyment of God and the joint participation in His purpose.</p>
<p>To walk in the divine light is not merely to dwell in this light; it is to live, move, act, do things, and have our being in the divine light, the light which is actually God Himself. When we dwell, live, and have our being in God, we walk in the divine light, which is the expression of God.</p>
<p>When the divine light shines, we see all the different truths, and these truths are realities. But when we do not have the divine light but are rather in darkness, we have the sense that everything is vanity and emptiness. When you are in the divine light, you can see the truth, the reality. For example, when you are in the light, God is a reality to you, and the divine life is also a reality. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s holiness, love, and grace are all realities to you. When we walk in the light, we see one reality after another. However, when we are in darkness, nothing is real to us. On the contrary, everything is empty and vain. When we are in darkness, we do not have any reality, because we do not see anything. Instead of the sense of reality, we have the sense of emptiness and vanity.</p>
<p>When we dwell in God, we are in the fellowship. When we are in this fellowship, we are in light. Then as we walk in the light, Christ, the Spirit, the church, the Body, and the members of the Body are all real to us. We see Christ, the Spirit, the church, the Body, and the ground of the church, and they are all real to us.</p>
<p>It is when we are in the light that we see the truth. If we are in the light, whatever we do will be real. Not only will we practice what is right and proper; we will do what is real. This means that whatever we do is a reality. Habitually and automatically, we will practice the truth, the reality. If we do this, we will keep ourselves in the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>As believers, we all have some apprehension of the truth, but only a small number of believers may be in the light. Light is in God and is God Himself. Until we are brought into God Himself, we may be under the shining of the light but not in the light. To be under the shining of the light is one thing; to be in the light is another. Although under the shining we may have the truth, or the realization, we are not in the light until we are in God Himself. Then every hidden thing will be exposed. From the time that we were saved, we have been under the shining, coming to certain realizations and understandings. But some day we will be willing for this inner fellowship to bring us into God. In Him we will not merely be under the shining but also in the light. Today many Christians are in darkness, but some are under the shining. Very few, however, are in the light. Probably a good number of us have occasionally had experiences in which we were brought into God and recognized that we were in the light.</p>
<p>Suppose you become annoyed with another brother. You are not yet in the light, but under the shining you sense that your attitude was poor. You go to that brother and apologize that your attitude earlier was wrong. Some Christians who are fully in darkness would not even admit that they were wrong to be annoyed with a brother. When you allow the inner fellowship to bring you into God, however, you will be in the light. Under its glare you will tremble, realizing not only that your attitude toward your brother should be condemned but also that you yourself in every part are sinful, fully contaminated, and thoroughly unclean. In the light there is no excuse or escape. You may weep, repent, and take hours to confess.</p>
<p>In this fellowship with the Father we have light, and in this light we have fellowship (1 John 1:3, 5, 7). The result of being in the light is the recognition that we are utterly sinful, that every member of our body is sinful, and that every relationship with others is sinful. Because we are in the old creation, nothing about us is clean; we are polluted and condemned. Everything within us&mdash;our feelings, our intentions, our decisions, our concepts, our ideas&mdash;is sinful. As human beings we are full of sin. The reason we do not have this conviction is that we are not in the light. When Isaiah was brought into the glory of God, he said, &ldquo;Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell&rdquo; (Isa. 6:5). We have some amount of truth, knowing that we should do this and be like that, but such a realization is not light; it is only truth. If we are willing to abide in the fellowship, it will bring us into God. Then we will be thoroughly exposed by this light from which nothing can be hidden.</p><h2 class="head4">e. The Blood of Jesus God&rsquo;s Son<br />
Cleansing the Believers from All Sin</h2>
<p>First John 1:7b says, &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&rdquo; When we live in the divine light, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God&rsquo;s divine nature and through God&rsquo;s nature in us, all our sins, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness. At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained. Our relationship with God is unbreakable, yet our fellowship with Him can be interrupted. The former is of life, whereas the latter is based on our living, though it also is of life. One is unconditional; the other is conditional. Our fellowship, which is conditional, needs to be maintained by the constant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>Light takes away all our cover-ups; it penetrates every hiding place. It so exposes us that we cry out, &ldquo;Woe is me! I am unclean!&rdquo; At that moment the blood cleanses. Verse 7 clearly tells us that if we are in the light, the blood follows the light to cleanse us. There is no requirement on our part to apply the blood. To apply the blood means that we have the realization that we are sinful but have not yet had our sins exposed in the light. Whatever the light exposes, the blood cleanses. We should praise the Lord for His provision.</p>
<p>The blood of Jesus, God&rsquo;s Son, cleanses us from every sin. The name Jesus denotes the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title <em>His Son</em> denotes the Lord&rsquo;s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, <em>the blood of Jesus His Son</em> indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man shed for the redeeming of God&rsquo;s fallen creatures, with the divine surety as its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time.</p>
<p>No other verse in the New Testament uses the expression <em>Jesus His Son.</em> Jesus was a true man, a genuine human being, and the blood of Jesus was the blood of a real man. Because we are human beings, we need to be redeemed by human blood. In the Old Testament the blood for atonement was of animals, and was a type of the blood of Christ. However, animal blood could not actually redeem us, because we are human beings, not animals. As human beings, we need the efficacious blood of Jesus, the blood of a genuine man.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s divinity indicated by the words <em>His Son</em> is a guarantee, a surety, that the efficacy of the blood of Jesus will remain forever. The Lord&rsquo;s humanity qualifies Him to have the blood to shed for our redemption, and His divinity insures the efficacy of the power of this redeeming blood. The efficacy of the cleansing blood of Jesus is insured forever by His divinity.</p>
<p>The tense of this verb <em>cleanses</em> in Greek is present and denotes continuous action, indicating that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. Cleansing here refers to the instant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood in our conscience. Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (Heb. 9:12, 14), and the efficacy of that cleansing lasts forever before God, so that that cleansing need not be repeated. However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Lord&rsquo;s blood washes our sin and sins in the presence of God. According to the typology in the Old Testament, the blood of the sacrifice was brought into the tabernacle and sprinkled in the Holy of Holies in the presence of God. This signifies the once-for-all washing of our sin and sins in the presence of God. On the other hand, the Lord&rsquo;s blood washes our sin and sins in our conscience. This instant cleansing is typified by the purification with the water of impurity mixed with the ashes of the heifer (Num. 19:2-10). The cleansing in 1 John 1:7 is not the eternal cleansing before God; rather, it is the continuous cleansing in our conscience. As we abide in the light, we are cleansed continually by the blood of Jesus.</p>
<p>The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word <em>sin</em> (singular) and the word <em>sins</em> (plural). <em>Sin</em> refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan (Rom. 5:12). It is dealt with in the second section of Romans, 5:12&mdash;8:13 (with the exception of 7:5, where <em>sins</em> is mentioned). <em>Sins</em> refers to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, 1:18&mdash;5:11. However, in 1 John 1:7 <em>sin</em> in the singular, used with the adjective <em>every,</em> does not denote the indwelling sin but every single sin we commit (v. 10) after we are regenerated; each such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature (Rom. 7:17), has been dealt with by Christ as our sin offering (Lev. 4; Isa. 53:10; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:26). Our sins, our trespasses, have been dealt with by Christ as our trespass offering (Lev. 5; Isa. 53:11; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28). However, after our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering for the sin in our nature as indicated in 1 John 1:8, and as our trespass offering for the sins in our conduct as indicated in verse 9.</p>
<p>In 1 John 1 there is a cycle in our spiritual life, a cycle formed of four crucial things&mdash;the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in its fellowship, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus the Son of God that we may have more eternal life. The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach the maturity of life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">114. An Advocate</h2>
<p>In 1 John 2:1-2 Christ is presented as an Advocate. &ldquo;My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; is a translation of the Greek word <em>parakletos,</em> which is translated &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; in John&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. An Advocate with the Father,<br />
Jesus Christ the Righteous</h2>
<p>The Lord is &ldquo;an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous&rdquo; (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) An Advocate</h2>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; refers to one who is called to another&rsquo;s side to aid him; hence, a helper. It refers also to one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else; hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word carries the sense of consoling and consolation; hence, a consoler, a comforter. It is used in the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case or our affairs. It is used in 1 John 2 in reference to the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father. When we sin, He, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding (Rom. 8:34) and pleading for us.</p>
<p>As we have seen, &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; is a translation of the Greek word <em>parakletos.</em> This word is formed of two words: the preposition <em>para</em> (used here as a prefix) and the word <em>kletos.</em> Put together, these words denote someone called to our side. The Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is used in the New Testament only by John. In his Gospel John says, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever&rdquo; (14:16). This indicates that while the Lord was with the disciples, one <em>parakletos,</em> one Comforter, was there with them. But this <em>parakletos</em> was about to leave. Thus, there was the need for another <em>parakletos,</em> another Comforter, to come. Actually, the first <em>parakletos</em> and the other <em>parakletos</em> are one. The One who is called &ldquo;another Comforter&rdquo; is now in us as the life-giving Spirit, and the One who was the first Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ, is now in the heavens at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter. However, these two are one. For this reason, the Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit. If we put 1 John 2:1 together with John 14:16, we see that today the Lord Jesus is our Advocate at the right hand of God in the heavens; at the same time, He is also the Comforter in our spirit. In the heavens He is the Advocate with the Father; in our spirit He is the Comforter. This is why He is the ladder upon whom the angels of God are ascending and descending (1:51). As the ascended Lord, He is our Paraclete with the Father, taking care of our case in the heavens. As the indwelling Spirit, He is the &ldquo;Paraclete with us&rdquo; (14:16-17), the One alongside of us who is taking care of us.</p>
<p>The Greek word <em>parakletos</em> is rendered &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; in John 14:16 and &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; in 1 John 2:1. Also, in John 14:26 and 15:26 this Greek word is translated &ldquo;Comforter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo; is an appropriate translation of <em>parakletos</em> in John 14:16, for in this verse there is a certain feeling that this Paraclete comes to comfort the disciples in their sorrow caused by the Lord&rsquo;s leaving them. The Lord had told His disciples that He was leaving, and they were troubled by this. Therefore, in this chapter the Lord indicated to the disciples that they did not need to be sorrowful, for He would ask the Father to send them another Paraclete, another Comforter. Because the troubled disciples were in need of comfort, it is correct to render <em>parakletos</em> in John 14:26 as &ldquo;Comforter.&rdquo; This Greek word implies the thought of comfort and refers to one who helps us, serves us, stands by us, and goes along with us. Such a one surely is a comforter.</p>
<p>It is also correct to translate <em>parakletos</em> in 1 John 2:1 as &ldquo;Advocate.&rdquo; According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate. The situation in 1 John 2:1, in contrast to that in John 14:16, is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney.</p>
<p>The Advocate in 2:1 is actually a spiritual attorney. This <em>parakletos</em> stands beside us, like a nurse caring for us, and serves us. The <em>parakletos</em> is also a counselor. At school the students have a counselor to help them choose the right courses. Our <em>parakletos</em> also helps us in making choices. In his translation of 1 John 2:1 J. N. Darby uses the word &ldquo;patron.&rdquo; In his note he explains that the word <em>patron</em> is used in the sense of a Roman patron, who maintained the interests of his clients in every way. One function of a Roman patron was much like that of an attorney today. When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney. The attorney then takes care of our case. This is the function of our Advocate in verse 1. <em>Parakletos</em> is an all-inclusive word. It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling. It includes the concept of an advocate, an attorney, who takes care of our case.</p>
<p>Christ, an Advocate with the Father, takes our case as our attorney. Satan, the enemy of God and our subtle enemy, accuses us before our God day and night (Rev. 12:10). Perhaps he tells God that although God is holy and righteous, His children whom He loves are unrighteous and filthy. The Father then may tell him that His children have an excellent attorney, Jesus Christ. Our attorney, Christ, also may tell Satan to look upon His blood, which cleanses us from every sin, and to shut his accusing mouth.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 12:10 and 11, Satan accuses God&rsquo;s children day and night, but they can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb. Once we realize that we are unclean, unholy, and unrighteous, we may feel defeated and be cut off from the Lord&rsquo;s dispensing of His life into us. Yet we have not only the blood of Jesus but also Him as our Advocate, our Attorney. We should tell Satan to shut his mouth and should praise the Lamb of God for His overcoming blood. Then the divine life will be dispensed into us once again. Christ, our Advocate, takes care of our case so that life-dispensing can continue.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) With the Father</h2>
<p>In 1 John 2:1 Christ is an Advocate with the Father. The phrase <em>with the Father</em> is used also in 1:2. In each case the Greek word translated &ldquo;with&rdquo; is <em>pros,</em> with the accusative, a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with. The Lord Jesus as our Advocate is living in communion with the Father.</p>
<p>In 1 John 2:1 the divine title <em>the Father</em> indicates that our case, which the Lord Jesus as our Advocate undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between children and the Father. Through regeneration we have been born children of God. After regeneration, if we sin, it is a matter of children sinning against their Father. Our Advocate, who is the sacrifice for our propitiation, undertakes for us to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>John speaks of the blood of Jesus in chapter 1 and of our Advocate in chapter 2. Not only has God provided the blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for us so that we may be forgiven and cleansed, but God has also prepared Christ as our Advocate. First, the Lord Jesus shed His blood as the price of our redemption. Then after shedding His blood, He becomes our Advocate, our heavenly attorney, taking care of our case. How marvelous that our Advocate pays our debt and takes care of our case!</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is our Advocate with the Father, and not simply with God, indicates that our case, which the Lord undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between the Father and us as the Father&rsquo;s children. Whenever we sin, we offend our Father. Our judge, therefore, is a Father-judge, our court is our spiritual home, and our case is a family matter. But we do have a member of our family, our elder Brother, the Son of the Father, who is our Advocate with the Father. As our Advocate, our elder Brother takes our case. Christ in the heavens today is also our Advocate before the righteous God. If we sin after we are saved, based upon His being our propitiation, He pleads for us in order to recover the broken fellowship between God and us. This is the reason John says that we have an Advocate with the Father.</p>
<p>The truth in the Bible is always presented in a balanced way. The truth in 1 John 2:1 is also balanced. On the one hand, the title <em>Father</em> is a sign of love; on the other hand, the title <em>Advocate</em> is a sign of righteousness. For example, a father loves his child. But if the child misbehaves, the father will have a case against him, a case based on righteousness. Although the child is still loved by his father and will continue to be taken care of by him, the father has a case against the child and may need to discipline him. In a similar way, whenever we sin, the Father has a case against us. Therefore, we need a heavenly attorney. We need Jesus Christ, our elder Brother, to be our Advocate.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Jesus Christ, the Righteous</h2>
<p>Our Lord Jesus is the only righteous man among all men. His righteous act (Rom. 5:18) on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners. Only He is qualified to be our Advocate, to care for us in our sinning condition and restore us to a righteous condition that the relationship between us and our Father, who is righteous, may be appeased. Jesus Christ, the Righteous, is the righteous One, who is our Advocate, our Attorney with the Father, our heavenly Judge.</p>
<p>Instead of saying &ldquo;Jesus Christ the Righteous,&rdquo; we may say &ldquo;Jesus Christ, the right One.&rdquo; Jesus Christ certainly is the One who is right, the right One, and only this right One can be our Advocate with the Father. The reason we have a problem and the Father has a case against us is that we are the wrong ones. Because we are the ones who are wrong, we need the righteous One to take care of our case, the One who is right with the Father and with us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. A Propitiation for Our Sins, and<br />
Not for Our Sins Only, but Also for the Whole World</h2>
<p>Christ is &ldquo;the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world&rdquo; (1 John 2:2). Here the propitiation refers to the sacrifice for propitiation. The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for the satisfying of God&rsquo;s demand, thus appeasing the relationship between God and us. Hence, He is the sacrifice for our propitiation before God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is a sacrifice for propitiation, not only for our sins but also for the whole world. However, this propitiation is conditioned on man&rsquo;s receiving the Lord by believing in Him. The unbelievers do not experience its efficacy, not because it has any fault but because they do not believe.</p>
<p>The Greek word for &ldquo;propitiation&rdquo; in 1 John 2:2 and in 4:10 is <em>hilasmos.</em> In 1:7 we have the blood of Jesus; in 2:1 the person of Christ as our Advocate; and now, in verse 2 we have Christ as a propitiation for our sins. Our Advocate, who shed His blood for the cleansing of our sins, is our propitiation. This word <em>propitiation</em> indicates appeasing, or peacemaking. When a child is wrong and his father has a case against him, there is no peace between them. In such a situation, there is the need of peacemaking and of appeasing the father. This peacemaking, this appeasing, is propitiation.</p>
<p>Whenever God&rsquo;s children offend the Father, the fellowship between them is broken. Instead of peace, there is turmoil. Realizing the situation, the children should make confession to the Father, who is ready to forgive them and cleanse them. The cleansing blood has been provided, and the Father Himself is faithful to forgive and righteous to cleanse. But how can the peace between the Father and His children be restored? We may think that as long as there is forgiveness and cleansing, peace will come automatically. However, there is still the need for our Advocate to be our propitiation between the Father and us so that the Father may be appeased and the peace restored.</p>
<p>We need to be deeply impressed with all the divine provisions: the cleansing blood, the faithfulness of God, the righteousness of God, the Advocate, and the propitiation. With God we have the provisions of His faithfulness and righteousness, and with Christ we have the provisions of His blood and of Himself as our Advocate and propitiation. Day by day, we who have the divine life and the enjoyment of this life in fellowship need to be on the alert concerning sin. But if we sin, we should immediately make confession. Then we will experience the effectiveness of all these provisions. We will have the washing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood, the faithfulness and righteousness of the Father for our forgiveness and cleansing, and Christ as our Advocate and propitiation for the appeasing of the Father and the restoring of the peace between the Father and us. Through Christ as our Advocate and propitiation, we again have peace with the Father, and we enjoy fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>According to its biblical meaning, propitiation leads to enjoyment, for it ushers in fellowship between God and us. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 3:25, God has set forth Christ as a propitiation cover through faith in His blood. This indicates that Christ is not only the One who propitiates, but also that He is the place of propitiation. Christ as the propitiation place is the place where God and His redeemed people may converse, have fellowship, and enjoy one another.</p>
<p>Christ is the Advocate who pleads our case with the Father and who Himself is our propitiation, our Peacemaker. Christ Himself is actually the peace between God and us. This peace is the ground on which God and we may converse, have fellowship, and enjoy one another.</p>
<p>If we sin, we need to confess. If we confess our sins, the blood of Jesus will cleanse us from our sins. Then in His faithfulness and righteousness, the Father will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from unrighteousness. Furthermore, our Lord Jesus Christ will be the Advocate with the Father to handle our case. Eventually, after we confess our sins and are cleansed by the blood and forgiven by the Father, the Lord handles our case with the Father and then becomes the enjoyment that appeases the Father. In other words, this precious One becomes our propitiation and thus the base, the ground, where we enjoy God and have fellowship with Him and He with us.</p>
<p>As we consider this matter, we will realize that this is not merely a doctrine but is something very experiential. From experience we know that when we confess our sins, we have the sense that the blood has cleansed us and that the Father has forgiven us. Immediately, there is also a sense of enjoyment. That enjoyment is Christ as our propitiation. It is by this enjoyment, by Christ as our propitiation, that we may converse with God and He with us, and that together we may enjoy Christ and have fellowship around Christ. Therefore, Christ is the enjoyment that is the propitiation with God for us. Eventually, He becomes the ground of our fellowship with the Father. It is in this way that our fellowship, which is broken through sin, may be recovered. We should praise the Lord that by the five provisions&mdash;the blood, God&rsquo;s faithfulness and righteousness, the Advocate, and the propitiation&mdash;we are restored to full fellowship with God.</p>
<p>As the Lamb, Christ is the propitiation concerning our sins (1 John 2:2). A propitiation is a kind of appeasing. Because of our sins there was a turmoil, a problem between God and us. There was no peace. Christ as the Son of Man who was the Lamb of God died on the cross to be our propitiation. He calmed down the turmoil and solved the problem; hence, He is our propitiation. He calmed the turmoil, and He appeased God. So now there is a peaceful condition between God and us. This is for life dispensing. If there is not such a peaceful condition, there is no way for God to dispense His life into us. Life dispensing needs a peaceful situation. The Lord Jesus became the propitiation concerning our sins between God and us to create a peaceful situation for the life dispensing.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Attorney in the heavenly court, handling our case upon the basis of His own propitiatory work. When we come into the light, we are exposed that we are both sinful and unholy. Yet we should not be bothered by the exposing because immediately the blood of Jesus cleanses us. Because we lack the assurance that the blood has cleansed us, the apostle John goes on to remind us that Jesus Christ the Righteous is our Attorney and our propitiation. We should not be upset by the exposure of our evil condition, for it has already been taken care of by Him. As the propitiation for our sins, Christ has settled our problem with sin. Based upon His propitiatory work, He is now our heavenly Attorney who represents our case in the heavenly court.</p>
<p>We should notice that God &ldquo;is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo; (1:9). In this verse John does not say that God is merciful and kind. We are inclined to beg for mercy when we sin, but it is righteous for God to forgive us. Christ has made propitiation. God can therefore righteously forgive us, not because He is merciful or kind but because He is righteous. He has given us the good news; now He must keep His word. Otherwise, He would not be faithful. He righteously forgives us because of Christ&rsquo;s propitiation and faithfully forgives us because of His own spoken word.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">115. Our Abiding Place</h2>
<p>In 1 John 2:5-29; 3:5-8, 24; and 4:9-15, we see that we may enjoy Christ, who is a living person, as our abiding place.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God Sending His Son into the World<br />
as a Propitiation for Our Sins That We Might Live through Him, and as the Savior of the World That Whosoever Confesses That Jesus Is the Son of God,<br />
God Abiding in Him and He in God</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) A Propitiation for Our Sins</h2>
<p>First John 4:9 says, &ldquo;In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.&rdquo; In this verse we see God&rsquo;s intention and goal in sending the Son: God sent the Son so that we might live through Him. Living through the Son implies having the divine life. If we did not have life through Him, we could not live through Him. Therefore, living through the Son implies that we have received Him as our life. God sent His Son, and we have received Him as life. Now we live through Him.</p>
<p>God came to be a man so that we could have His divine life. If He had never been a man, He could not come into us and we could not have Him as our divine life. Incarnation was for the impartation of the divine life into us.</p>
<p>In verse 9 John says that God sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world. As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the &ldquo;world&rdquo; here refers to fallen mankind, whom God so loved that, by making them alive through His Son with His own life (John 3:16), they may become His children (1:12-13). We have seen that in 1 John 4:9 John tells us that God sent His Son into the world that we might live through Him.</p>
<p>We, the fallen people, are not only sinful in nature and conduct (Rom. 7:17-18; 1:28-32) but also dead in our spirit (Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13). God sent His Son into the world not only to be a propitiation for our sins that we might be forgiven (1 John 4:10) but also to be life to us that we might have life and live through Him. In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood (Eph. 1:7; Rev. 1:5) but also from our death by His life (1 John 3:14-15; John 5:24). He is not only the Lamb of God who takes away our sin (1:29); He is also the Son of God who gives us eternal life (3:36). He died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) that we might have eternal life in Him (John 3:14-16) and live through Him (6:57; 14:19). In this the love of God, which is God&rsquo;s essence, has been manifested.</p>
<p>In 1 John 4:10, John goes on to say, &ldquo;Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.&rdquo; The word <em>herein</em> refers to the following fact: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. In this fact is the higher and nobler love of God.</p>
<p>The word <em>propitiation</em> indicates that the Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Through His vicarious death and in Him as our Substitute, God is satisfied and appeased. Hence, He is the propitiation between God and us.</p>
<p>We had a problem in our relationship with God. Therefore, God sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins in order to restore our relationship with Him. God did this because of His love. Although sin caused a problem in our relationship with God, we had no thought of dealing with our sin in order to restore our relationship with God. Even if we desired to restore this relationship, we would have had no ability or way. However, God&rsquo;s love caused Him to send His Son to accomplish this matter for us before we even had such a thought.</p>
<p>Since our sins brought us under the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness, God could not receive us or abide with us peaceably. Therefore, God&rsquo;s love caused Him to send His Son as a propitiation for our sins so that He could receive us and abide with us peaceably according to the requirements of His righteousness and holiness. God&rsquo;s love fulfilled all the demands of God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness.</p>
<p>In 1 John 4:9 we see that God sent His Son in order that we might live through Him. In verse 10 we see that God sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. If we consider these verses together, we will see that God&rsquo;s sending His Son as a propitiation for our sins is not the goal. Rather, this is a procedure for arriving at the goal, and the goal is that we may have life and live through the Son. Therefore, God sent His Son as a propitiation for us with the intention that through His Son we may have life and live.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Savior of the World</h2>
<p>First John 4:14-15 goes on to say, &ldquo;We have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.&rdquo; As in verse 9 and John 3:16, <em>world</em> here denotes fallen mankind. The Father&rsquo;s sending of the Son to be our Savior is an external act, so that through our confessing of the Son He can abide in us and we in Him (1 John 4:15). The apostles have beheld and testify this. This is the outward testimony. In addition to this, God&rsquo;s internal act toward us is the sending of His Spirit to dwell in us as inward evidence that we abide in Him and He in us (v. 13).</p>
<p>In 1 John 4:9, 10, and 14 the apostle John says three times that God has sent His Son. God sent the Son that we might live through Him, He sent the Son as a propitiation concerning our sins, and He sent the Son as the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>God the Father sent His Son as the Savior of the world (v. 14) that men may believe in Him by confessing that Jesus is the Son of God, so that God may abide in them and they in God. But the heretical Cerinthians did not confess this; hence, they did not have God abiding in them, nor did they abide in God. Whoever confesses this, God abides in him and he in God. He becomes one with God in the divine life and nature.</p>
<p>We may have expected John to say that whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has the forgiveness of sins or has eternal life. However, here John says that whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God. We should use this verse in preaching the gospel. We should tell people that if they believe in the Lord and confess that Jesus is the Son of God, they will be forgiven of their sins and will be saved. We should also tell them that if they confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God will come into them and abide in them, and they will be able to abide in God. This is the highest preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>This matter of dwelling in God and God dwelling in us is repeated several times in 1 John. Again and again, the New Testament points out that God dwells in us. We are even called God&rsquo;s temple (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19) and His dwelling place, His house (Eph. 2:22; 1 Tim. 3:15). God houses Himself in us. Ephesians 3:17 indicates that Christ is making His home in our hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Our Sins Having Been Forgiven<br />
because of His Name</h2>
<p>First John 2:12 says, &ldquo;I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name.&rdquo; The forgiveness of sins is the basic element of God&rsquo;s gospel (Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; 10:43; 13:38). Through this, the believers who receive Christ are regenerated and become the children of God (John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>John realized that forgiveness of sins is a basic factor in our becoming God&rsquo;s children. In 1 John 2:12 John tells the little children that their sins have been forgiven because of the Lord&rsquo;s name. They have believed in this precious name and have received the forgiveness of sins. The forgiveness of sins is the first basic element in the gospel. If we believe in the name of the Lord and call on His name, the first blessing that we receive is the forgiveness of sins. Through forgiveness, we have been justified and have become the children of God. Regeneration, therefore, is based on the forgiveness of sins. This is the reason that the apostle John regards forgiveness of sins as the basic factor in addressing the recipients of this Epistle as little children.</p>
<p>According to verse 12, our sins <em>have been</em> forgiven because of His name. This verse does not say that our sins <em>will be</em> forgiven but that they <em>have been</em> forgiven because of His name, not because of our works or anything of ourselves. If forgiveness was dependent on our works or anything of ourselves, we would need to wait until we worked it out before the matter could be decided. But this is not the case. Instead, forgiveness is because of His name. Once we believe in and confess the Lord&rsquo;s name, we participate in His name and become related to His name; therefore, because of His name our sins <em>have been</em> forgiven. When we confess the Lord&rsquo;s name and possess His name, our sins are forgiven at that time because of His name. Thus, God <em>has</em> forgiven all our sins. We do not need to wait for them to be forgiven in the future. At the time that we believed, He forgave us. Moreover, He <em>has</em> forgiven all our sins and all our evil, not just a certain portion of our sins. Thus, once we believe, all our sins <em>are</em> forgiven, and we <em>are</em> saved.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. As We Confess the Son,<br />
Our Having the Father Also</h2>
<p>In 1 John 2:23 we are told that &ldquo;everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.&rdquo; Since the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; Isa. 9:6), to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. Here to deny the Son is to deny the deity of Christ, to deny that the man Jesus is God. This is a great heresy.</p>
<p>In 1 John 2:23 John first says that anyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either. If the Son and the Father were not one, how could those who deny the Son not have the Father? In this verse John goes on to say that he who confesses the Son has the Father also. Whoever denies the Son has neither the Son nor the Father. But whoever confesses the Son has both the Son and the Father. Both the negative side and the positive side of this verse indicate that the Son and the Father are inseparable. Because the Father and the Son are one, we cannot separate the Son from the Father nor the Father from the Son.</p>
<p>We need to pay attention to the words <em>either</em> and <em>also</em> in verse 23. John says that whoever denies the Son does not have the Father <em>either.</em> Then he says that whoever confesses the Son has the Father <em>also.</em> These words indicate that the Father and the Son are one and inseparable. Therefore, to deny the Son is to deny both the Son and the Father, and to confess the Son is to confess both the Son and the Father.</p><h2 class="head4">d. As He Abides in Us, Our Abiding Both in Him and in the Father and Enjoying the Eternal Life</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) As He Abides in Us,<br />
Our Abiding Both in Him and in the Father</h2>
<p>First John 2:24-25 continues, &ldquo;As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise which He Himself promised us, the eternal life.&rdquo; The expression <em>that which you heard from the beginning</em> in verse 24 refers to the Word of life, that is, the Word of the eternal life that the believers heard from the beginning (1:1-2). Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (2:22), is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us. In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ&rsquo;s person (v. 26). This indicates that the Son and the Father are the eternal life for our regeneration and enjoyment. In this eternal life we have fellowship with God and with one another (1:2-3, 6-7) and have our being in our daily walk (2:6; 1:7).</p>
<p>Notice that here John speaks of our abiding in the Son and in the Father. In John 15:4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; This verse speaks of a mutual abiding: we abide in the Lord, and the Lord abides in us. But in 1 John 2:24 John refers to the Word of life abiding in us and says that if the Word of life abides in us, we abide in the Son and in the Father. By this we see that the Word of life is actually the Lord Himself. According to John 15:4, when we abide in the Lord, the Lord abides in us. Here it says that when the Word of life abides in us, we abide in the Son and in the Father. Once again, John puts the Father and the Son together as one, for the Father and the Son are one.</p>
<p>In Christ we have an abiding place which is an eternal person, and in this abiding place we may enjoy the eternal life. Christ, the eternal person, is our abiding place, and eternal life is our enjoyment.</p>
<p>In 1 John 2:25 John does not say, &ldquo;They promised us&rdquo;; he says, &ldquo;He Himself promised us.&rdquo; The singular pronoun <em>He</em> in verse 25, referring to both the Son and the Father in the preceding verse, indicates that the Son and the Father are one. As far as our experience of the divine life is concerned, the Son, the Father, Jesus, and Christ are all one. It is not that only the Son, and not the Father, is the eternal life to us. It is that Jesus, being the Christ as the Son and the Father, is the eternal, divine life to us for our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Our Enjoying the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>According to verse 24, if we take the Son as the way to reach the Father, eventually we reach both the Son and the Father. In this verse John speaks of abiding both in the Son and in the Father. It may sound logical to say that Christ as the Son is the only way for us to reach the Father as the destination. Therefore, if we do not take the way, we will not arrive at the destination; if we take the way, we will reach the destination. However, verse 24 suggests that if we take the way, we will have not only the destination but also the way. Here John indicates that we will abide not only in the destination but also in the way, that is, both in the Son and in the Father. This proves that both the Son and the Father are the destination. Not only is the Father the abiding place, but the Son is also. This means that the Son is both the way and the destination, both the way to enter into the dwelling place and the dwelling place itself.</p>
<p>Verse 25 says, &ldquo;This is the promise which He Himself promised us, the eternal life.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John eternal life is promised in such verses as 3:15; 4:14; and 10:10. In Titus 1:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages.&rdquo; This promise of eternal life must be the promise made by the Father to the Son in eternity. It must have been that in eternity past the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers.</p>
<p>According to the context of 1 John 2:22 through 25, the eternal life in verse 25 is Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son; all these are a composition of the eternal life. Hence, the eternal life also is an element of the all-inclusive compound indwelling Spirit, who moves within us.</p>
<p>The eternal life in verse 25 is the Word of life, and the Word of life is Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son. Here we have six matters: Jesus, Christ, the Father, the Son, the Word of life, and eternal life. From the Bible, especially from 1 John, we know that Jesus is the Christ, that Christ equals the Father and the Son, and that this One is also the Word of life and the eternal life.</p>
<p>Together Jesus, Christ, the Father, the Son, the Word of life, and eternal life are a divine compound. All these six are elements that have been compounded into a single ointment. In Jesus we have humanity, with the Father we have divinity, and with Christ we have the anointed One. With Jesus we have the incarnation and crucifixion, with Christ we have the resurrection, and with the Son we have life. Therefore, with these elements we have all the ingredients of the compound ointment: divinity, humanity, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and life.</p><h2 class="head4">e. As the Anointing Abides in Us<br />
and Teaches Us, Our Abiding in Him</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Anointing Abiding in Us and Teaching Us</h2>
<p>First John 2:27 says, &ldquo;As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&rdquo; The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit, who is fully typified by the anointing oil, the compound ointment, in Exodus 30:23-25. This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever (1 John 2:27); by Him the young children know the Father (v. 13) and know the truth (v. 21). As we abide in Christ, we enjoy the divine anointing, which is a wonderful person, the Spirit, moving and working in us. As this anointing abides in us and teaches us, we abide in Him.</p>
<p>The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit to apply all the ingredients of the processed Triune God and His activities into our inner being so that we may be fully mingled with Him for His corporate expression (vv. 20, 27; cf. Eph. 4:4-6). Moreover, the anointing, as the moving and working of the compound Spirit within us, anoints God into us so that we may be saturated with God, possess God, and understand the mind of God.</p>
<p>The Greek word for &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; is <em>Christos,</em> which means the &ldquo;anointed One,&rdquo; and the Greek word for &ldquo;anointing&rdquo; is <em>chrisma.</em> Both words are derived from the same root. Now we must go on to see that Christ as the anointed One becomes the anointing. Because He is the anointed One, He has an abundance of ointment with which to anoint us. Eventually, the anointed One becomes the anointing One. In fact, He even becomes the anointing.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God. Christ has been anointed with the divine ointment, and the ointment that is upon Him now flows to us. This is pictured in Psalm 133, which says that the anointing oil runs down, or flows, from the head of Aaron to his beard and even to the hem of his priestly garments. This indicates that Christ has an abundance of the anointing oil. God has poured the ointment upon Him. Through that anointing, Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One. When He entered into us as the anointed One, He became the anointing One in us. Actually, the anointing that dwells in us is the anointed One becoming the anointing One and also the anointing.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for the expression of Himself. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary for God in Christ to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. When He entered into resurrection, He became the compound, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is actually <em>Christos,</em> the anointed One, becoming the life-giving One. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him into us. The One we received is the anointed One, who through death and resurrection has become the anointing One. Furthermore, this anointing One is the all-inclusive indwelling Spirit. As soon as we believed in Him, He as the Spirit entered our spirit. Now He is within our spirit to anoint us with the element of the Triune God. The more we are anointed with the Triune God, the more the element of the Triune God is transfused into our being. Through this anointing, the fibers of our being will be saturated with all that the processed Triune God is. This is the anointing, which is the reality of the entire New Testament.</p>
<p>Concerning the indwelling of the Divine Trinity (John 14:17, 23), we do not need anyone to teach us. By the anointing of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, who is the composition of the Divine Trinity, we know and enjoy the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and life supply.</p>
<p>The teaching of the anointing is not an outward teaching by words but an inward teaching by the anointing through our inner spiritual consciousness. This teaching by the anointing adds the divine elements of the Trinity, which are the elements of the anointing compound Spirit, into our inner being. It is like the repeated painting of some article: not only does the paint indicate a definite color, but the addition of repeated coats adds the elements of the paint to the thing being painted. It is in this way that the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements.</p>
<p>This anointing is constantly moving and working within us. The purpose of this moving is to add the element of God into us. We understand God&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s leading not by an explicit word in letters but through the inward anointing. Today the inward moving and anointing of the Holy Spirit causes us to have more of the element of God. When God&rsquo;s element increases, we understand more of what God wants, and we are clearer about God&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>According to the context, the expression <em>all things</em> in 1 John 2:27 refers to all things concerning the person of Christ, which are related to the Divine Trinity. The teaching of the anointing concerning these things keeps us that we may abide in Him (the Divine Trinity), that is, in the Son and in the Father (v. 24).</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Our Abiding in Him</h2>
<p>John concludes verse 27 with an exhortation to abide in the Triune God. The Greek word translated &ldquo;abide&rdquo; is <em>meno,</em> a word that means &ldquo;to stay (in a given place, state, relation, or expectancy); hence, to abide, remain, and dwell.&rdquo; To abide in Him is to abide in the Son and in the Father. This is to remain and dwell in the Lord (John 15:4-5). It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light (1 John 1:2-3, 6-7), that is, to abide in the divine light (2:10). We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing so that our fellowship with God (1:3, 6) may be maintained.</p>
<p>The fellowship of the divine life depends on the anointing. This means that maintaining the fellowship of the divine life depends on abiding in the Lord and in the light. To abide in the Lord and in the light is equal to abiding in the Triune God.</p>
<p>The anointing has much to do with our abiding in the Lord. We enjoy the fellowship of the divine life so that we may abide in the Lord. This abiding is altogether a matter of the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Apart from the anointing, we cannot abide in the Lord. If we do not abide in the Lord, we cannot maintain the fellowship. Furthermore, if we do not maintain the fellowship, we cannot enjoy the riches of the divine life. We may also say that to enjoy the riches of the divine life, we need to maintain the fellowship; to maintain the fellowship, we need to abide in the Lord; and in order to abide in the Lord, we need to take care of the inner anointing, which is the moving of the indwelling Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>This abiding is the fellowship; to abide in the Lord is to fellowship with the Lord. We are kept in this fellowship, this abiding, by the anointing, which is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ointment within. This kind of anointing brings us into life. The more anointing we enjoy, the more life we have; the more life we have, the stronger the fellowship we are in; the stronger the fellowship we are in, the more light we have; and the more light we have, the more cleansing of the blood we need. Then more cleansing of the blood brings us into more anointing, and the more anointing we enjoy, the more we have life. This is a cycle. When we have life, we are in the fellowship; in the fellowship we are in the light; as we are in the light, we sense the need of the cleansing; under the cleansing we enjoy the anointing; and the anointing brings us more life.</p>
<p>If we quench the Spirit and neglect the words of the Lord, we will come out of the Lord. But if we neither quench the Spirit nor neglect the instant words of the Lord, we will abide in the Lord. When we abide in the Lord, spontaneously we can exercise our spirit, pray, and give thanks in everything. This is a practical way for us to abide in the Lord.</p>
<p>To abide in Christ is to dwell in Him, to remain in fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us (John 15:4-5; 1 John 2:27). To abide in Christ is to live in the Divine Trinity&mdash;taking Christ as our dwelling place (vv. 6, 24, 27-28; 3:6, 24; 4:13). To have Christ abiding in us is to have the Spirit of reality as the presence of the Triune God abiding in us (John 14:17). We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by caring for the inward teaching of the all-inclusive anointing (1 John 2:27). We abide in the divine fellowship with Christ by experiencing the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood and the application of the anointing Spirit to our inner being (John 15:4-5; 1 John 1:5, 7; 2:20, 27).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s abiding in us and our abiding in Him are altogether a matter of His being the life-giving Spirit in our spirit; by the bountiful, immeasurable Spirit in our spirit, we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; Phil. 1:19; John 3:34; 1 John 3:24; 4:13). The way to abide in Christ as the empowering One so that He may be activated within us as the inner operating God, the law of the Spirit of life, is by rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything (Phil. 4:13; 2:13; 1 Thes. 5:16-18; Col. 3:17). We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by dealing with the constant word in the Scriptures, which is outside of us, and the present word as the Spirit, which is within us (John 5:39-40; 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rev. 2:7). By the outward, written word we have the explanation, definition, and expression of the mysterious Lord, and by the inward, living word we have the experience of the abiding Christ and the presence of the practical Lord (Eph. 5:26; 6:17-18). If we abide in the Lord&rsquo;s constant and written word, His instant and living words will abide in us (John 8:31; 15:7; 1 John 2:14). We abide in Him and His words abide in us so that we may speak in Him and He may speak in us for the building of God into man and man into God (John 15:7; 2 Cor. 2:17; 13:3; 1 Cor. 14:4b).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will continue to consider the aspects of Christ as our abiding place.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Abiding in Him That We May Have Boldness<br />
and Not Be Put to Shame from Him at His Coming</h2>
<p>First John 2:28 says, &ldquo;Now, little children, abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.&rdquo; Here the pronoun <em>He</em> refers definitely to Christ the Son, who is coming. This, with the preceding clause <em>abide in Him,</em> which is a repetition of the clause in verse 27 involving the Trinity, indicates that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, inseparable from the Father or the Spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 28 indicates that some believers, those who do not abide in the Lord (that is, remain in the fellowship of the divine life according to pure faith in Christ&rsquo;s person) but are led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ (v. 26), will be punished by being put to shame from Him, from His glorious parousia. When the Lord comes back, we must be found abiding in Him; otherwise, we will be put to shame. If we do not abide in the Triune God, continually living the divine life, then at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back we will suffer shame, which will be a kind of discipline exercised upon us. Then we will be kept away from His glory.</p>
<p>If we abide in Christ and bear much fruit by His life to glorify God, when He is manifested, we will boldly meet Him and not be put to shame from His glorious presence (cf. Matt. 25:30). If we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we spontaneously walk before the Lord and live in His will. This will cause us to have boldness and not be put to shame at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Otherwise, when we see Him, we will be in fear and become separated from His presence. Such danger should warn us to live in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>If we do not abide in the Lord according to the anointing, we will &ldquo;be put to shame from Him at His coming&rdquo; (1 John 2:28). To feel shameful is one thing; to be put to shame is another. This verse does not say that we will feel shameful, but that we will &ldquo;be put to shame.&rdquo; Notice that, according to the Greek, it does not say &ldquo;before Him&rdquo; but &ldquo;from Him.&rdquo; The Greek preposition here is <em>apo,</em> which means &ldquo;away from.&rdquo; If we abide in the Lord according to the anointing, when He appears, we will have confidence, assurance, boldness, and peace and not be put away from Him. Literally, the Greek words translated &ldquo;at His coming&rdquo; mean &ldquo;in His presence.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;presence&rdquo; is <em>parousia,</em> which includes the meaning of coming. We may have His coming and yet not be in His presence. The Lord Jesus will come, but will we be worthy to be in His presence? If we live in a worldly way, loving the world and not giving the Lord the first place, how can we be brought into His presence when He comes? We must abide in the Lord according to the inward anointing so that we may have confidence, boldness, and assurance before Him in His presence at His appearing and not be put to shame away from Him.</p>
<p>At His appearing, the Lord will deal with His believers. To be put to shame away from Him must mean to be put to the place of shame outside His presence. A believer who is put to shame away from Him is not lost. He is still a saved person, but he must suffer being put to shame, which will be a dealing and a discipline for him. It will be the chastisement exercised by the sovereign Lord over His defeated believers. This matter is quite clear and is very serious.</p>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s wife was saved from destruction, but she became a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:15-17, 26; Luke 17:32). In the form of powder, salt is useful. But when salt becomes a block, it is useless. That Lot&rsquo;s wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame. Today Christianity helps people only to take care of the matter of salvation or perdition. But the Bible reveals that besides the matter of salvation or perdition, there is the matter of glory or shame. Lot&rsquo;s wife was not lost; she was saved from destruction. Eventually, however, she became a shame. Hence, the Lord said in Luke 17:32, &ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; warning us that, although we are saved, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back we might possibly suffer shame like Lot&rsquo;s wife. Although we are saved, we may become ashamed at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (1 John 2:28).</p><h2 class="head4">g. Our Not Sinning Habitually<br />
When We Abide in Him Who Was Manifested<br />
to Take Away Sins and Destroy<br />
the Works of the Devil</h2>
<p>First John 3:5 says, &ldquo;You know that He was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;take&rdquo; in verse 5 is the same Greek word as in John 1:29, where we are told that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, which came into the world through Adam (Rom. 5:12). In 1 John 3:5 He takes away sins, which are committed by all men. John 1 deals with the totality of sin, including the sinful nature and sinful deeds. First John 3 deals only with the fruits of sin, that is, the sins committed in man&rsquo;s daily life. Both are taken away by Christ.</p>
<p>In that One who takes away both sin (the sinful nature) and sins (sinful deeds), sin is not. Hence, He did not know sin (2 Cor. 5:21), He committed no sin (1 Pet. 2:22), and He was without sin (Heb. 4:15). This qualified Him to take away both the indwelling sin and the sins committed in man&rsquo;s daily life. We do not sin habitually when we abide in Him, who was manifested to take away sins and undo, destroy, the works of the devil.</p>
<p>In 1 John 3:6 John continues, &ldquo;Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him.&rdquo; The expression <em>abides in Him</em> refers to remaining in the fellowship of the divine life and walking in the divine light (1:2-3, 6-7). The words <em>does not sin</em> in the same verse mean &ldquo;does not sin habitually.&rdquo; This too is a condition of the life that abides in the Lord. It does not mean that the children of God do not commit sin at all; they may commit sin occasionally. It means that the regenerated believers who have the divine life and live by it do not practice sin. Their character and habit are not to sin but to abide in the Lord. Abiding in the Lord is a believer&rsquo;s living; sinning is a sinner&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>In 1 John 3:6, John says that everyone who practices sin, living a sinful life, has not seen Him or known Him. Not to have seen or known the Lord is not to have received any vision of Him or to have any realization of Him. This is the condition of an unbeliever. But if we have experienced the Lord, then we have seen Him and known Him. To see and know the Lord is to experience Him.</p>
<p>In verse 7 John says, &ldquo;Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.&rdquo; To practice righteousness is to live a righteous life, to live rightly under the principle of God&rsquo;s ruling. This, according to verse 8, means not to practice sin and, according to verse 4, not to practice lawlessness.</p>
<p>According to the context, <em>righteous</em> here equals <em>pure</em> in verse 3. To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is pure. The emphasis of the apostle John is that as long as we are children of God having the divine life and the divine nature, we will habitually live a life of righteousness.</p>
<p>In verse 8 John goes on to say, &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.&rdquo; This verse indicates that <em>practices sin</em> (v. 4) and <em>sins</em> in this book are synonymous, denoting to live in sin, to commit sin habitually. Such a life is of the devil, whose life is one of sin and who sins habitually from the beginning. Sin is his nature, and sinning is his character. The devil has sinned from the beginning, that is, from the time when the devil began to rebel against God, attempting to overthrow God&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>In this verse John says that the Son of God was manifested for the purpose of undoing the works of the devil. The Greek word translated &ldquo;for this&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;unto this,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;to this end,&rdquo; or &ldquo;for this purpose.&rdquo; The devil has sinned continually from ancient times and begets sinners to practice sin with him. Hence, for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the sinful deeds of the devil, that is, condemn, through His death on the cross in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), sin initiated by him, the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the devil (Heb. 2:14); and take away both sin and sins. On the cross Christ condemned sin, took away sin and sins, and destroyed the power of the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. When We Keep His Commandments and<br />
Walk as He Walked, Our Abiding in Him and He in Us<br />
and Our Knowing That He Abides in Us<br />
by the Spirit Whom He Gave to Us</h2>
<p>In 1 John 2:5 we are told that &ldquo;whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected. In this we know that we are in Him.&rdquo; Here <em>word</em> is synonymous with <em>commandments</em> in verses 3 and 4. <em>Word</em> here comprises all the commandments. <em>Commandments</em> emphasizes injunction; <em>word</em> implies spirit and life as a supply to us (John 6:63).</p>
<p>The word in verse 5 is the totality, the aggregate, of all the commandments. No matter how many commandments there may be, as a whole these commandments are the word of the Lord. Hence, John speaks of keeping His word. By this he means keeping the word spoken either by the Lord Himself directly or spoken through the apostles.</p>
<p>In verse 5 the expression <em>in Him</em> means <em>in the Lord Jesus Christ</em> (cf. v. 1). This is a strong expression, stressing that we are one with the Lord. Since we are one with the Lord, who is God, the loving essence of God becomes ours. It is supplied to us by the Lord&rsquo;s word of life for our walk of love that we may enjoy the fellowship of the divine life and abide in the divine light (v. 10).</p>
<p>If we read the context of these verses, we will realize that it is an important matter to have a sign indicating that we are in the Lord. How can we prove that we are in the Triune God? The first sign that we are truly in Him is that we know God experientially in our daily life.</p>
<p>Because we know our God in this way, we cannot speak certain things, do certain things, or go certain places. Others may even defame us and falsely accuse us. However, because we know God subjectively, often we will not have any desire to vindicate ourselves or argue in our own defense. No matter what others may say, we know that we have the divine life. We have God within us as our life and nature. Eventually this indwelling One will be expressed in our character and conduct. It is in this way that we know God experientially, and this knowing is a strong sign that we are in Him and one with Him.</p>
<p>In our behavior and way of speaking, we should bear a sign that we are in God. We should not talk with others the same way that unbelievers do. We all should have the testimony in our daily life that we are in God. We bear a sign that we are in God, even though at some times we are weak and fail Him. The sign that in our daily walk we are in God is an indication that we know the Lord experientially. Because we know Him experientially, spontaneously we keep His commandments.</p>
<p>To be in the Lord Jesus Christ is to be one with Him organically. It is not to be one with Him merely in a doctrinal way. When we are organically one with the Lord, He is our life and even becomes our nature. Every kind of life has its particular nature. With the nature of the divine life there is a certain taste. Because we have the Lord as our life and because we enjoy His nature, we also have the taste that comes with the divine nature, and we simply cannot do certain things. However, anyone who does not have the divine nature cannot have the divine taste.</p>
<p>In verse 6 John goes on to say, &ldquo;He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk even as He walked.&rdquo; To be in Christ is the beginning of the Christian life. Our being put in Christ was God&rsquo;s doing once for all (1 Cor. 1:30). To abide in Christ is the continuation of the Christian life. This is our responsibility in our daily walk, a walk that is a copy of Christ&rsquo;s walk on earth. To abide in Christ, on the one hand, we must be according to the teaching of the anointing of the Holy Spirit inwardly, and on the other hand, we must walk as the Lord walked outwardly.</p>
<p>Because God has put us in Christ once for all, we now must bear the responsibility to abide in Him. To abide in Him is actually to have fellowship with Him. On the negative side, this requires that we deal with our sins; on the positive side, this requires that we keep His word.</p>
<p>First John 3:24 says, &ldquo;He who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&rdquo; This verse is the conclusion of this section, which begins in 2:28, on our abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing, as unfolded in the preceding section (vv. 20-27). This section reveals that abiding in the Lord is the living of the children of God by His eternal life as the divine seed (3:15, 9), which grows in the practicing of the righteousness of their begetting God (2:29; 3:7, 10) and the love of their begetting Father (vv. 10-11, 14-23). Such an abiding and its bases&mdash;the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed&mdash;are mysterious yet real in the Spirit.</p>
<p>To keep His commandments is to live a life according to the divine reality. This is what it means to keep the Lord&rsquo;s commandments according to this Epistle. This means that keeping His commandments is not the keeping of the Mosaic law. To keep the commandments of the Lord is to have a life according to the divine reality.</p>
<p>If we keep the Lord&rsquo;s commandments by living in the divine reality, we will abide in Him, and He in us. We abide in the Lord; then He abides in us. Our abiding in Him is a condition for His abiding in us (John 15:4). We enjoy His abiding in us by our abiding in Him.</p>
<p>God is the One who gave the commandments. These commandments are that we must believe in His Son and that we must love one another. We need to have the faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and we need to have the love to love all the brothers. This is what it means to abide in God. This is a living that includes the main things of our Christian life. As long as we believe in Christ and love all other Christians as our brothers, we are abiding in God and are complete. We abide in God because we are keeping His commandments, which charge us to believe in His Son and to love all the brothers of His Son. This is also to have faith and love.</p>
<p>The Spirit, that is, the all-inclusive, compound life-giving Spirit, is the vital and crucial factor of abiding in the Lord. It is by this Spirit that we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in the Lord. This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament (Gal. 3:14); He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally (John 3:31-35). This Spirit and the eternal life (1 John 3:15) are the basic elements by which we live the life that abides in the Lord continuously. Hence, it is by this Spirit, who witnesses assuringly with our spirit, that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16) and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us (1 John 4:13). It is through this Spirit that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). And it is by this Spirit that we enjoy the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).</p>
<p>We abide in God by the Spirit of God (1 John 3:24b). Without the Spirit of God, there is no connection between God and us. The linking, the connection, between us and God, the Father, the Son, the Lord, and Christ, is the Spirit. This &ldquo;linking Spirit&rdquo; is in our spirit. If we would enjoy a life of abiding in God, we must exercise our spirit, turn to our spirit, touch our spirit, and use our spirit. Then we will touch the linking Spirit. This is a mutual abiding. This mutual abiding is altogether a story in spirit. When God abides in us, He abides in our spirit; when we abide in God, we abide in His Spirit.</p>
<p>In 1 John 4:13, John says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&rdquo; In that God has given to us of His Spirit, we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us (James 4:5; Rom. 8:9, 11), is the witness in our spirit (v. 16), witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us. The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. By Him we are assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually. This is evidenced by our living, a living in which we love one another habitually with His love (1 John 4:12).</p>
<p>In verse 13 John indicates that we may know that we abide in Him. To abide in God is to dwell in Him, to remain in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us. This is to practice our oneness with God according to the divine anointing (2:27) by living a life that practices His righteousness and His love. It is all carried out by the operation of the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who dwells in our spirit and who is the basic element of the divine anointing.</p>
<p>John 15 says that the Lord is the true vine and that the believers are the branches. As such, the believers need to abide in the vine. Because of the way this is said, it may appear that this is an illustration. But 1 John 4:13 is definitely a fact: &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit given by God who abides in us is the witness in our spirit, testifying that we abide in God and that God abides in us. Here man is mingled with God. This is the principle of incarnation. In the universe there is at least One among all of God&rsquo;s creation, Jesus of Nazareth, who is a product of the two natures of God and man. He is God, yet He is also man. He is the God-man. God is not only with Him but also mingled with Him. They share the same life, the same living, the same move, and the same work. Thus, in heaven or on earth, the Lord Jesus walks and works together with God. This oneness is not only one of being alongside each other but one of being mingled with each other.</p>
<p>We can abide in Christ, making Him our dwelling place. He can abide in us, making us His abode. Likewise, the mutual abiding of Christ with the believers is a matter of mingling. When we abide in Christ and let Him abide in us, we are mingled together. This is possible because He is the Spirit and because we have a spirit. These two spirits are joined in one (1 Cor. 6:17). We are mingled with Christ because He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) and we have a spirit. One day these two spirits were blended to become the mingled spirit. Consequently, we were mingled with Christ.</p>
<p>To abide is to remain in the mingled spirit. Within us is our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. This part of us must become our home. Both Christ and we live here. We must remain in our mingled spirit, making it our home. As long as He and we both have our dwelling place in this mingled spirit, we spontaneously live Christ and enjoy the fellowship of life, the flowing of the divine life.</p>
<p>To live Christ is the issue of our abiding in Him and His abiding in us. He and we both make home in the same place, the mingled spirit. He and we are mingled as one spirit. This mingled spirit is our joint abode. This is what makes us joyful, living, and uplifted. We are in the mingled spirit, and this is our home.</p>
<p>In 1 John 4:13, John also says that God &ldquo;has given to us of His Spirit.&rdquo; Here the Greek word translated &ldquo;of&rdquo; means &ldquo;out of.&rdquo; God has given us out of His Spirit. This closely resembles, and almost repeats, the word in 3:24, which proves that this does not mean that God has given us something of His Spirit, such as the various gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:4, but that He has given the Spirit Himself as the all-inclusive gift (Acts 2:38). <em>Out of His Spirit</em> is an expression that implies that the Spirit of God, whom God has given to us, is bountiful and without measure (Phil. 1:19; John 3:34). By such a bountiful, immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other.</p>
<p>God has given us something of the Spirit, which indicates that all the riches of Christ are now the content of the Spirit. Eventually, what God has given us is the complete, consummated, all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit. Our God, the Father, has given us of this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the bountiful supply of Jesus Christ, the Son.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">116. Our Life and Our Victory</h2>
<p>In 1 John 5 we see Christ as our life and our victory.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Everyone Who Believes That Jesus<br />
Is the Christ Having Been Begotten of God</h2>
<p>First John 5:1 says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God.&rdquo; We must believe that Jesus is the Christ sent by God to be our Savior before we can obtain the life of God. We do not need to do anything but believe this in order for the Holy Spirit to enter into us, give us God&rsquo;s life, and cause us to be regenerated, to be born of God. Whoever believes that the man Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate (John 1:1, 14; 20:31), has been begotten of God and has become a child of God (1:12-13). Our being begotten of God is the base of our enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Everything That Has Been Begotten of God Overcoming the World, and This Being the Victory Which Overcomes the World</h2>
<p>First John 5:4-5 continues, &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world&mdash;our faith. And who is he who overcomes the world except him who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&rdquo; The word <em>everything</em> in verse 4 refers to every person who has been begotten of God. Yet such an expression should refer especially to that part, that is, the spirit of the regenerated person, that has been regenerated with the divine life (John 3:6). The regenerated spirit of the regenerated believer does not practice sin (1 John 3:9) and overcomes the world. The believer&rsquo;s divine birth with the divine life is the basic factor for such victorious living.</p>
<p>Both in his Gospel and in this Epistle John stressed the divine birth (John 1:13; 3:3, 5; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18), through which the divine life is imparted into the believers in Christ (John 3:15-16, 36; 1 John 5:11-12). This divine birth, which brings in the divine life, is the basic factor of all the mysteries concerning the divine life, such as the fellowship of the divine life (1:3-7), the anointing of the Divine Trinity (2:20-27), the abiding in the Lord (v. 28&mdash;3:24), and the divine living that practices the divine truth (1:6), the divine will (2:17), the divine righteousness (v. 29; 3:7), and the divine love (vv. 11, 22-23; 5:1-3) to express the divine Person (4:12). The divine birth with the divine life assures the God-begotten believers, giving them confidence in the ability and virtue of the divine life.</p>
<p>Regeneration takes place definitely and particularly in our spirit. John 3:6 says that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. This indicates that regeneration takes place in our spirit. Because our spirit has been regenerated, it cannot sin. On the contrary, our spirit can overcome all negative things.</p>
<p>Our spirit has been regenerated with the divine life. This means that the divine life has been imparted, or infused, into our spirit. Regenerated believers have the capability in the divine life to overcome the world, the powerful satanic world system. Regarding overcoming the world, we should not trust in our own ability or effort. Instead, we need to trust our spirit. Our spirit is well able to overcome Satan and the world, the evil system. But in ourselves we cannot overcome the world. When we exercise our spirit, stay in our spirit, and walk by our spirit, we will see that our spirit has the life ability to overcome all negative things. This is why we need to exercise our spirit to have fellowship with the Lord and pray concerning the enjoyment of the Lord. We also need to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and to pray-read the Word. This exercise stirs up the ability in our spirit to overcome the world.</p>
<p>It is the divine life in our spirit that has the ability to overcome the evil, satanic world. We are surrounded by temptations. What can overcome them? The divine life in our spirit can overcome temptation. We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world.</p>
<p>Although we have been born of God, according to our experience we still commit sins. After a person has been saved through regeneration, experientially speaking, he still can sin. Even 1 John says that to this day we still have the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life (2:16). Why is it then that chapter 3 says, &ldquo;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin&rdquo; (v. 9)?</p>
<p>The only thing in the universe that has been begotten of God is our spirit. Our flesh and our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will, were not begotten of God. No one can deny that the spirit in us has been begotten of God. Our flesh as well as our mind can sin, but our regenerated spirit cannot practice sin. In fact, while our flesh is sinning, our regenerated spirit continually admonishes us not to sin. There is only one place in this universe that has been reserved by God and does not have Satan&rsquo;s footprints on it&mdash;our regenerated spirit. Satan cannot cross this boundary to reach us. How we need to take refuge in this high tower!</p>
<p>Our regenerated spirit, as that which has been begotten of God, keeps us from sinning. We can testify that many times we have been kept by this spirit, which has been begotten of God. We all are vile sinners and are capable of committing gross sins, yet our regenerated spirit has kept us. In our spirit we are safe from the evil one. This is our hiding place, our refuge, and our high tower. To this place we flee whenever Satan comes. If we find our temper flaring, we must not struggle to keep it under control. Instead of fighting to keep our self-control, we must withdraw to our spirit. This is our refuge.</p>
<p>The writings of Paul have this same thought, expressed in different terms. Galatians 5:17 says, &ldquo;The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.&rdquo; The word <em>Spirit</em> here refers to the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit. There is a part of our being, the flesh, which is against another part, our spirit. In verse 16 Paul exhorts us to walk by the Spirit in order that we may not fulfill the lust of the flesh. We must not stay in our flesh but abide in our spirit, the part of our being which is born of God. Romans 8:4 also tells us that we are not to &ldquo;walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.&rdquo; Within us we have not only a spirit, which has been born of God, but also the flesh, which was born of the fallen nature. We must choose to walk in the part that has been born of God, does not and cannot sin, overcomes the world, loves what God loves, and keeps us from the evil one.</p>
<p>Now that we have been born of God in our spirit, we must remain in our spirit. We should not try to do anything outside of our spirit. We should not attempt to do anything in our soul-life. We should not try to solve our problems by using our mind, act in our emotions, or rely on our will. The only part within us that counts in God&rsquo;s eyes is our spirit, which has been born of God. This divine birth brings the divine life and nature into our spirit.</p>
<p>We should keep returning to our spirit. We should not take any action outside of our spirit. We should not even think about loving or hating, about doing good or doing evil. We should make sure only that we are in our spirit. When we need to love someone, we should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Bring me into my spirit so that I can love this person.&rdquo; We need to pray continually, &ldquo;Lord, keep me in my spirit.&rdquo; If you are a student, when you read textbooks, study assignments, or attend classes, you should stay in your spirit. As long as we abide in our spirit, we overcome the world, we do not sin, and we can do what the Father would do and love what He would love.</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:4b, John says, &ldquo;This is the victory which has overcome the world&mdash;our faith.&rdquo; This is the faith that brings us into the organic union with the Triune God and that believes that Jesus is the Son of God (v. 5) that we may be begotten of God and have His divine life, by which we are enabled to overcome the Satan-organized-and-usurped world. Faith is the substantiation of the unseen, divine, and spiritual things (Heb. 11:1); this substantiating power overcomes the world.</p>
<p>Actually, our trust should not be in our faith itself. The faith by itself does not overcome the world. Our faith brings us into an organic union, and it is this organic union, not the faith directly, that overcomes the world. We may say that faith is the means for us to be united with the Triune God. By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are brought into an organic union with the Triune God; this union, produced by faith, then overcomes the world.</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:5, John continues, &ldquo;And who is he who overcomes the world except him who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&rdquo; Such a believer is one who has been begotten of God and has received the divine life (John 1:12-13; 3:16). The divine life empowers him to overcome the evil world energized by Satan. The Gnostics and the Cerinthians, who were not believers of this kind, remained pitiful victims of the evil satanic system. But our believing that Jesus is the Son of God brings us into an organic union with the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. It is this organic union with the Triune God in the Son that overcomes the world.</p><h2 class="head4">c. His Coming through Water, Blood,<br />
and the Spirit, Who Is the Reality</h2>
<p>First John 5:6 through 8 say, &ldquo;This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the reality. For there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one thing.&rdquo; Here we see that Jesus came through water, blood, and the Spirit who is the reality. The reality here refers to the reality of all that Christ as the Son of God is (John 16:12-15).</p>
<p>He, Jesus Christ, came as the Son of God that we might be born of God and have the divine life (10:10; 20:31). It is in His Son that God gives us eternal life (1 John 5:11-13). Jesus, the man of Nazareth, was attested to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism (Matt. 3:16-17; John 1:31), by the blood He shed on the cross (19:31-35; Matt. 27:50-54), and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure (John 1:32-34; 3:34). By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us (1 John 5:7-10), that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name (vv. 11-13; John 3:16, 36; 20:31). The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life (Rom. 8:2), germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation, by regenerating them with the divine life. Thus they are born of God and become His children (John 3:5, 15; 1:12-13) and live a life that practices the truth (1 John 1:6), the will of God (2:17), the righteousness of God (v. 29), and the love of God (3:10-11) for His expression.</p>
<p>By these three steps of termination, redemption, and germination, Jesus Christ not only has been testified as the Son of God but also has entered into us. Through the water of His baptism, through the blood of His cross, and as the Spirit, Christ has been testified as the Son of God and has come into our spirit. This means that by termination, redemption, and germination, Christ is now within us. We are a terminated, redeemed, and germinated people. We are no longer the old creation; we are the new creation with the new birth and a new life. Because we are the children of God, we have the life ability to overcome the world and all negative things.</p>
<p>First John 5:6-8 says that God testified that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. God testified this in three steps: by water, by the blood, and by the Spirit. Christ came through water at His baptism, blood at His crucifixion, and the Spirit who is the reality at His resurrection. The water refers to the baptism of the Lord Jesus. According to the record of the four Gospels, immediately after the Lord came up from the water, the heavens were opened and a voice declared that He is God&rsquo;s beloved Son. This was God&rsquo;s testimony that Jesus Christ is His Son, the testimony by water, by baptism. Three and a half years later, the Lord Jesus died on the cross, shedding His blood. The centurion standing near the cross testified, after the Lord died, &ldquo;Truly this man was the Son of God&rdquo; (Mark 15:39; Matt. 27:54). That was the testimony of God by the blood shed on the cross concerning Jesus Christ being the Son of God. Following this, we have the testimony of the Spirit. In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit. In Romans 1:4 Christ was designated the Son of God in resurrection according to the Spirit of holiness. Accordingly, the anointing Spirit constantly witnesses that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Therefore, there are three occasions&mdash;His baptism, crucifixion, and resurrection&mdash;that testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who is qualified to be our life for our divine birth that we may overcome the world.</p>
<p>Whenever the New Testament uses the title <em>the Son of God,</em> its significance always involves the imparting of the divine life. The Son of God was manifested for the purpose of imparting the divine life (1 John 5:11-13). The Son of God came that we might have life (John 10:10). But He came in a way that puzzled people. He appeared as a Nazarene with no outward honor and with nothing to command respect. Yet Jesus was manifested as the Son of God in an open way by the water of baptism, by the blood He shed on the cross, and by the Spirit. By these three means God introduced His Son to mankind that they might believe and have eternal life.</p>
<p>The baptism of Jesus testifies of the termination of the old creation. We all need to be buried, that is, terminated. God does not want the old creation. Whether we consider ourselves good or bad, precious or worthless, God declares that we all are worthy of nothing but death and burial. The water of baptism testifies of God&rsquo;s judgment that we and the rest of the old creation need to be terminated.</p>
<p>The blood is for redemption. From the old creation, which needs to be terminated, a part has been predestinated by God unto the divine sonship (Eph. 1:4-5). This part needs to be redeemed to Him. When Jesus died on the cross, His all-inclusive death terminated all the old creation, including the old man and the flesh. At the same time, He shed His blood to redeem those whom God had chosen and predestinated.</p>
<p>The Spirit germinates. We have been terminated on the cross, but we were chosen to be holy and predestinated unto sonship before the foundation of the world. Because God chose and predestinated us, He redeemed us. However, we were lifeless because we were terminated. When the Spirit came, He caused the seed of the divine life, the Son of God, to germinate within us. The Holy Spirit today is the Spirit of life. This life is the germinating seed within us.</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:6, John says that the Spirit testifies because the Spirit is the truth. The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality (John 14:16-17; 15:26), testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life. By thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life (Col. 3:4).</p>
<p>We have been terminated, redeemed, and germinated. This life germ within us should be the source of our life and all our actions, even our breathing. First John focuses on the life germ, not on outward doing. The Lord Jesus has come to us in water, terminating us; in the blood, redeeming us; and in the Spirit, germinating us. Once we see that we have been terminated, that God has chosen and redeemed us, and that He desires to bring to fruitfulness the life He has germinated in us, we will cease from our doing. As He lives, we will live with Him. As He moves, we move with Him. As He works, we work with Him.</p><h2 class="head4">d.God Giving to Us Eternal Life and<br />
This Life Being in Him and Even Being Himself</h2>
<p>In 1 John 5:11-12 we are told that &ldquo;this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; God gave to us His eternal life, and this life is in Christ, the Son of God, and is even Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son. His Son is the means through which He gives us His eternal life, which is His goal for us. Because the life is in the Son (John 1:4) and the Son is the life (11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4), the Son and the life are one, inseparable. If we have the Son of God, we have eternal life, because eternal life is in the Son. We may say that the Son is a container of eternal life. When we receive the Son by believing in Him, we have eternal life. Hence, he who has the Son has the life, and he who does not have the Son does not have the life.</p>
<p>We may say that eternal life, the divine life, is the &ldquo;capital&rdquo; of our Christian life. Actually, this eternal life is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God. By this we see that eternal life is the Triune God. Now the Triune God is moving and working within us as the anointing. This anointing is also the moving of eternal life. Eternal life is not a thing; it is a person who is the embodiment of the Triune God. Now this person is moving within us to anoint us with Himself, that is, with eternal life and with the essence of this life, which is the Triune God. The Triune God is the content, the essence, of eternal life. Therefore, when eternal life anoints us, it anoints us with the Triune God. This gives us the basis and the means to live a life that practices the divine righteousness, practices the divine love, and overcomes the world, death, sin, the devil, and idols.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy teaches that eternal life is the embodiment of the Triune God and that this life is anointing us with the essence of the Triune God. Eventually, through continuous anointing, we will become the same in life and nature as the Triune God, in that His essence will become ours, making us the same as He. Then we will live a life full of righteousness and love, a life that spontaneously overcomes the world, death, sin, the devil, and idols. There is no need for us to try to live such a life. As long as we dwell in the fellowship of eternal life according to the anointing, we will spontaneously practice righteousness and love and simultaneously overcome all negative things.</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:13, John says, &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.&rdquo; The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers, who believe into the name of the Son of God, that they have eternal life. Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the holy writings are the assurance concerning this fact&mdash;they are the title deed to our eternal salvation. By them we are assured and have the pledge that as long as we believe into the name of the Son of God, we have eternal life.</p>
<p>The word of the Bible is the pledge of eternal life. The Bible is also the title deed of our salvation. This is why the Bible is called a covenant, or testament. We not only have the fact of eternal life; we also have the pledge, the guarantee, the title deed, to prove that we have eternal life. We should praise the Lord that we have salvation and eternal life and also the title deed to prove it!</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Everyone Who Has Been Begotten of God Not Sinning, but He Who Is Begotten of God Keeping Himself,<br />
and the Evil One Not Touching Him</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin, but he who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.&rdquo; According to the context of chapter 5, the word <em>he</em> in this verse refers to our regenerated spirit. This indicates that our spirit has been regenerated and that this regenerated spirit keeps itself from the touch of the evil one.</p>
<p>Sin interrupts the fellowship of the divine life (1:6-10) and may even bring in physical death (5:16-17). In order that we might avoid sinning, the apostle John assures us of the capability of the divine life and stresses our divine birth, which is the basis of the victorious life. The basic fact of our divine birth prevents us, the regenerated ones, from practicing sin (3:9), that is, from living in sin (Rom. 6:2).</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:18 John says that everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin. Then he says that he who is begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him. Regenerated persons can keep themselves from sinning. Their divine birth with the divine life in their spirit is the basic factor of such a safeguard.</p>
<p>This understanding of the pronoun <em>he</em> in verse 18 is supported by John&rsquo;s word in verse 4: &ldquo;For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, this verse refers to our regenerated spirit. It is this regenerated spirit that keeps us from sinning.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says that the evil one does not touch the one who has been begotten of God and who keeps himself. Here <em>touch</em> means &ldquo;to grasp, to lay hold of, for doing harm and fulfilling evil purposes.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;evil one&rdquo; is <em>poneros.</em> This word differs from <em>kakos,</em> which refers to an essentially worthless and wicked character, and also differs from <em>sapros,</em> which indicates worthlessness and corruption, degeneracy from original virtue. The Greek word <em>poneros</em> means one who is pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious. Such an evil one is Satan the devil, in whom the whole world lies (v. 19).</p>
<p>At least one version says, &ldquo;The evil one cannot touch him.&rdquo; To say that the evil one cannot touch you is different from saying that the evil one does not touch you. The correct translation is, &ldquo;The evil one does not touch him.&rdquo; The thought here is not that the evil one is not able to touch us; the thought is that the evil one does not touch us. Here John is saying that as long as we abide in our regenerated spirit, this spirit will keep us from sinning, and the evil one does not touch us. He knows that if he tries to touch us when we are abiding in our regenerated spirit, he will accomplish nothing. Hence, the thought here is not that the evil one cannot touch us, but that he does not touch us when we are in spirit. We know from experience that when we are in the flesh, forgetting our regenerated spirit, we become prey to the evil one. The evil one will not only touch us&mdash;he will devour us. But when we are in our regenerated spirit, he will not waste his time with us.</p>
<p>The thought in verse 18 is that we have been born of God and have the divine life. This divine birth took place in our regenerated spirit, and now the divine life is in our regenerated spirit. Therefore, we should simply stay in our regenerated spirit. Regeneration with the divine birth and the divine life keeps us from sin, failure, and defilement. When we stay in our regenerated spirit, Satan knows that there is no way for him to touch us, and he will not try to touch us. As long as we stay in our regenerated spirit, we are in a refuge, a place of protection and safeguard, and the evil one does not touch us.</p>
<p>Christians often complain about how strong the devil is. But John&rsquo;s writings tell us that we have been begotten of God and that the devil does not touch us. The devil knows that his efforts will be in vain if he tries to touch one who has been begotten of God and who is keeping himself.</p>
<p>John also tells us that the whole world lies in the evil one (v. 19). The world includes the events, things, and people of the world. In God&rsquo;s eyes the whole world, including all human beings and societies, are under the hand of Satan. The only exception is our regenerated spirit. We should not think that the unbelievers are under the authority of Satan and that we are not. Our mind may be still under Satan&rsquo;s authority, but our regenerated spirit is not. Actually, even our reading of the Word and our prayer may be under Satan&rsquo;s authority because they may come not out of our regenerated spirit but out of our mind, emotion, and preference. Aside from our regenerated spirit, all the other parts of our being may be under the hand of Satan.</p>
<p>Consider the day that the Lord Jesus went to the little house in Bethany, where He fellowshipped with His disciples. While the high priest was offering sacrifices and burning incense in the temple in Jerusalem, God was not there&mdash;He was in the house in Bethany. The high priest&rsquo;s service, the burning of the incense, and the worship in the temple were under the hand of the evil one. For this reason, although the Jews were worshipping God and learning the Scriptures in their synagogues, the Lord Jesus said that those who called themselves Jews are actually &ldquo;a synagogue of Satan&rdquo; (Rev. 2:9; 3:9). Although the Jews worshipped God, studied the Scriptures, and served God in their synagogues, God was not there. When the Lord spoke those words, He was in the believers&rsquo; spirit, today&rsquo;s Bethany, where He fellowships with them. This indicates that any worship or service that is without the Lord Spirit is of the devil. This is a solemn matter.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether the Lord is in our prayer, our reading of the Bible, and our bread-breaking meeting. If we are not in the spirit, then the Lord is not in these things, and all these things are still under Satan&rsquo;s hand. Not only are immoral and worldly entertainments under Satan&rsquo;s hand, but even our reading of the Word, our prayer, and our attending church meetings can be under Satan&rsquo;s hand unless they are done in the spirit. This is because the only thing in the universe that does not have Satan in it is our regenerated spirit. Unless we are in our spirit, whatever we do is under Satan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Today God is in our spirit; our spirit is God&rsquo;s Holy of Holies. The three parts of our being&mdash;our spirit, our soul, and our body&mdash;correspond to the three parts of the tabernacle: the Holy of Holies, the Holy Place, and the outer court. Our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and God&rsquo;s habitation in the heavens is also the Holy of Holies. These two realms are connected. Only our regenerated spirit as the Holy of Holies is not under the authority of Satan. Besides our regenerated spirit, everything else in the universe has been defiled by Satan.</p>
<p>In the universe God has drawn a boundary around one thing&mdash;our spirit. God has set a limit for Satan, forbidding him to transgress this boundary. As long as we remain in our regenerated spirit, we will be kept, and Satan will have no way in us and cannot harm or touch us. Only our regenerated spirit is not under Satan&rsquo;s hand. Besides this, everything else, including our flesh, our mind, our emotion, and our will, are all under Satan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the totality of all the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirits is the church. The church is not in a physical building. The church is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). The church is God&rsquo;s Holy of Holies because the church is the aggregate of our regenerated spirits in which God dwells. Therefore, when we pray, read the Word, worship God, and serve Him, we must be in our spirit and in the church. Satan cannot touch the church as the aggregate of our spirits. He knows that whenever he touches that church, he suffers a loss.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

an Understanding That We May Know the True God and Be in the True God, That Is, in Him Who Is<br />
the True God and Eternal Life</h2>
<p>First John 5:20-21 says, &ldquo;We know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; Christ has come and has given us an understanding that we may know the true God and be in the true God, that is, in Him who is the true God and eternal life. The Son is the Father (Isa. 9:6), and the Son of God is God (Heb. 1:8). Therefore, the expressions <em>Him who is true</em> and <em>the true God</em> in 1 John 5:20 refer to the Divine Trinity. The Triune God is both the true God and eternal life, and now we may enjoy Him as the true God and eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) His Having Come and Having Given Us<br />
an Understanding That We May Know the True God</h2>
<p>The word <em>come</em> in verse 20 indicates that the Son of God has come through incarnation to bring God to us as grace and reality (John 1:14) that we may have the divine life, as revealed in John&rsquo;s Gospel, to partake of God as love and light, as unveiled in this Epistle.</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:20, John says that the Son of God has given us an understanding so that we may know Him who is true, the true One. This understanding is the faculty of our mind enlightened and empowered by the Spirit of reality (John 16:12-15) to apprehend the divine reality in our regenerated spirit. In 1 John 5:20 to &ldquo;know&rdquo; is the ability of the divine life to know the true God (John 17:3) in our regenerated spirit (Eph. 1:17) through our renewed mind, enlightened by the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>The understanding mentioned in 1 John 5:20 involves our mind, our spirit, and the Spirit of reality. According to our natural being, our spirit is deadened, and our mind is darkened. Hence, in our natural being we do not have the ability to know God. It is impossible for a person with a deadened spirit and a darkened mind to know the invisible God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, the Son of God, has come and has given us an understanding that we might know the genuine and real God. He has come to us by the steps of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. He accomplished redemption for us, and when we repented and believed in Him, we received Him. Now that we have believed in and received Him, our sins have been forgiven, our darkened mind has been enlightened, and our deadened spirit has been enlivened. Furthermore, the Spirit of reality, who is the Spirit of revelation, has come into our being. This means that the Spirit of reality has been added to our enlivened spirit and has shined into our mind to enlighten it. Now we have an enlightened mind and an enlivened spirit with the Spirit of reality, who reveals spiritual reality to us. As a result, we surely have an understanding and are able to know the true One. Before we were saved, we did not have this understanding, but the Son of God has come to us and has given us this understanding so that we may know God. This understanding includes our enlightened mind, our enlivened spirit, and the revealing Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>In John 17:2 and 3 we see that eternal life has the ability to know God: &ldquo;Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him. And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Eternal life is the divine life with a special function&mdash;to know God. In order to know God, the divine person, we need the divine life.</p>
<p>Because we as believers have been born of the divine life, we are able to know God. In order to know a certain living thing, a person needs to have the life of that thing. For example, a dog cannot know human beings, because a dog does not have a human life. It takes human life to know human beings. The principle is the same with knowing God. The life of God is certainly able to know God. Therefore, the life of God, which has been given to us, has the ability to know God and the things of God.</p>
<p>In 1 John 5:20 John speaks of knowing the true One. Here the word <em>know</em> actually means &ldquo;experience, enjoy, and possess.&rdquo; Therefore, to know the true One is to experience, enjoy, and possess the true One. In this universe only God Himself is the true One. We need God&rsquo;s life in order to experience, enjoy, and possess Him.</p>
<p>John in verse 20 speaks twice of &ldquo;Him who is true.&rdquo; Another translation would be &ldquo;the true One.&rdquo; To speak of God simply as God may be to speak in a rather objective way. However, the term <em>the true One</em> is subjective; it refers to God becoming subjective to us. In this verse the God who is objective becomes the true One in our life and experience.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the expression <em>the true One</em>? In particular, what does the word <em>true</em> mean? Here the Greek word translated &ldquo;true&rdquo; is <em>alethinos,</em> meaning &ldquo;genuine, real&rdquo; (an adjective akin to <em>aletheia,</em> &ldquo;truth, verity, reality&rdquo;&mdash;John 1:14; 14:6, 17), the opposite of false and counterfeit. Actually, the true One is the reality. The Son of God has given us an understanding so that we may know&mdash;that is, experience, enjoy, and possess&mdash;this divine reality. Therefore, to know the true One means to know the reality by experiencing, enjoying, and possessing this reality.</p>
<p>First John 5:20 indicates that God has become our reality in our experience. The Son of God has come through incarnation, death, and resurrection and has given us an understanding so that we may experience, enjoy, and possess the reality, which is God Himself. Now the God who was once objective to us has become our subjective reality.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Our Being in the True God</h2>
<p>In verse 20 John also says that we are in the true One. We not only know the true God; we are also in Him. We not only have the knowledge of Him; we are in an organic union with Him. We are one with Him organically.</p>
<p>When John says that we are in the true One, he is making a crucial point. Not only do we know the true One and experience, enjoy, and possess Him as the reality, but we also are in this reality. We are in the true One.</p>
<p>John tells us that we are &ldquo;in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ&rdquo; (v. 20). To be in the true God is to be in His Son Jesus Christ. Since Jesus Christ as the Son of God is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), to be in Him is to be in the true God. This indicates that Jesus Christ the Son of God is the true God.</p>
<p>Being in the true One is equal to being in His Son Jesus Christ. This indicates that the true One and Jesus Christ are one in the way of coinherence. Therefore, to be in the Son is spontaneously to be in the true One. Furthermore, we are in the true One by virtue of being in His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) The True God and Eternal Life</h2>
<p>The last part of 1 John 5:20 says, &ldquo;This is the true God and eternal life.&rdquo; The word <em>this</em> refers to the God who has come through incarnation and has given us the ability to know Him as the genuine God and be one with Him organically in His Son Jesus Christ. All this is the genuine and real God and eternal life to us. This genuine and real God is eternal life to us so that we may partake of Him as everything for our regenerated being.</p>
<p>We need to pay special attention to the word <em>this.</em> In verse 20 John does not say &ldquo;He is&rdquo;; he says &ldquo;this is.&rdquo; Furthermore, John uses the word <em>this</em> to refer both to the true God and to eternal life. By this we see that the true God and eternal life are one.</p>
<p>We have seen that we are in the true One and in His Son Jesus Christ. Doctrinally, the true One and His Son Jesus Christ may be considered two. But when we are in the true One and in Jesus Christ experientially, these two are one. For this reason John uses <em>this</em> to refer both to the true One and to His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We have seen that to be in the true One is to be in His Son Jesus Christ. This means that in our experience of being in Them, They are one.</p>
<p>Moreover, when we are in the true One and Jesus Christ, They are our true God and also our eternal life. John speaks first of the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, and then he speaks of the true God. Here there may be some distinction between the true One and the true God. When we are in the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, the true One is called the true God, and His Son Jesus Christ is called eternal life. This means that first They are the true One and His Son Jesus Christ. But when we are in Them, They become the true God and eternal life.</p>
<p>The word <em>this</em> in verse 20 refers to the God who has become experiential to us through our being in Him. No longer are we outside of this God. Rather, we are in this God, and we are in the true One, in His Son Jesus Christ. Because we are in Them, God and Jesus Christ are no longer objective to us, and in our experience They are no longer two. When we are in Them, They become one to us. Therefore, John says that &ldquo;this&rdquo; is the true God, and &ldquo;this&rdquo; is eternal life. &ldquo;This&rdquo; is the God and the Jesus Christ in whom we are. We may also say that &ldquo;this&rdquo; includes the condition of our being in God and Jesus Christ. Hence, the true God and eternal life include our being in the true One and His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>If we are not in God, we cannot say from experience that to us He is true. Of course, He would still be true in Himself, but we could not testify that in us He is true. But since we are in the true One, to us He is the true God. Furthermore, Christ is eternal life to us. If we were not in Him, Christ would still be eternal life in Himself, but He would not be eternal life to us. Because we are now in Him, to us Jesus Christ is eternal life.</p>
<p>In verse 20 we have the crucial conclusion of the entire Epistle of 1 John. This Epistle reveals that now we are truly one with the Triune God, and He becomes true, real, to us. He becomes reality and life to us because we are in Him.</p>
<p>The word <em>this</em> in verse 20 implies that God, Jesus Christ, and eternal life are one. In doctrine, there may be a distinction between God, Christ, and eternal life, but in our experience they are one. When we are in God and in Jesus Christ and when we experience eternal life, we find that all these are one. Therefore, John concludes verse 20 by saying, &ldquo;This is the true God and eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 21 John goes on to say, &ldquo;Little children, guard yourselves from idols.&rdquo; The word <em>guard</em> means to garrison ourselves against attacks from without, like the assaults of the heresies. <em>Idols</em> refers to the heretical substitutes, brought in by the Gnostics and Cerinthians, for the true God, as revealed in this Epistle and in John&rsquo;s Gospel and referred to in the preceding verse. Idols here also refer to anything that replaces the real God. As genuine children of the genuine God, we should be on the alert to guard ourselves from these heretical substitutes and all vain replacements for our genuine and real God, with whom we are organically one and who is eternal life to us. According to John&rsquo;s understanding, an idol is anything that replaces, is a substitute for, the subjective God, the God whom we have experienced and whom we are still experiencing. This is the aged apostle&rsquo;s word of warning to all his little children as a conclusion of his Epistle.</p>
<p>Anything that is a substitute or replacement for the true God and eternal life is an idol. We need to live, walk, and have our being in this God and in this life. Unless we live in the true God and eternal life, we will have a substitute for the true God, and this substitute will be an idol.</p><h2 class="head3">117. The Source of Grace, Mercy, and Peace</h2>
<p>In 2 John, Christ is revealed as the source of grace, mercy, and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. In the Truth That Jesus Christ Came in the Flesh</h2>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> here denotes the divine reality of the gospel, especially concerning the person of Christ, who expressed God and accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose; love is the believers&rsquo; expression in loving one another through receiving and knowing the truth. These two matters are the basic structure of this Epistle. In them grace, mercy, and peace will be with us. The apostle greeted and blessed the believers with grace, mercy, and peace, based on the fact that these two crucial things existed among the believers. When we walk in the truth (v. 4) and love one another (v. 5), we will enjoy the divine grace, mercy, and peace.</p>
<p>If truth and love do not exist among the believers, there is no way for them to enjoy grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ. Grace, mercy, and peace can be unto us only when the basic factors of truth and love are present. All of us need to live a life of truth and love.</p>
<p>Verse 7 continues, &ldquo;For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.&rdquo; The deceivers mentioned here were heretics, like the Cerinthians, the false prophets (1 John 4:1).</p>
<p>These deceivers do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This means that they do not confess that Jesus is God incarnate. Thus, they deny the deity of Christ. Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18). To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that, as the Son of God, He was divinely conceived to be born in the flesh (Luke 1:31-35). The deceivers, the false prophets, would not make such a confession.</p>
<p>John says in 2 John 7 that those who do not confess Jesus coming in the flesh are not only deceivers but also antichrists. An antichrist differs from a false Christ (Matt. 24:5, 24). A false Christ is one who pretends, deceivingly, to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ&rsquo;s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God (1 John 2:22), not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit (4:2-3). Whoever denies the person of Christ is an antichrist.</p>
<p>Anyone who rejects Jesus Christ coming in the flesh rejects His humanity and His human living. Such a one also rejects Christ&rsquo;s redemption. If Christ had not become a man, He could not have had human blood to shed for the redemption of human beings. If He had not become flesh through the conception of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary, He never could have been our Substitute to be crucified to bear our judgment before God. Therefore, to deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is to deny His holy conception, His incarnation, His birth, His humanity, His human living, and also His redemption. The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood (Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:22).</p>
<p>Anyone who rejects Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and thereby rejects His redemption also denies Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. If Christ had never passed through death, it would not have been possible for Him to enter into resurrection.</p>
<p>Denying that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is a great heresy. This heretical teaching makes it impossible to have the enjoyment of the Trinity. According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father. The Son was crucified, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, we have the Spirit as the reality of the Son with the Father. This includes incarnation, human living, redemption by the shedding of human blood, death in a human body, burial, and resurrection. All these are components, constituents, of our enjoyment of the Triune God. If anyone denies Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, that one denies Christ&rsquo;s holy birth, humanity, human living, redemption through crucifixion, and resurrection. This utterly annuls the enjoyment of the genuine Trinity.</p>
<p>We must love all the dear brothers in the divine fellowship, but we must be strict with certain persons. We should not even greet them because they are not in the fellowship and even oppose the fellowship. On the one hand, they claim to be Christians, but on the other hand, they do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was incarnated as a man. Not only are there modernists teaching these things today, but also from the beginning of the church in the first century, before the early apostles had passed away, there was already this kind of persons. In the words of the apostle John, they do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh (2 John 7). Although they claim that they are Christians, John called them deceivers and antichrists. These persons went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, as today&rsquo;s modernists do, inventing something beyond the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Everyone Who Goes Beyond<br />
and Does Not Abide in This Truth<br />
Not Having God;<br />
He Who Abides in This Truth<br />
Having Both the Father and the Son</h2>
<p>Second John 9 says, &ldquo;Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word translated &ldquo;goes beyond&rdquo; means to lead forward (in a negative sense), that is, to go further than what is right, advancing beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ. This is in contrast to abiding in the teaching of Christ. The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, practiced this. They went beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ, thus denying the deity of Christ. Consequently, they could not have God in salvation and in life.</p>
<p>The teaching in verse 9 is not the teaching by Christ but the teaching concerning Christ, that is, the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception. The modernists today go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ. They also claim to be advanced in their thinking. According to them, it is out of date to say that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin through divine conception, that He died on the cross for our sins, and that He was resurrected both physically and spiritually. Denying the truth concerning the deity of Christ, the modernists claim to be advanced in their philosophical thought. In principle, they follow the way of the Cerinthian Gnostics.</p>
<p>According to verse 9, the one who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God, but he who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son. To &ldquo;have God&rdquo; is to have &ldquo;both the Father and the Son.&rdquo; Both the Father and the Son are God (Eph. 4:6; Heb. 1:8); God is triune&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit (Matt. 28:19). It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father (1 John 2:23) to be our enjoyment and reality (John 1:1, 14). In the incarnated God we have the Son in His redemption and the Father in His life. We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life. Hence, to deny the incarnation is to reject this divine enjoyment, but to abide in the truth of incarnation is to have God, as the Father and the Son, for our portion in the eternal salvation and in the divine life.</p>
<p>This point in 2 John 9 concerning having both the Father and the Son helps us to interpret the full reward spoken of in verse 8. The full reward is to have both the Father and the Son for our enjoyment. Today&rsquo;s modernists, like the ancient Gnostics, do not have the Father and the Son, for they do not abide in the teaching of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In Jude Christ is presented as our Keeper.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Being Kept by Him to Contend for the Faith<br />
Once for All Delivered to the Saints,<br />
Not Denying Our Only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 1 speaks of &ldquo;those who are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;by&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;for.&rdquo; <em>By</em> denotes the strength for and means of keeping; <em>for</em> denotes the purpose and object of keeping. All the believers have been given to the Lord by the Father (John 17:6), and they are being kept for Him and by Him. We are kept by the Christ whom we enjoy.</p>
<p>Jude 3 continues, &ldquo;Beloved, while using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you and exhort you to earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.&rdquo; Here Jude speaks of our common salvation. This is general salvation, which is common to and held by all believers, like the common faith (Titus 1:4).</p>
<p>The faith in this verse refers not to subjective faith as our believing but objective faith as our belief, referring to the things we believe in, the contents of the New Testament as our faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim. 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13), in which we believe for our common salvation. This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints. For this faith we should earnestly contend (1 Tim. 6:12).</p>
<p>In the New Testament, faith has both an objective meaning and a subjective meaning. When used in a subjective sense, faith denotes our action of believing; when used in an objective sense, faith denotes the object of our belief. In 1 Timothy 1:19 the word <em>faith</em> is used in both a subjective and objective sense. Here Paul says, &ldquo;Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith.&rdquo; The first reference to faith in this verse is subjective; it denotes our capacity to believe. The second use of faith is objective; it denotes the object of our faith. Peter tells us in his second Epistle that equally precious faith has been allotted to us (1:1). This faith is subjective and refers to the faith that is within us. This differs from the faith in Jude 3, which refers to what we believe.</p>
<p>The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God&rsquo;s will given to us in the New Testament. The law includes the contents of the Ten Commandments and all the subordinate ordinances. The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God&rsquo;s new will. This will includes even the Triune God. However, it does not include such matters as head covering, foot-washing, or methods of baptism. Nevertheless, some believers contend for such things, thinking that they are contending for the faith. But that is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. To contend for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God&rsquo;s new will.</p>
<p>The faith&mdash;our belief&mdash;is constituted of certain basic truths. First, we believe that God is one yet triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Second, we believe that our God became incarnated in the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Third, we believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God incarnated as man, lived on earth and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption. On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually, and today He is our Savior, our Lord in resurrection, and our life. Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated. Eventually, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive all His believers to Himself. These are basic truths, basic doctrines, that constitute the faith for which we should contend. Because every sound, genuine believer holds these basic truths, they are called the common faith (Titus 1:4).</p>
<p>Although Paul in Ephesians 4 makes a clear distinction between the faith and doctrine, many Christians confuse these two things. Instead of contending for the faith, they contend for their particular doctrine. Nowhere in the Scriptures are we told to fight for doctrine. However, we must contend for the faith that is related to our &ldquo;common salvation&rdquo; (Jude 3). Our common salvation comes from the common faith. Although all genuine Christians have the faith and salvation in common, we may not have all doctrines in common. The different denominations emphasize different doctrines and hold on to them. Although we are not to fight for doctrine, we must be willing to fight for the faith. In 1 Timothy 6:12 Paul charges Timothy, &ldquo;Fight the good fight of the faith.&rdquo; Therefore, we should contend for our faith, but we should not fight for our doctrine. Concerning the faith, we must be bold, strong, and definite, ready to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. However, as far as doctrines are concerned, we must be liberal with others.</p><h2 class="head4">b. As We Build Up Ourselves upon Our Most Holy Faith,Praying in the Holy Spirit, Our Keeping Ourselves<br />
in the Love of God, Awaiting the Mercy<br />
of Our Lord Jesus Christ unto Eternal Life,<br />
and Saving the Wavering Ones out of the Fire</h2>
<p>Jude 20 through 23 say, &ldquo;You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And on some have mercy, on those who are wavering; save them by snatching them out of the fire.&rdquo; Here Jude gives certain charges to the believers. In verses 20 and 21 he charges the believers to build up themselves upon the holy faith and to live in the Triune God. Then in verses 22 and 23 he charges the believers to care for others with mercy in fear.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Building Up Ourselves upon Our Most Holy Faith</h2>
<p>In verse 20 Jude says, &ldquo;You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The faith here is primarily objective faith and refers to the precious things of the New Testament in which we believe for our salvation in Christ. We build up ourselves on the foundation and in the sphere of this holy faith by praying in the Holy Spirit. The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit through our prayer are necessary for our building up. Both the faith and the Spirit are holy.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that faith in verse 20 is objective faith. However, we need to realize that this objective faith produces subjective faith. Faith first refers to the truth contained in the Word of God and conveyed by the Word. The written word of God in the Bible and the spoken word in the genuine and proper preaching and teaching contain the truth and convey the truth to us. By truth we mean the reality of what God is, the reality of the process through which God has passed, and the reality of what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained. Hence, truth as reality includes all the facts concerning what God is, what God has passed through, what God has accomplished, and what God has attained and obtained. All this is revealed in the New Testament. We may read about this in the Bible, or we may hear it through someone&rsquo;s preaching and teaching. But in either case this reality is contained in the holy Word and conveyed by the Word to us.</p>
<p>As we listen to the word that contains the truth, the Spirit of Christ works within us. The Spirit of Christ always works according to the Word and with the Word. This means that the Spirit of Christ cooperates with the Word. As a result of this cooperation, eventually in our experience the revelation of what is contained in the Word is impressed on our spirit and becomes our faith. This is the faith allotted to us as our portion from God (2 Pet. 1:1), and this portion is nothing less than the New Testament inheritance.</p>
<p>As we build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we build ourselves up in a faith that is not only objective but also subjective. The subjective faith comes out of the objective faith. In other words, faith implies both what we believe in and also our believing. This is the most holy faith.</p>
<p>This faith is not something of ourselves. In ourselves we do not have such a faith. The most holy faith is a great blessing given to us from God, of God, and even with God. When this faith comes into us, it comes with God, with all that God is, with all that God has passed through, with all that God has accomplished in Christ and through the Spirit, and with all that God has obtained and attained. All this comes into us with God in this faith. As long as we have this faith, we have the processed God, redemption, regeneration, the divine life, and all things related to life and godliness. We are also positioned and privileged to partake of the divine nature and enjoy it. Therefore, once we have this faith, we have everything. Now we need to build up ourselves upon this holy faith.</p>
<p><em>Faith</em> in Jude 20 implies the true word, for faith is produced out of the contents of the true word, God&rsquo;s revelation. The word of God&rsquo;s revelation contains the divine reality of God&rsquo;s being, process, redemptive work, accomplishment, and attainment, and this word conveys all this divine reality into us. When we hear the words concerning this reality, the Holy Spirit works within us in a way that corresponds to these words. The outcome is faith.</p>
<p>Although faith implies the true word, it implies much more than this. According to the New Testament, faith is all-inclusive. As long as we have faith, we have all the divine things. Our holy faith is both the materials with which we build and also the base or foundation on which we build. If we do not have faith, we have neither the materials with which to build nor the base, the foundation, on which to build. This means that without faith we have nothing to build on and nothing to build with. As believers, we build ourselves up with the content of our most holy faith, and we build up ourselves upon this faith as a foundation. Therefore, with these divine things as the material and foundation, we may build up ourselves upon our most holy faith.</p>
<p>To build up ourselves upon the faith does not mean to build ourselves up with theological doctrines or biblical knowledge. Mere doctrine or knowledge is too objective and also empty. But truth as the reality of the holy Word is not empty. This truth is the content of the most holy faith. Therefore, with this content we have something real and solid with which and on which to build.</p>
<p>The building up in the most holy faith is not individualistic; rather, this building is a corporate matter. Jude is speaking to the believers corporately when he charges them to build up themselves in their most holy faith. If we would build up ourselves in the faith, we must do it in a corporate way; that is, we must do it in the Body, in the church life. Apart from the church life, we cannot build up ourselves upon the faith. Outside the church life, there is not such a building. Actually, to build up ourselves upon the most holy faith is to build up the Body of Christ. In fact, Jude&rsquo;s word concerning building up ourselves upon our most holy faith is equal to Peter&rsquo;s word about being built up as a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5).</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Praying in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>According to Jude 20, if we would build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit. Faith is related to the Word, and in the Holy Spirit we have life. In this verse the Holy Spirit refers mainly to life, not power. However, some Christians today understand the Holy Spirit mainly in terms of power. In Romans 8:2 Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life. From experience we know that praying in the Holy Spirit is much more a matter of life than a matter of power. When we pray, we may not sense power; however, we often have the sense of life. Life is more precious than power. Actually, real spiritual power comes from spiritual life.</p>
<p>Genuine power is a matter of life. We may use seeds as an illustration. Seeds of every kind are small. Yet although a seed is small, it is dynamic and full of life. Because a seed is full of life, it is powerful. After a seed is sown in the ground, it sprouts and grows into a plant or tree. Although the sprouts may be very tender, they have the power to break through the soil. This power comes from the life in the seed. In a similar way, building ourselves up by praying in the Holy Spirit is mainly a matter of life.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in Jude is the Spirit for our prayer. We need to pray not in ourselves but in Him. Today this praying Spirit is abiding in our spirit; thus, we must live in spirit. Jude 19 says, &ldquo;These are those who make divisions, soulish, having no spirit.&rdquo; What should distinguish the believers from the unbelievers is that the latter are soulish, not using their spirit, while the former care for their spirit and pray in the Holy Spirit. We may illustrate the difference between believers and unbelievers in the following ways. When an unbeliever is going to travel, he exercises his mind to decide on the means of transportation. This means that he is soulish. However, when a believer is going to travel, he should make his decisions by exercising his spirit to pray. Similarly, the unbelievers exercise their mind and live in the soul to make decisions about their schooling. The believers, however, behave in a different way. Because they have the Holy Spirit within them, they make all their decisions by exercising their spirit to pray in Him. It is regrettable, though, that we sometimes behave the same as the unbelievers do. It seems that we do not have a spirit, that we are soulish. In everything, we need to pray in the Spirit. Unbelievers do not have the Holy Spirit in their spirit, but we the believers do.</p>
<p>Prayer should be in the Holy Spirit. Prayer, which is a matter of man cooperating with God, must possess two natures. Prayers that come only from man and thus are not mingled with God are merely religious prayers. They do not touch God, breathe in God, or reach God. This is the reason that Jude says we should pray in the Holy Spirit. Praying in the Holy Spirit means that we and the Holy Spirit must pray together.</p>
<p>The secret to the Christian life is to be mingled with the Holy Spirit. The spiritual life of a Christian is absolutely a matter of man being mingled with the Holy Spirit. When we are in the Holy Spirit, we live a genuine spiritual life. When we are not in the Holy Spirit, we do not live a genuine spiritual life. It is possible for us to have all kinds of religious activities, but if we are not in the Holy Spirit, there is no way for us to have a genuine spiritual life. This particularly applies to prayer. Apart from the Holy Spirit we have only religious prayers, which have no spiritual worth before God. If we want genuine, spiritual prayers, prayers that reach God, touch God, breathe in God, and are in God, we must pray in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Keeping Ourselves in the Love of God</h2>
<p>In verse 21 Jude says, &ldquo;Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.&rdquo; We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves in the holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit. In this way we should await and look for the mercy of our Lord so that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but also inherit it for eternity (Matt. 19:29).</p>
<p>If we do not build up ourselves in the faith and pray in the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for us to depart from the love of God. Actually, the words <em>in the love of God</em> mean in the enjoyment of the love of God. Here Jude speaks of the love of God not in an objective way but in a subjective way, in the way of enjoying this love. Hour after hour we need to enjoy the love of God. We should be in the love of God not only objectively but also subjectively. We need to keep ourselves always in the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s love by building ourselves up and by praying. Building up ourselves is related to the holy Word, and praying is related to the Holy Spirit. Therefore, if we have the Word applied to us and the Spirit working within us, we will be kept in the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s love as we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p><h2 class="head5">(4) Awaiting the Mercy of Our Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Jude 21 speaks of &ldquo;awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; It is significant that Jude speaks of mercy and not of grace. Peter emphasizes grace, but Jude emphasizes mercy. In verse 2 of this Epistle Jude says, &ldquo;Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.&rdquo; Mercy reaches further than grace does. Mercy is for persons who are in a miserable and pitiful situation and condition. When the prodigal son came to his father in Luke 15, he was altogether in a miserable and pitiful condition. Whatever the Father did for this pitiful, prodigal son was a mercy to him. While we are praying in the Spirit and keeping ourselves in the love of God, we should await further mercy from the Lord. The word <em>awaiting</em> implies trusting. While we await and look for the mercy of our Lord, we are also trusting in His mercy.</p>
<p>Jude 20 and 21 charge the believers not only to build themselves up in the holy faith but also to live in the Triune God. The entire blessed Trinity is employed and enjoyed by the believers in their praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping themselves in the love of God, and awaiting the mercy of our Lord unto eternal life. In these verses we have the Spirit, God the Father, and the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. We need to pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God, and await the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, in these verses we definitely have the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the Christian life the believers possess the Divine Trinity and should live in and with the Divine Trinity. The Father is in the believers (Eph. 4:6), the Son lives in the believers (Gal. 2:20), and the Spirit abides in the believers (John 14:17). In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [the Son], and the love of God [the Father], and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Then Jude tells us that we should be those who, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God [the Father], awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ [the Son] (vv. 20-21).</p>
<p>The revelation of the Divine Trinity in 2 Corinthians 13:14 and Jude 20 and 21 match each other. In both portions there is the love of God (the Father). The mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Son) in Jude matches the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Son) in 2 Corinthians. In the Lord Jesus there is grace, and when grace is extended to us and reaches us, it is mercy. Finally, praying in the Holy Spirit in Jude matches the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in 2 Corinthians. Praying is a kind of fellowship.</p>
<p>To enjoy the Divine Trinity, we need to pray. To pray is to enter into the current of the Divine Trinity, to enter into the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Through this fellowship, we reach the source of the love of God. Then in the love of God, we await and look for the mercy of our Lord, that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but also inherit it for eternity (Matt. 19:29). In the opening of his Epistle, Jude mentions mercy (v. 2). Mercy is mentioned instead of grace due to the church&rsquo;s degradation and apostasy. In the degraded situation of the churches, God&rsquo;s mercy is needed. When the churches are in degradation, what they need is the Lord&rsquo;s far-reaching mercy. We all need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. This mercy is a bridge to the grace of Christ. We need to pray in the Holy Spirit that we may touch the source, the love of God, in which we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the enjoyment of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) Unto Eternal Life</h2>
<p>Jude concludes verse 21 with the words <em>unto eternal life.</em> Here the word <em>unto</em> means issuing in or resulting in. The enjoyment and inheritance of eternal life, the life of God, is the goal of our spiritual seeking. Because we aim at this goal, we desire to be kept in the love of God and await the mercy of our Lord.</p>
<p>Jude is not saying that we do not yet have eternal life. Neither is he saying that if we keep praying in the Holy Spirit and remain in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of the Lord, then we will eventually have eternal life. Rather, Jude is saying that praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping ourselves in the love of the Father, and waiting for the mercy of the Lord issue in the present enjoyment of eternal life. We already have eternal life in us. However, unless we pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of the Father, and wait for the mercy of the Lord, we will not enjoy this eternal life. But when we do all these things, the eternal life within us becomes our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Although we have eternal life, our measure of this life may be somewhat limited. But if we pray in the Spirit, keep ourselves in the Father&rsquo;s love, and wait for the Son&rsquo;s mercy, the eternal life in us will grow in measure. Therefore, <em>unto eternal life</em> means not only unto the enjoyment of eternal life but also unto the growth, the increase of the measure, of eternal life. To experience this is to live in the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(6) Saving the Wavering Ones out of the Fire</h2>
<p>In verses 22 and 23 Jude continues, &ldquo;On some have mercy, on those who are wavering; save them by snatching them out of the fire.&rdquo; Jude&rsquo;s word concerning snatching the wavering ones out of the fire is a metaphor probably adopted from Zechariah 3:2. The fire here is the fire of God&rsquo;s holiness for His judgment (Matt. 3:10, 12; 5:22). According to this word, we should seek to save others and snatch them out of the fire.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. God Being Able to Guard Us from Stumbling<br />
and to Set Us before His Glory without Blemish<br />
in Exultation through Him</h2>
<p>Jude 24 says, &ldquo;To Him who is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation.&rdquo; Verse 24 is one of the precious and exceedingly great promises (2 Pet. 1:4). God is able to guard us from stumbling and to set us before His glory without blemish in exultation through the Christ whom we enjoy.</p>
<p>Jude indicates clearly that although he has charged the believers to endeavor in the things mentioned in verses 20 through 23, nevertheless only God our Savior is able to guard them from stumbling and to set them before His glory without blemish in exultation. Glory here is the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus, which will be manifested at His appearing (Titus 2:13; 1 Pet. 4:13) and in which He will come (Luke 9:26). The preposition <em>in</em> here means in the element of, and the word <em>exultation</em> signifies the exuberance of triumphant joy (Alford).</p>
<p>Jude 25 concludes, &ldquo;To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time and now and unto all eternity. Amen.&rdquo; The only God is our Savior, and the man Jesus Christ is our Lord. To such a Savior, through such a Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority throughout all ages. Glory is the expression in splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling. In Jude&rsquo;s words this is &ldquo;before all time and now and unto all eternity.&rdquo; <em>Before all time</em> refers to eternity past; <em>now,</em> to the present age; and <em>unto all eternity,</em> to eternity future. Therefore, it is from eternity past, through time, unto eternity future.</p>
<p>In Jude there is the matter of building up ourselves upon the most holy faith (v. 20). Here the faith is the impartation of Christ into us. To be built up in this faith is to be built up in the dispensing of the divine life. Then we can pray in the Holy Spirit and keep ourselves in the love of God as we await the mercy of our Lord (vv. 20b-21). In the holy faith we have the Trinity for our enjoyment. This enjoyment of the Trinity is for us to partake of the dispensing of the divine life. Eventually this is unto eternal life and will set us before His glory without blemish in exultation (v. 24). This indicates clearly that to experience the Trinity is to enjoy the dispensing of life, which is unto eternal life and the divine glory. We need to pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God, and wait for the mercy of Jesus Christ so that we may have the enjoyment and increase of eternal life forever and be set before God&rsquo;s glory.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(105)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">B. Expressing Him:</h2>
<p>In this message we will see that we may express Christ by putting Him on (Rom. 13:14) and by triumphing in Him in our ministry (2 Cor. 2:14-16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. By Putting Him On</h2>
<p>Romans 13:14 says, &ldquo;Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.&rdquo; This verse indicates that we need to take Christ as our new garment and put Him on so that we may express Him.</p>
<p>In verse 12 we are told to &ldquo;put on the weapons of light,&rdquo; and in verse 14, to &ldquo;put on the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; By placing these two phrases together, we can see that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is the weapons of light. Furthermore, the phrase <em>make no provision for the flesh</em> corresponds to 8:12, where Paul says, &ldquo;We are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.&rdquo; The warfare in 13:14 is between the lusts and the Spirit, as in Galatians 5:17. We must put on Christ, who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), in order to fight the battle against our lusts. Here the warfare does not concern the devil or the forces of evil in the heavenlies as in Ephesians 6:12; it concerns the lusts against which we must fight by putting on the Lord Jesus Christ as our weapons of light. This kind of warfare is different from that in Romans 7:23, where it is the law of sin in our flesh warring against the good law in our mind; this warfare has nothing to do with the Spirit. But 13:14 shows that by putting on Christ, we fight against the fleshy works of darkness.</p>
<p>We have been baptized into Christ and are already in Christ (6:3; Gal. 3:27). Why then must we still put on Christ? To put on Christ actually means to live by Christ (2:20) and to live out Christ (Phil. 1:21). Although we are in Christ, we need to live by Christ and to live out Christ practically. We need to have a daily living that is by Christ and that expresses Christ. We need to put on the Lord Jesus Christ as our second garment (Psa. 45:13-14) to live Him as our subjective righteousness and magnify Him.</p>
<p>The expression of Christ in our daily life is our weapon for fighting against the flesh. Since the battle in Romans 13:14 is not against the devil or spiritual wickedness but against the flesh with all of its lusts, we need to live by Christ. The more we live by Christ, the more He becomes our weapons against the lusts of the flesh.</p>
<p>By wearing Him as our garment, we make no provision for the flesh; that is, we have no intention to provide anything for our lustful flesh. The Greek word translated &ldquo;provision&rdquo; in verse 14 means &ldquo;arrangement.&rdquo; This word has the same root as the Greek word for &ldquo;take forethought&rdquo; in 12:17. <em>To take forethought</em> includes the meaning &ldquo;to provide.&rdquo; To make no provision for the flesh is to not take any forethought for the flesh or provide the flesh with anything that will support it and make it convenient for it to fulfill its lusts.</p>
<p>We should not supply the flesh with anything. This indicates that the flesh continues to exist. Regardless of how spiritual we become, the flesh can still be revived. The flesh is hungry and desires food, but we must starve it to death, making no provision that will allow it to fulfill its lusts. The present human society is dark and evil, containing numerous provisions for the flesh. The enemy has used them to provide food for the hungry flesh. We need to keep away from them. When we wear Christ as our expression, we give no ground to our flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. By Triumphing in Him in Our Ministry</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 2:14-16 reveals that we may express Christ by triumphing in Him in our ministry. In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.&rdquo; Concerning this verse, Conybeare says, &ldquo;The verb here used...means <em>to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession;</em> the full phrase means <em>to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ</em>....God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul (who had been so great an opponent of the gospel) is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet (at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor) an incense-bearer, scattering incense (which was always done on these occasions) as the procession moves on. Some of the conquered enemies were put to death when the procession reached the Capitol; to them the smell of the incense was &lsquo;an odor of death unto death&rsquo;; to the rest who were spared, &lsquo;an odor of life unto life.&rsquo;&rdquo; The same metaphor is used in Colossians 2:15. God always leads the apostles in such a triumphant way for their ministry.</p>
<p>The word <em>us</em> in 2 Corinthians 2:14 refers to the conquered captives in the train of Christ&rsquo;s triumph, celebrating and participating in Christ&rsquo;s triumph. Here the apostle spoke about his and his co-workers&rsquo; ministry. He likened their ministry to a celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory. Their move in their ministry for Christ was like a triumphal procession going from one place to another under God&rsquo;s leading. He and his co-workers were Christ&rsquo;s captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ, for His triumphant glory. They had been conquered by Christ and had become His captives in the train of His triumph, scattering the fragrance of Christ from place to place. The apostles&rsquo; move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him is God&rsquo;s celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory over His enemies.</p>
<p>In verse 14 Paul indicates that he was a captive of Christ. He fought against Christ, the heavenly General, but eventually he was defeated, subdued, and captured, and thereby became a captive of Christ. Saul of Tarsus was a strong, ambitious young man who fought against Christ, against God&rsquo;s economy, and against the churches. But while he was fighting, he was defeated and subdued by Christ on the way to Damascus. At that time, the Lord Jesus told him not to kick against the goads, that is, not to fight against Him (Acts 26:14). A goad on a plow is a sharp-pointed stick used to subdue and prod an ox yoked to the plow. While Saul was kicking against the goads, the Lord was laughing at him in the heavens (Psa. 2:4). After Saul of Tarsus was captured, he was placed in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession. The first three captives in this procession were Peter, John, and James. As one of the captives in a train of defeated foes, Paul was being led in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession. God led him from city to city as a captive to celebrate the victory of Christ. Saul was a rebel against Christ, but he became an apostle by being captured by Christ. He went from city to city to preach Christ as one in the train of vanquished foes.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have been freed by Christ; we are released people, who now have our freedom and liberty. On the other hand, however, we have been captured by Christ. Every person freed by Christ is a captive of Christ under His power and authority. For Christ to be transfused into us, we must be captives. Today people treasure their liberty, freedom, and human rights, and no one wants to be considered a captive. We, however, are the captives of Christ.</p>
<p>The ministers of the new covenant were captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory (2 Cor. 2:14a). The proper ministry of the New Testament is a triumphal procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory. The ministry of the New Testament is to testify of Christ as the Winner and the Victor. As Paul was marching in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession, he could praise the Lord for His victory and in this way testify of Him. The apostles&rsquo; move in the ministry was like a triumphal celebration from one place to another under God&rsquo;s leading. Wherever that procession moved, they celebrated the victory of Christ and witnessed of Christ&rsquo;s triumph over them. Likewise, as captives of Christ, we also witness of Him today. We were defeated by Him, captured by Him, and subdued by Him, becoming submissive captives who say Amen to His victory and praise Him. Gospel preachers must consider themselves as captives in the procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory. Whenever they preach the gospel, they should go as captives in a procession.</p>
<p>Jesus defeated us, conquered us, subdued us, and captured us. Therefore, now we are dependent upon Him. We take Him as our everything. This is the procession of His triumph. We may not realize that we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and gained by Christ, the Victor, and that now we are captives in the train of His victorious procession. However, if we have an inward realization concerning this matter, it will make us a different kind of person. We will always be conscious of the fact that we have been captured by Christ, subdued by Him, and gained by Him. In relation to ourselves, therefore, we are nothing. A captive is one who is now absolutely for the one who has conquered him. He knows that now he is among those marching in the train of the victorious procession of the one who has captured him.</p>
<p>If we are conscious of the fact that we are a captive in the train of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession, then we would not be able to exchange words with others. How could a captive in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession exchange words? As a captive of Christ, we have nothing to say and nothing to do. We all need to realize in a practical way that we are captives in Christ&rsquo;s procession. Such a realization will certainly change us.</p>
<p>On the one hand, through His death and resurrection Christ has vanquished and captured us. On the other hand, in our experience Christ must conquer us, subdue us, and capture us. In 2 Corinthians 2:14 we are told that God &ldquo;always leads us in triumph.&rdquo; Here the triumph is not our triumph but Christ&rsquo;s triumph. God always leads us as captives in the triumph of Christ. Truthfully speaking, many of us must admit that instead of our being captives to Christ, Christ is a captive to us. In our experience who is the captive? Who is celebrating the victory? Who is defeated? Many of us need to admit that much of the time, Christ our Savior has been defeated and captured by us, becoming our captive in the train of the celebration of our fleshly victory. In many things we are not subdued or conquered by Christ. It may be that our will, the human will, the self-will, has never been conquered. On the one hand, we believers are slaves to Christ; on the other hand, we may be still opponents, enemies, to Christ because our will has not been subdued or conquered. We should also consider whether or not our desire has been conquered by Christ. Even in seeking spiritual things, we may still be an enemy of Christ. While we are seeking spiritual things, we may still be opponents to Christ because we seek spiritual things in our way according to ourselves, according to our desire. We may be seeking the Lord according to our will. We all must realize that we first need to be conquered and defeated, praying from the depths of our being, &ldquo;Lord, defeat me. Be merciful to me and never let me have the victory. O Lord, how dangerous and how pitiful it would be if You would allow me to have the victory. Lord, keep me defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day by day there are many struggles, not between us and the world, or us and sins, but between us and the Lord. We should not focus on the world or sins but take care of the battle between us and the Lord. If we would only be willing to be defeated by the Lord, all the world and sins would be under our feet. We are defeated by the world or besetting sins because we are defeating Christ in our daily living. We need to concentrate our prayer on being conquered by Him: &ldquo;Lord, make me Your captive. Never let me win. Defeat me all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many things of the self, including selfish will, selfish desire, and selfish thoughts, may be within us. Consequently, day by day Christ has been defeated by us. We may not know how many rebellious elements are within us. Hence, we have to be defeated, conquered, subdued, and eventually carried away as a captive in the triumphal procession of Christ&rsquo;s victory. We need to tell ourselves and tell the Lord that we are willing to be a captive of Christ.</p>
<p>If only a small number of people would be willing to be captives of Christ in His triumphal procession, the entire earth would be greatly affected. Many seek for gifts of power, but what the church and the world need is not gifted persons but captured persons. Today what the church needs is not spiritual giants but little captives. In this universe and on this earth God is celebrating the triumph of His Son, Christ. Are you willing to be just a little captive in this celebration? If you are willing, then wherever you go, person after person will be captured. Just as you are a captive, they also will become captives of Christ. We may consider the apostle Paul as a great preacher, but he considered himself as a captive. God leads us as captives in the triumph of Christ, celebrating His victory. We all must be willing to be Christ&rsquo;s captives. We all need to bow our knees and say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to be Your captive.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head4">a. Manifesting the Savor of the Knowledge of Him</h2>
<p>In verse 14 Paul also likens himself and his co-workers to incense-bearers scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession. The apostles are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph. Concerning the phrase <em>the savor of the knowledge,</em> Vincent says, &ldquo;According to the Greek usage, <em>savor</em> and <em>knowledge</em> are in apposition, so that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; The apostles&rsquo; excellent knowledge of Christ became a sweet savor. On the one hand, the apostles were captives; on the other hand, they were those bearing incense, the fragrance of Christ. As the apostles marched in Christ&rsquo;s procession, they bore the fragrance of Christ as incense. The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ to God. They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God.</p>
<p>The more a person is exposed to the fragrance of incense, the more this fragrance will permeate him. If the fragrance of incense is imparted to him, wherever he goes, he will carry with him the fragrance of the incense. Hence, the scattering of the incense of Christ is actually a matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>The transcendent power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in us enables us to endure the sufferings that others cannot bear and to live a life that others cannot live, thereby manifesting the fragrance of Christ. Through the power of His resurrection Christ leads us in joyful triumph in His victory procession and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us. If in our daily living we enjoy Christ, depend on Christ, fellowship with Christ, and are filled with Christ, then we can say that for us to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21a). People will sense a special flavor in us&mdash;the fragrance of Christ. This is not being a moralist or a virtuous man; this is Christ as our life living Himself out from us, leading us in triumph, and manifesting His fragrance.</p>
<p>One aspect of our living Christ is our spiritual service, which is an outward action that issues from touching the inward feeling of Christ. This action is Christ&rsquo;s coming out of us. Because the Spirit is the realization of Christ, when the Spirit touches us, it is Christ who is touching us, and when the Spirit motivates us, it is Christ who is motivating us. Then anyone who contacts us will sense the fragrance of Christ in us. We will be able to give people a flavor that is spiritual and heavenly. When we listen to someone&rsquo;s preaching, we may not sense the flavor of Christ in him. This is because in his living he is disconnected from Christ, and there is a barrier between him and Christ. He has not yet dealt with certain matters before God, and his spirit has lost contact with Christ. We sense his eloquence, but we cannot sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence with him, and neither can we touch spiritual reality. Whatever we do in our service should have Christ and even be Christ.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:8 Paul says that he counted everything as refuse for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 2:14 he speaks of the savor of the knowledge of Christ. The excellent knowledge of Christ is a fragrance, an aroma. This means that we who have been conquered and captured and brought into the triumphal procession to celebrate Christ&rsquo;s victory speak to others the excellent knowledge of Christ. Whatever we speak, that is the excellent knowledge of Christ. We know Christ by our experience and enjoyment of Him. As we march in the triumphal procession, we speak to others about the Christ whom we know. What we say concerning Him is a sweet-smelling savor.</p>
<p>In his preaching of the gospel, Paul was spreading abroad the fragrance of Christ. Likewise, whenever we speak Christ, this speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ. Paul also says that this is a sweet fragrance to God. This means that when we speak Christ to others, in our speaking the fragrance of Christ ascends to God for His enjoyment. Whenever we speak Christ to others, we need to realize that our speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ. While we are speaking, God is enjoying this fragrance. When we speak forth the riches of Christ in the meetings, we are spreading Christ as a sweet fragrance. God enjoys this fragrance in our speaking forth Christ.</p>
<p>We need to speak Christ with our spiritual knowledge. The apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ. Because they were permeated in this way, they became the fragrance of Christ to God. When they spoke to others, the Christ with whom they were constituted spread Himself out from their being and came forth as a sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment. We may say that they were permeated with Christ as the divine perfume. Wherever they went, God could manifest through them a sweet fragrance of Christ.</p>
<p>This should also be our experience today. While we are speaking Christ, He should come forth as a sweet fragrance out of our being. This is a matter of the divine dispensing. Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we can mature in life and triumph in our ministry. We all can have a triumphant ministry. When we open our mouths to speak for Christ, we will be triumphant. We can allow Christ to spread His sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment. All this takes place by God&rsquo;s dispensing, by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.</p>
<p>According to 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, God firmly attaches us unto Christ, has anointed us, sealed us, and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge. Based upon this, God manifests the fragrance of Christ through us for others&rsquo; salvation (2:14-15). The saving power is the fragrance of Christ going out from us. This fragrance is actually the living Spirit. When unbelievers breathe in this fragrance, they receive Christ. When we go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, they should be able to breathe in the fragrance of Christ.</p>
<p>The real gospel preaching is the scattering of the incense. Jesus is the incense scattered among His captives. If we do not learn to enjoy the indwelling Christ, there is no incense in the church life. When we learn to enjoy Him as the One indwelling us, we scatter the sweet savor to others. This sweet smell is something of the sweet nature and essence of Jesus Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. As a Fragrance of Him to God<br />
in Those Who Are Being Saved,<br />
a Savor out of Life unto Life, and<br />
in Those Who Are Perishing,<br />
a Savor out of Death unto Death</h2>
<p>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.&rdquo; The manifestation of the savor of the knowledge of Christ has a twofold effect, a twofold result: either it results in life unto life, or it results in death unto death (v. 16). To some, to those who are God&rsquo;s chosen ones, this fragrance will be life; however, to others this fragrance will be death. This refers to the different effects of the apostles&rsquo; ministry upon different persons. It is a matter of life and death! This is the triumph and effect of the ministry, which is the constitution of Christ within us.</p>
<p>If we manifest the savor of the knowledge of Christ, wherever we are, we will bring either life or death. Wherever we go, people will either receive life or suffer death. Either they will go to Christ or will be devoured by Satan. No matter who a person may be, if he contacts us, it will be either life or death to him. This is a very significant matter.</p>
<p>Christ as the General won the victory over all His enemies and has had a triumphal procession to celebrate His great victory. In this procession we are the captives of Christ by His victory and ones who manifest the savor of the knowledge of Him. As we triumph in Christ in our ministry, God manifests the savor of the knowledge of Christ as a fragrance to God&mdash;in those who are being saved a savor out of life unto life and in those who are perishing a savor out of death unto death. This is our expressing Christ as His fragrance.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">3. As a Letter of His</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:3 says, &ldquo;Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.&rdquo; This verse reveals that we may express Christ as His letter. Here a letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet. A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ. All believers of Christ should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in their being.</p>
<p>A letter of Christ is composed using Christ as the words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. From beginning to end, Christ is every part of such a letter. Therefore, a letter of Christ speaks Christ, for every part of the letter expresses Him. In order to make us the living letters of Christ, He needs to be written, wrought, into us. People should be able to read Christ on our being. We may preach about Christ, but how much of Christ can people read on us? When people observe the way that we live, they should read Christ. We need more of Christ written upon us; that is, we need more of Christ wrought into us. Christ should be wrought into our thinking, our loving, our choosing, and into our entire being. The extent to which Christ can be seen or read by others in us depends upon the extent to which Christ has been written into us. This is a matter not of doctrine but of experience.</p>
<p>When a man is regenerated by the Holy Spirit and his spirit is made alive, he becomes a living epistle of Christ. This living epistle is written with the Spirit of the living God. This means that God writes Christ into the believers by the Spirit, imprinting Christ into them.</p>
<p>By having Christ inscribed into us, we also become living letters of Christ, which can be read by others. There are many cases of young people who have been read by their parents. At first, their parents opposed them because they had turned to the Lord or had come into the church life. But even while the parents were opposing them, they were reading what had been inscribed of Christ into them. As a result, after a period of time many of these opposing parents turned to the Lord&rsquo;s way. Even if your parents are opposing you, they are still watching you, reading you as a letter of Christ. Eventually, if you live and walk in the Spirit of life in your relationship with your parents, they will be convinced. Although you may not intentionally try to honor your parents, spontaneously you render them the most excellent and wonderful respect because you walk according to the spirit. Your parents will notice this, appreciate it, and eventually may be convinced and subdued by it.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Ministered by the Apostles</h2>
<p>In verse 3 Paul says that the Corinthian believers were a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles. This means that through their ministry the apostles &ldquo;wrote&rdquo; such a letter of Christ. In this verse the word <em>ministered</em> actually means &ldquo;served.&rdquo; Thus, Paul is saying that the Corinthian believers are a letter of Christ served by the apostles. However, realizing that the word <em>serve</em> is not adequate, Paul went on to use the word <em>inscribed</em>. This explains the meaning of ministered, or served. Paul&rsquo;s way of ministering was by inscribing. Paul and his co-workers were writing living epistles. These epistles were their letters of commendation. The apostles were the writers, and the believers were the epistles written by them.</p>
<p>As one who was a pattern for living Christ for the church, Paul was competent in Christ to write these living letters with Christ Himself as the spiritual alphabet. He was qualified, and he had a mastery of the skill necessary for this. The book of Revelation says clearly that Christ is the Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and the Omega, the last letter (22:13). Surely Christ is also all the letters between alpha and omega. Anyone who lives Christ for the church knows Christ as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and every other letter of the heavenly alphabet. We all should look to the Lord for His mercy and grace in order to carry on the work of writing Christ into the saints. Instead of merely teaching doctrines or the Bible to others, we must do the unique work of writing living letters of Christ.</p>
<p>The letters of Christ are written by the ministry of the apostles. The apostles are filled with Christ so that their ministry spontaneously ministers Christ to those whom they contact, inscribing Christ in their heart and making them living letters conveying Christ. As apostles, Paul and his co-workers were themselves letters of Christ, epistles written with Christ as the content (2 Cor. 3:1-3). Paul was a living letter written of Christ by the Holy Spirit with all the realities of Christ as the writing element. Today when we read 2 Corinthians, which is Paul&rsquo;s autobiography, we can see Christ. We can read Christ in him. What is written in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles is nothing but Christ. Christ is conveyed to the readers in every book that he wrote. Paul is always associated with Christ because Paul is Christ&rsquo;s letter. When we read him, we see Christ. It is difficult not to refer to Paul when we speak about Christ. The fourteen Epistles of Paul constitute half of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Without these fourteen Epistles, the New Testament would not be complete (Col. 1:25).</p>
<p>When the Corinthians were sinners, not knowing Christ, Paul came to them and brought them to Christ. He begot them in Christ through the gospel and became their spiritual father (1 Cor. 4:15). In a sense, Paul begot us also. In Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles we see Christ to a much greater extent than what is portrayed in the four Gospels. We see the all-inclusive, mysterious Christ, who is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and who produces the mystery of Christ, the church (Eph. 3:4). The most striking point of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles is that in them he opens up the eternal and universal mystery. God has a mystery, which He planned in eternity past, but the four Gospels do not speak much concerning God&rsquo;s eternal plan as the mystery of the universe. Paul, however, unveils to us the mystery of the all-inclusive Christ as the Head for the producing of the Body.</p>
<p>Paul was constituted with Christ and was a living letter of Christ. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles do not convey mainly himself but the Christ with whom he was constituted to such an extent that he could say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). Paul lived and did many things, yet it was no longer he but Christ. When we read Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, we are reading him, yet what we see is not Paul himself but Christ as his constituent. Like Paul, we should be constituted with Christ. In a sense, the name of Christ should be a part of our name, because when people read us, they see Christ. It is no longer we but Christ who lives in us. Just as Paul says, for to us, to live is not we ourselves but Christ (Phil. 1:21). Christ is our person and the reality of our person; in this sense, we are Christ.</p>
<p>Paul was one who wrote living letters of Christ. Now we also must follow him to inscribe Christ into others and thereby to compose living letters of Christ. Wherever we go, we should write Christ into others. What people need is to have Christ inscribed into them. We all should go forth to write living letters with the life-giving Spirit of the living God.</p>
<p>Some of the saints may think that because they are not apostles, they cannot participate in writing a living letter of Christ. We should not hold this concept. Through our preaching of the gospel, we can write Christ into others. To preach the gospel is to write a living letter.</p>
<p>The proper preaching of the gospel depends on our measure of life and on our experience of God and Christ. A brother with considerable experience of God and Christ may speak to a fellow worker concerning God. Instead of trying to convince him of the existence of God, the brother may testify of how he came to believe in God and receive Christ as his Savior. He may testify that something living and real came into him and changed him. Such a testimony infuses others with Christ, convinces them, and subdues them. This is the experiential way to preach the gospel. This way is a matter of infusing into others what we have enjoyed of God and Christ. Even though unbelievers may not mentally accept what we tell them, through our experiential preaching of the gospel the element of God and of Christ will be infused into them.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Inscribed Not with Ink<br />
but with the Spirit of the Living God</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul says, &ldquo;Inscribed not <em>with</em> ink&rdquo;; he does not say, &ldquo;Inscribed not <em>by</em> ink.&rdquo; It is important that we pay careful attention to Paul&rsquo;s use of the preposition <em>with.</em> The word <em>with</em> indicates that the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence, an element, used by the one doing the inscribing or the writing. This preposition indicates that the Spirit is neither the writer nor the instrument used for writing; rather, the Spirit is the essence, the element, the substance, used in writing. The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, such as a pen, but an element, the heavenly ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.</p>
<p>The ministry of the apostles is to write letters with the life-giving Spirit as the essence. The more the apostles minister to us, the more they impart into us the element of the life-giving Spirit, just as the more we write on the paper, the more ink is added to the paper. In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul does not view the Spirit as a person, an instrument, or a power. Rather, the Spirit is the essence used for inscribing living letters of Christ.</p>
<p>Our ministry in the local churches must be a ministry of inscribing. It should not be mere teaching. If we only teach others, the divine essence will not be inscribed into them. Teaching does not require any essence; however, inscribing does require an essence, just as writing with a pen requires ink. Likewise, we must have the divine essence in order to inscribe it into the being of the saints. On the one hand, the Spirit as the processed Triune God is the essence inscribed into our being. Because this essence has been inscribed into us, we cannot remain the same. Transformation is taking place within us. On the other hand, through our ministry of the word, we should inscribe the divine essence into others so that, although they may not remember the points of the message, what has been inscribed into them of the divine essence will never be erased.</p>
<p>The ministry of inscribing is unique, and the essence used for inscribing is also unique. Peter did not do one kind of inscribing with one kind of essence, and Paul, a different kind of inscribing with a different kind of essence. No, the apostles were not divided; neither were they divisive. Rather, they all practiced the same inscribing with the same essence. Therefore, the unique inscribing must be with the unique essence, the Triune God as the Spirit. The term <em>the Spirit,</em> as used in the New Testament, is very meaningful. The Spirit denotes the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>In Genesis 1:2 we read of the Spirit of God. Elsewhere the Old Testament speaks of the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 10:6). In the New Testament the term <em>the Holy Spirit</em> is used (Luke 1:35; 3:22). Then in Acts 16:7 we read of the Spirit of Jesus; in Romans 8:9, of the Spirit of Christ; and in Philippians 1:19, of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. In Romans 8 we are charged to walk according to the spirit (v. 4). In the New Testament the emphasis is not on walking in the Holy Spirit or in the Spirit of God; the emphasis is on walking according to the spirit. Finally, at the end of the Bible in Revelation 22:17, we read of the Spirit and the bride. Thus, the Bible ends with a word not about the Spirit of God, nor about the Holy Spirit, but about the Spirit. The Spirit in Revelation 22:17 is the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>We should not regard the Spirit as being separate from God. In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; In the same verse Paul also speaks of &ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord.&rdquo; The Spirit is the Lord, and the Lord is the Spirit. In like manner, the Spirit of the living God is actually the living God Himself. When Paul says that the apostles inscribed a letter with the Spirit of the living God, this does not mean that the Spirit of the living God is only the Spirit and not God Himself. The Spirit of the living God is God. The living God is the Triune God, the One who has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and has now been consummated in the life-giving, life-imparting, and life-dispensing Spirit. With this Spirit the apostles inscribed upon the saints to make them a letter of Christ written by them.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the writing Spirit, and we are the letters of Christ. The Spirit is the ink for writing Christ into us. As the divine ink, the Spirit is the Spirit of the living God. There should be something living within us all the time as evidence that Christ is being written into every part of our inner being. If we are under the Spirit&rsquo;s writing, we have the deep sense of being living within. Christ is being written into us with the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God. This makes us a letter of Christ. We are under the writing of the Spirit of the living God, and He is engraving Christ into us.</p>
<p>If we are persons full of Christ, saturated with the life-giving Spirit, we will have the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) with which to write Christ into others. We will also have the life-giving Spirit of the living God as the heavenly ink. The ink is the Spirit, the essence of the ink is Christ with all His riches, and we are the pen. To have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ. Others should always find us in Christ. In Philippians 3:9 Paul speaks of being found in Christ. He wanted to be found by others in Christ, not in anything other than Christ. Paul did not want to be found in himself, in his culture, or in his particular way of living. We also should aspire to be found in Christ, to be one with Christ, saturated with Christ, constituted of Christ, and reorganized with Him. Then, being anointed with the Spirit and filled with the life-giving Spirit, we will have the Spirit as the ink to write Christ into others. Then as we speak to others, we will spontaneously write upon them with the life-giving Spirit of the living God. The element of the riches of Christ will be infused into them, imparted into their being. In this way, Christ will be inscribed into them. To write Christ into others in this way is truly to live Christ for the church.</p>
<p>The more we speak for the Lord, the more Christ is written into us. It is in this way that we become ministers of the word. The ministry comes out of the inward writing of Christ with the Spirit as the writing ink. This writing Spirit is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the ink, and the content of the ink is Christ with His person, work, and attainments. This heavenly ink is a compound of all the elements of Christ. The more we are inscribed with this ink, the more we have the elements of Christ dispensed into us. Then we become a letter of Christ with Christ as our content.</p>
<p>In order to be a letter of Christ inscribed with the Spirit of the living God, we must first be captured by Christ. If we have not been captured by Christ, we cannot be inscribed with the Spirit of the living God. To be captured by Christ means that our emotions, intentions, and desires are subdued and captured. Then the Spirit has a free way to write on us whatever He wants to write of Christ. Christ has been put into us (Col. 1:27) as the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). He is within us to write the elements, the riches, of Christ into our whole being, but if we are rebellious in our mind, emotion, and will, there is no way for the Spirit of Christ to write something of Christ into our being. He is waiting for us to be willing to be captured by Christ. If we are conquered, defeated, subdued, and captured by Christ, we will afford the Spirit a free way to write Christ into us.</p>
<p>The inner working of the indwelling Christ is an inner writing. The Spirit of the living God is within us waiting for an opportunity to write something of Christ into our being, into our inward parts. Until we are willing to be captured by Christ, the Holy Spirit can write nothing of Christ into us. Christ is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), but He may not have occupied our mind, emotion, and will. We have Christ within us, but we may be rebellious in our mind, emotion, and will. We need to be defeated, conquered, and subdued, not doctrinally but practically in our mind, emotion, and will. When we are truly subdued by Christ, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ within us, will have the opportunity, the free way, to write something of Christ gradually into our being so that Christ is inscribed into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters.</p>
<p>To read and to study the Word is mainly to feed and nourish our inner man, not merely to acquire the knowledge of the letter (Jer. 15:16; 1 Tim. 4:6; 2 Cor. 3:6). No matter how much knowledge we receive from the Bible, if we are not subdued by Christ and being inscribed with the Spirit of the living God, we can do nothing for the Lord in a way which truly builds up His Body. If we would build up His Body, we must first be defeated. Then we will continually be under the inner writing of the Spirit. There will be a writing, an inscribing, of Christ taking place within us, not by the letter of knowledge in our mind but by the living Spirit in our spirit and from our spirit into our heart. Some element of Christ will be inscribed, wrought, into the inward parts of our being. Something of Christ will be inscribed into our mind, our emotion, and our will so that our whole person, our whole being, will become a letter of Christ. Then we will become a minister with a ministry, not merely a gifted person with a gift. God will then accomplish His economy through us as captives and as living letters of Christ.</p>
<p>Whatever has been revealed in the Scriptures needs to be inscribed into us, not merely by our studying of the Word or our reading of the Bible but by our being willing to be captured by Christ. To be a minister with a ministry that builds up the Body of Christ is not a matter of receiving better teachings or certain help from hearing messages but a matter of Christ inscribing Himself into us in a living, real, and practical way.</p>
<p>If a great deal of the Spirit has been inscribed into our being, we will not always need to function outwardly in church meetings. Sometimes we simply need to let others read us. If in the meetings there are none who have Christ written into them, we will have the sense that the meeting is empty. But if there is even one who has Christ inscribed into him, the meeting will be enriched. Such a one does not need to say anything or do anything. Simply by being present he enriches the meeting, because a great deal of Christ has been written into him by the living Spirit.</p>
<p>We should have the consciousness that while we are ministering to the saints, we are inscribing Christ into their hearts, and they are receiving more of the Spirit as the ink. When we receive the Spirit as the ink, all the elements compounded in the Spirit&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;are added into our being. All these elements are compounded in the divine ink, and the divine ink as the divine element is applied to us by the servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>Our burden is not to preach the gospel or teach the Bible but to write living letters of Christ. If we are to be this kind of writer, we must be one who is constituted with the Triune God. Then, we will not be the one actually doing the writing; the God who has been constituted into us will be the real Writer. He as the Writer will inscribe Himself into the believers.</p>
<p>The function of the ministry of the new covenant is to inscribe living letters of Christ, and the competency, the qualification, of this ministry is God Himself. The writer of these living letters is actually not Paul; the writer is the God who has been constituted into Paul&rsquo;s being. Therefore, God is not only the Writer; He is also the &ldquo;ink,&rdquo; the substance or element, of what is written. This means that God is writing Himself into His chosen people. The result of this writing is a constitution of the Triune God into His people. Thus, the Writer is God, the writing substance is God, and the issue, the result, is also God. The processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is both the Writer and the writing substance. In the writing of living letters of Christ, the Spirit is the substance that is inscribed into us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Inscribed Not in Tablets of Stone<br />
but in Tablets of Hearts of Flesh</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul says that the letter of Christ is inscribed &ldquo;not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.&rdquo; This indicates that a letter of Christ is a letter of a human being. By the dispensing of the Spirit into our being, we human beings become a letter of Christ written by the apostles with the Spirit as the writing substance. Our heart, as the composition of our conscience (the leading part of our spirit), mind, emotion, and will, is the tablet upon which the living letters of Christ are written with the living Spirit of God. This implies that Christ is written into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters.</p>
<p>When the apostles preach or minister Christ, they minister Him into the heart and spirit of the believers. First, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is ministered into a believer&rsquo;s spirit. This means that Christ is written in the spirit of that believer. Then by further ministry Christ spreads from the spirit into the mind, emotion, and will. Eventually, Christ will be written into every part of our inward being. In the words of Ephesians 3:17, this is Christ settling Himself, or making His home, in our heart. Christ making His home in our heart equals the writing of Christ throughout our inner being. This writing causes a believer to become a living letter of Christ. Such a person expresses Christ in whatever he says and does.</p>
<p>Christ today has come into our spirit, but He may not yet be written on our heart. Our heart, which mainly surrounds our spirit, is composed of our mind, emotion, and will, plus our conscience. Therefore, for the Spirit to write Christ on us as living letters means that He writes Christ into our mind, emotion, and will; that is, the Spirit takes our whole heart as the tablet for inscribing Christ. As He does this, we become a complete epistle of Christ, and others can read Christ upon us. When others &ldquo;read&rdquo; our mind, emotion, and will, they will realize that every part of our being is Christ; our thoughts, love, hatred, and intentions are all Christ (cf. Rev. 2:6). The transforming Spirit is waiting for the opportunity to write Christ into our mind, emotion, and will in order to make us complete epistles of Christ. The indwelling Spirit, who is the transforming Spirit, is doing the work of writing in us, but we need to give Him our cooperation. We must let Him have the free course to write something into our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>Christ desires to be written into every part of our inner being, our heart, but we may be preoccupied by many other things. How can Christ be written into us and written on our heart when our heart is preoccupied with other things? Our heart may be preoccupied with our family, material possessions, education, job, or future expectations. There are many things that can usurp the place of Christ in our heart. We may have many preoccupations in our heart, giving no room for Christ to write Himself into us. Furthermore, our heart may be closed to Christ. The preoccupations and the closing of our heart should be dealt with. The filthiness, the uncleanness, of our heart also needs to be dealt with. Is our mind pure? Is our emotion clean? Is our will right? We all need to confess that to one degree or another there is dirt in our mind, emotion, and will. Although we may come to the church meetings, we need to ask ourselves how much of Christ has been written into us. There may be no possibility, no ground, and no opportunity for the Lord to come in to write Himself into us because our heart is filthy, impure, preoccupied with other things, and closed to the Lord. We need to ask ourselves what our situation, condition, and relationship are with the Lord. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we need to open our being to Him. When we open our heart to Him, He writes Himself into us.</p>
<p>The spirit is the innermost part of our being, the hidden man of the heart (1 Pet. 3:4). Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into our spirit to make us alive, to regenerate us, and to indwell us. Christ lives in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Ezekiel 36:26, which tells us that God gives us a new heart and a new spirit, indicates that the heart and the spirit are two things. The Lord wants to inscribe Himself as the Spirit into our heart, &ldquo;in tablets of hearts of flesh&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:3). Thus, this letter is not written on our spirit but on our heart in order that Christ might be expressed and be read by others. A person expresses himself by his mind, emotion, and will. If Christ is written only on our spirit, He will be hidden; He will not be seen, read, or expressed. Christ as the living Spirit must be written on our heart so that He can be expressed and be seen by others.</p>
<p>Christ as the life-giving Spirit desires to be mingled with our mind, emotion, and will in order that there will be the description of Christ in our mind, the definition of Christ in our emotion, and the expression of Christ in our will. Then when others look at our mind, emotion, and will, they will see Christ. For example, a person&rsquo;s love for his or her spouse should be full of Christ, describing and expressing Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord is gracious, patient, and merciful. The Lord is continually waiting for opportunities to mingle Himself with us. Whenever we call on His name, He takes the opportunity to mingle Himself with us. The Lord&rsquo;s main concern is not what we do outwardly but what we are. He wants to dispense Himself, inscribe Himself, into our mind, emotion, and will all the time. He is taking every opportunity to write something of Christ within us little by little. We need to be patient with one another in the church life because more and more of Christ is gradually being wrought into us. This is the Lord&rsquo;s transforming work. In the age of eternity we all will have become the complete letters of Christ. At that time the entire composition of Christ will have been inscribed into our whole being. Christ alone will be the content of our mind, emotion, and will.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

IN THE EPISTLES</h1>

<h2 class="head3">4. As a Mirror</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 reveals that we may express Christ as a mirror.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Beholding Him with Unveiled Face<br />
and Reflecting His Glory</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) With Unveiled Face</h2>
<p>Here the unveiled face is in contrast to the veiled mind, the veiled heart (vv. 14-15). This means that our heart has turned to the Lord so that the veil has been taken away, and the Lord as the Spirit has freed us from the bondage, the veiling, of the law, so that there is no more insulation between us and the Lord.</p>
<p>According to 2 Corinthians, the believers should be mirrors without any kind of veil covering them. This means that we should no longer be covered by the veil of the law. As uncovered mirrors, we should behold the glory of the Lord and thus be transformed.</p>
<p>In order to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, we need to be unveiled. Our face should be fully unveiled so that we may see clearly and reflect properly. Formerly, we were veiled, but now, through the ministry of the apostles, the veil has been taken away. Suppose that a mirror is proper in every way. It is in the right position with respect to the object it is to behold and reflect. But if the mirror is covered with a veil, it loses its function. The veil keeps the mirror both from beholding and from reflecting. Likewise, if we are veiled, we cannot behold and reflect the Lord&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>If, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we will be mirrors beholding and reflecting Him with unveiled face. As a mirror, are you veiled or unveiled? Every one of us needs to be fully unveiled. There should not be a veil between us and the Lord. Experientially speaking, a veil refers to some kind of insulation. No matter how close we may be to the Lord, if we are insulated by a veil, He cannot infuse Himself into us. We may not realize, however, that we are still under certain veils and that these veils insulate us from the Lord&rsquo;s transfusion. We should not assume that we do not have any veils. Instead of taking it for granted that we are fully unveiled, we need to look to the Lord and pray for mercy that all the veils will be taken away so that we may behold and reflect the Lord.</p>
<p>Many Christians cannot behold and reflect the Lord because they are covered by a thick veil or perhaps several layers of veils. For instance, many believers are veiled by religious concepts. Paul&rsquo;s word about beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face was written with his background in Judaism in mind. Paul knew from his experience that the Jews were veiled by their religion. Paul himself had once been veiled in this way. In particular, many Jews were veiled by their concept concerning the law, especially circumcision. Because Paul taught that the law was over and that circumcision was no longer necessary, many Jews were not willing to listen to him. Their doctrine regarding the law and circumcision was a veil that kept them from seeing the Christ preached by Paul.</p>
<p>In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas. Often these veils are related to the kind of people we are by our natural constitution. Furthermore, we are veiled also by our racial and national character. Differences of national character can make it difficult for believers from different countries to worship together. The various national characters, dispositions, habits, and customs are veils that keep us from beholding and reflecting the Lord. Those who are veiled by their racial, national, or cultural characteristics are not able to receive the Christ ministered by one of a different race, nationality, or culture. They may hear a word concerning the glorious, resurrected Christ, but it does not penetrate them. Because they are veiled, they cannot see anything of such a wonderful Christ. The light of the truth cannot shine into them. Those who are veiled in this way can be compared to a camera that has a cover over the lens. When the lens of a camera is covered, no light can come in, and no image can be impressed on the film.</p>
<p>In the transfiguration the face of the Lord Jesus shone as the bright sun. However, the face mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is not simply the outward face but the inward face. We all have an outer face and an inner face. The outer face is simply the expression of the inner face. The outer face is our outward being; the inner face is our inward being. The face is the index, the expression, of our whole being. None of us may have a veil upon our outward face, but many of us still have some veils over our inner face.</p>
<p>Religious and holy things as well as sinful things and worldly things can be a veil to us. If you study the context of 2 Corinthians 3, you will see that the veil mentioned there is specifically the Old Testament in letters. Even the letters in the Bible can be a veil to cover us, keeping us from seeing the living Lord. If the letters of the Bible can be a veil to us, then everything can be a veil&mdash;our spouse, our friends, our children, our siblings, our self, our good behavior, our bad behavior, our zealous activity, and our work for God. All things other than the Lord Himself can be a veil. It does not matter how holy, heavenly, spiritual, or religious a thing is; as long as it is not the Lord Himself, it can be a veil. We may still be under this kind of veiling. That is why we may not see the Lord. If we want to be unveiled, we need to open to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, take away anything that is covering me. Lord, remove my veils. Take away any opinions that are veils to me. Lord, I want to be completely open, absolutely unveiled.&rdquo; Then with an unveiled face we will behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</p>
<p>We need to have an unveiled face beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, just as Moses beheld the glory of God for forty days, and God&rsquo;s glory radiated from the skin of his face (Exo. 34:29). When he came down from the mountain, he was shining, glowing with God&rsquo;s glory. We all need to forget everything good, bad, holy, unholy, religious, unreligious, spiritual, unspiritual. No matter what a thing may be, if it is not the Lord Himself, we must put it aside. We need to recognize the subtlety of the enemy. Satan can utilize anything to turn us away from beholding the Lord. The only thing that Satan cannot utilize is the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are at least four books written specifically about the things that frustrate people from beholding the Lord, things that veil people from contacting and enjoying the Lord. The book of Galatians deals with the law, religion, and tradition, all of which are a veil of separation. The law was given by God and was holy. Even the New Testament says that the law is holy (Rom. 7:12). Yet something holy, such as the law, can sever us from Christ, cutting us off from the enjoyment of Christ (Gal. 5:4). It is possible to be severed from Christ, not only by immoral things but also by the God-given law. This is because our face can be turned to the law instead of Christ. Thus, the law immediately becomes a veil. The law always forms a religion, and religion has long traditions. Hence, we have the law, religion, and traditions, all forming layers of insulation, insulating us from the heavenly electricity which is the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>In Colossians the word <em>philosophy</em> is used (2:8). The word <em>philosophy</em> in this book refers mainly to Gnosticism, a higher philosophy, a composition of Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian philosophy, plus the philosophy of Christianity, which included the Jewish philosophy. That was quite a mixture. That philosophy, the highest product of human culture, came into the early church, causing considerable frustration. Although philosophy may be the best product of human culture, since it is not the Lord, it becomes a veil and must be dealt with.</p>
<p>If we read the book of Hebrews, we will see that it itemizes all the good things of Judaism. Hebrews shows us that all the good things in Judaism should be considered as types, figures, and shadows of Christ. Before Jesus came, God used the Old Testament to present to His people many pictures of Christ from different angles. But the Jewish people held on to the pictures. That enclosed them, keeping them from seeing Christ. Christ is outside of that enclosure. The Jewish people saw so many things about Christ, but they could not see Christ Himself. Thus, the book of Hebrews was written to tell the Jewish believers that they must drop the pictures, the whole system of Judaism, and look at Christ. We need to look away from all the Jewish things. We should only consider the Apostle and High Priest, Jesus Christ (3:1). We need to forget Moses, the angels, and Joshua; instead, we need to look away unto Jesus (12:2).</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians Paul warns us that even the spiritual gifts&mdash;speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, healings, miracles&mdash;can all be veils to a Christian.</p>
<p>The law, philosophy, Judaism with its scriptural items and teachings, and spiritual gifts have become veils over the faces of many Christians. We all need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;I love You. I love the Bible because it reveals You, but I will never let the Bible become a veil. I love You, Lord Jesus. I love You personally, I love You directly, and I love You most intimately. I do not like to see You far away. I like to see You face to face.&rdquo; Many of us have entered into this experience already, but we all need to be preserved in this experience. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I appreciate the gifts because the gifts help me to touch You, but if the gifts become a veil, I will turn away from them. I just love You, Lord. I love You personally, directly, and intimately. I love You in the way that I can kiss You at any time. There is no distance and no separation between You and me. I am directly and intimately in Your presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are mirrors beholding Christ and reflecting Him, but the problem is that sometimes our heart is turned away from the Lord. Thus, we have to turn our heart to Him. Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away (2 Cor. 3:16). The Lord is waiting for us to turn our hearts to Him. He is indwelling our spirit, and our spirit is the hidden man of our heart (1 Pet. 3:4). Our heart must be turned inwardly to the indwelling Christ. Then we will behold Him and reflect Him. We need to turn our hearts to Him all the time, morning and evening, day and night. Even while we are working or driving our car, we must turn our hearts to Him. The more we turn to Him and behold Him, the more we will reflect Him and be transformed into His image.</p>
<p>When we open ourselves to behold Him, He as the living Spirit imparts Himself into us. Whenever we behold the Lord, we return to the spirit. We need to look away from everything unto Jesus, who is the living Spirit in our spirit. When we behold Him, He has the ground and the opportunity to impart Himself into us. This imparting of Himself into us will transform us.</p>
<p>With a mirror there is the need of an unveiled face. There is also the need for the mirror to be turned in the right direction. This is why 2 Corinthians 3:16 tells us that whenever the heart &ldquo;turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; Our heart needs to be turned to the Lord so that we can behold Him with an unveiled face. We may feel that we have given up religion with all its traditions many years ago, but after that, to whom did we turn? We may have turned in the wrong direction. A mirror has to be turned in the direction of our face to behold and reflect us. When the mirror turns to us, it reflects us. We may have given up traditional religion, but where is our direction? Are we directing ourself to the Lord Himself? Have we turned to the Lord? We need to be unveiled and directed to the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>If our heart turns away from the Lord, He will be bound in our spirit and will have no way to come forth or spread out. One day, however, the Lord may touch us, and our heart may turn back to Him. Through the turning and opening of our heart to the Lord, we are able to behold the glory of the Lord face to face. As we behold the Lord day after day in all our situations, we will eventually reflect the Lord&rsquo;s glory and be transformed into His image from glory to glory. In other words, if we open to Him a little today, then we will see something of Him today. If tomorrow we open to Him further, then tomorrow we will see something more of Him. We are like a mirror with an unveiled face aimed at Him. The more we focus on Him and draw near to Him, the clearer and more glorious our reflection of His glory will be.</p>
<p>An unveiled face is a heart that is turned to the Lord. When our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Actually, our turned-away heart is the veil. To turn our heart to the Lord is to take away the veil. Our heart is the crucial factor in our enjoyment of the Lord as the life-giving Spirit and in our being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image. If we would enjoy the Lord as the living Spirit and be transformed by Him, we have to deal with our heart. Our heart needs to be turned to the Lord.</p>
<p>Whenever our heart loves the Lord and turns to Him, our heart and our face toward Him are unveiled. We can then behold Him face to face and fellowship with Him every day. The Lord through His Spirit will fill our being&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;with His glory and with Himself as the Spirit. Consequently, whatever we think about, love, or choose will have the Lord&rsquo;s image because they will all have the Lord&rsquo;s element.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Beholding Him and Reflecting His Glory</h2>
<p>According to verse 18, we behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord. Beholding is to see the Lord by ourselves; reflecting is for others to see Him through us. We are like mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord. As such, our face should be fully unveiled that we may see well and reflect accurately.</p>
<p>We are transformed not only by seeing the Lord but also by reflecting Him. A mirror has the capacity both to behold an object and to reflect it. In English the words <em>beholding and reflecting like a mirror</em> are the translation of a single word in Greek. The use of this word in verse 18 is metaphorical. On the one hand, a mirror beholds a person or an object. On the other hand, a mirror reflects what it beholds. These are the two aspects of the function of a mirror.</p>
<p>The glory in verse 18 is the glory of the Lord as the resurrected and ascended One, who as both God and man passed through incarnation, human living on earth, and crucifixion, entering into resurrection, accomplishing full redemption, and becoming a life-giving Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, He dwells in us to make Himself and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us, that we may be one with Him and be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:8 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; Here seeing God is a great reward in the kingdom. According to the clear view in the New Testament, to see God is to receive God into us. If seeing God is merely an objective seeing of God and nothing else, that means very little. But seeing God is to receive God, and God comes into us as our element to renew us, to transform us, because God&rsquo;s coming in adds the divine element into our being. We first behold God, that is, we see God; then we reflect Him and are transformed. In our seeing God, we are being transformed into His glorious image, from one degree of glory to another. The more we look at Him, the more we receive His elements into our being as our inner supply to work on us, to discharge the old, and to make us new. This is to transform us into God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Our way of looking at God today is altogether a matter in the spirit. The God whom we may look at is the processed and consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, and we can look at Him in our spirit. Sometimes we are too busy or too careless to take the opportunity to look at the Lord. In our morning watch we may take time to be with the Lord, time to remain in the Spirit. At such a time we may pray-read His word, talk to Him, or pray to Him with short prayers. Then we will have the sense that we are receiving something of God&rsquo;s element, that we are absorbing the riches of God into our being. In this way we are under the divine transformation day by day.</p>
<p>If we reflect Christ, there is not always the need for us to stand up and function in the meetings. If Christ has been dispensed into us and if we with an unveiled face have been looking to Christ day by day, we will be a mirror reflecting Him in the meeting. When people look at us, they will see Christ. This is not a matter of functioning but of reflecting. Reflection is much more than function. When we come to the meetings, we need to reflect Christ. This is a matter not of gifts but of growth. As we grow in Christ, more of Him will be imparted into our being by the living Spirit. The Christ who has been imparted into us will be reflected from us. Thus, we become a mirror reflecting Christ. Today Christ needs mirrors. We need to be bright, unveiled mirrors reflecting the Christ who has been dispensed into our being. This will strengthen, uplift, and enrich the Body life.</p>
<p>Today the glory is the resurrected Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit. This means that the Lord as the glory is the Spirit living in us and dwelling in our spirit. Now that we have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit more and more by praying, reading the Word, and calling on the name of the Lord. The more we exercise our spirit with an unveiled face, the more we will behold the Lord. As we are gazing on Him, we will also reflect Him. While we are beholding and reflecting Him in this way, His element, His essence, will be added into our being. This new element will replace and discharge the element of our old, natural life.</p>
<p>When the Lord through His Spirit works His glory, which is Himself as the Spirit, into us and saturates us from our spirit into the three parts of our soul, then we become mature in life from glory to glory. Eventually, our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;our entire inward being&mdash;will be glory.</p>
<p>Every morning we must have fellowship with the Lord, even if we are very busy. Early in the morning, the first thing we need to do is to go to the Lord with an unveiled face to look at Him, behold Him, and reflect Him for a period of time. To linger in the presence of the Lord while beholding and reflecting Him affords us a real taste, a real enjoyment. During such a time in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, as we behold and reflect the Lord, He transfuses Himself into us, and that transfusing brings into us the divine element. Moreover, during the day we must again find time to draw near to Him, to be face to face with Him. Then we will be like a mirror beholding Him and reflecting His glory. Thus, the Lord will transfuse into us the elements of what He is and what He has done. By the power of His life and with His life elements we will gradually be metabolically transformed to have His life shape. We begin every day with an unveiled face, looking to the Lord and calling on His name. His Spirit will then operate within us and will mingle God&rsquo;s life and nature with us in order that we will be transformed into His glorious image.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Being Transformed into His Glorious Image<br />
from Glory to Glory, Even as from the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we &ldquo;are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Being Transformed into His Glorious Image</h2>
<p>When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. <em>Being transformed</em> indicates that we are in the process of transformation.</p>
<p>The constitution of life involves the life essence, the life power, and the life shape. Every kind of life has these three things&mdash;the essence, the power, and the shape. For example, a carnation flower has an essence and a power; therefore, it is formed into a certain shape. As it grows with the life essence and by the life power, it is shaped into a particular form. It is the same with the divine life. This life has its essence, power, and shape. The shape of the divine life is the image of Christ. Thus, in 2 Corinthians 3:18 we have the thought of being transformed into the same image. This means that we will be shaped into the image of Christ. Based upon this fact and upon Paul&rsquo;s use of the word <em>transformed,</em> we speak of being metabolically constituted. This term is based upon the concept of transformation into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to be open to the divine life with its power, essence, and shape. As we open to the Lord, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our being to infuse His life essence into us, to operate within us by His life power, and to shape us into His image. This is the constitution of life to make us ministers of the new covenant.</p>
<p>Paul and his co-workers were mirrors beholding and reflecting with an unveiled face the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image. Man was made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26), and Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God. The glorious image unveiled in 2 Corinthians 3 is the divine image in Genesis 1:26. However, at the time of Genesis 1:26 Christ did not have the elements of incarnation, humanity, His all-inclusive death, and His wonderful resurrection. These elements have now been added to Christ by the process through which the Triune God has passed. Now the image of God is not only the image of divinity; it is the image of divinity mingled with humanity and constituted with the all-inclusive death and the wonderful resurrection.</p>
<p>The image in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. The &ldquo;same image&rdquo; means that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29). According to the usage in the New Testament, <em>image</em> refers not merely to an outward form but to the outward expression of the inner being. The expression of what we are is our image; our image is exactly according to who we are inwardly in our being.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of transforming is through enlightening. Wherever the light shines, life is supplied. By rejecting the light, we are rejecting the supply of life. A believer who experiences the greatest amount of transformation is the one who is absolutely open to the Lord. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am fully open to You. I want to keep opening to You. My whole being is open&mdash;my heart, my mind, my will, and my emotions. Keep shining. Search me thoroughly. Enlighten and enliven me. I will accept it fully.&rdquo; In this way, the light will penetrate into every area, and simultaneously life will be supplied to us. Consequently, we will be transformed into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>Although transformation is a change, it involves more than a mere outward change. Transformation involves a metabolic change, an inward change in life. Such a metabolic change requires the working within us of the element of the divine life. This produces a change not only in appearance and behavior but also in life, nature, and intrinsic essence. In the process of metabolism a new element is supplied to an organism. This new element replaces the old element and causes it to be discharged. Therefore, as the process of metabolism takes place within a living organism, something new is created within it to replace the old element, which is carried away. Metabolism, therefore, includes three matters: first, the supplying of a new element; second, the replacing of the old element with this new element; and third, the discharge or the removal of the old element so that something new may be produced.</p>
<p>This metabolic function, on the one hand, adds the element of the divine life of Christ into our entire being and, on the other hand, discharges the old and negative things from within us. Consequently, we have a change not only in our inward nature but also in our outward image so that we express the image of Christ. Consummately, this image of Christ is the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). Transformation results in our becoming the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When the Lord, who is the Spirit, came into us, He came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Now we are joined to the Lord and have become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The divine Spirit and the human spirit are mingled and blended together to form one spirit. We are one with the Lord not in the body or in the mind; we are one with the Lord in our spirit. When the Lord came into our spirit, a reaction took place in our being. That reaction was our regeneration. Regeneration is the transformation of the spirit. At the moment we believed, our spirit was transformed by Christ as the divine life.</p>
<p>Because we have been regenerated, our spirit is fully transformed. Now we must undergo the continual transformation of the rest of our being, particularly our soul (2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23). The soul is a very important part of our being. For our soul to be transformed means that our mind, emotion, and will are transformed. If we are transformed in our spirit but not in our soul, it means that although we have Christ as life in our spirit, we do not have much of Christ in our soul. Our need is for Christ to increase within us all the time, that is, to spread from our spirit into the three parts of our soul. When we are transformed into His image, we will think, feel, and decide just as Christ thinks, feels, and decides. When we consider matters, we will consider them as the Lord does; when we love or hate, we will love or hate as Christ does; and when we choose, we will choose as the Lord does and give up and reject what the Lord gives up and rejects. When our entire soul has been transformed into the image of Christ, we will have the image of Christ in our daily life.</p>
<p>We need to let Him saturate us and permeate us. The more we behold Him and the more we reflect Him, the more He saturates and permeates us to transform us into His own image that we might express God. This is not only the Lord mingling Himself with us but also the Lord saturating us and even soaking us. When Christ comes into us and saturates us, we are &ldquo;Christified.&rdquo; Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturates us until we are fully Christified. By being Christified, we become Christ. This is why we are Christians. Christ has come into us and has Christified us so that we are now Christians. Christians are simply Christ. This is the corporate Christ as the expression of God (1 Cor. 12:12). The Lord&rsquo;s intention is to recover Christification. We need to be Christified. The church life is the glorious Christification. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to Christify every believer until he obtains a total Christification. This Christification is simply the expression of God.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) From Glory to Glory</h2>
<p>To be transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory is to be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree. This indicates an ongoing process in life in resurrection. We express Christ in this way by experiencing and enjoying the Lord Spirit. This transformation does not happen once for all; it is a gradual matter. The apostles were transformed from one degree of glory to another. The way of transformation is by an increase and an advance, advancing from one degree of glory to another degree of glory (2 Cor. 3:18b). On the pathway of transformation we proceed from one level of glory to another level of glory, from glory to glory, progressively.</p>
<p>The glory in 3:18 is actually the Spirit. This glory also refers to the resurrected Christ, or to Christ in resurrection. The Lord Jesus was glorified by resurrection (Luke 24:26). Hence, the glory, the Spirit, and resurrection all refer to the same thing. Today the Spirit within us is glory and also the reality of resurrection. Therefore, we see that the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is an essence, not an instrument or power.</p>
<p>Likewise, glory here is not an instrument, power, ability, or gift but an essence. As we behold the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, we are being transformed with glory as an essence. The expression <em>from glory to glory</em> in verse 18 means from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit, for in this verse the glory and the Spirit are synonyms. Therefore, to be transformed from glory to glory is to be transformed from the Spirit to the Spirit. We are not being transformed from behavior to behavior, from spirituality to spirituality, or from victory to victory. We are being transformed from glory to glory! The source of this transformation is not doctrine in letters; it is the Lord Spirit. The more we behold the Lord&rsquo;s glory and are transformed by the Lord Spirit from glory to glory, the more the Lord will gain the glorious church that He desires. Transformation will make us glorious. It will cause us to bear the Lord&rsquo;s image, His appearance, and His glorious expression.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Even as from the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>We are transformed even as from the Lord Spirit. It is possible to understand the word rendered &ldquo;even as&rdquo; in 3:18 to mean &ldquo;that is.&rdquo; Hence, the apostles were being transformed from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit. They were being transformed into the image of the Lord Spirit from the Lord Spirit. In verse 18 the word <em>from</em> indicates that the transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than being caused by Him. The phrase <em>from the Lord Spirit</em> indicates a transmission. As we are beholding the Lord, a transmission takes place. This transmission is from the Lord Spirit with the element of the Lord. Transformation requires the addition of another element; without such an addition, transformation cannot take place. Through the transmission from the Lord Spirit, within whom is the element of the Lord, we are transformed from glory to glory.</p>
<p><em>The Lord Spirit</em> in 3:18 may be considered a compound title like <em>the Father God</em> and <em>the Lord Christ.</em> This expression again strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. In 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 the Spirit is mentioned in three aspects: &ldquo;the Lord is the Spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; We have to realize that the Lord is the Spirit to us, and we should call Him the Lord Spirit. To call Him the Lord Spirit is according to the subjective experience of life. If we do not know the divine life, it will be difficult for us to call our Lord Jesus the Lord Spirit. As we are experiencing the divine life in our daily life, we will spontaneously have the sense that the Lord is the Spirit. The more we experience the Lord in life, the more we will realize that the Lord is the Spirit to us.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul does not speak of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, or the Spirit of life. Rather, he refers to the Lord Spirit. In this aspect of the Spirit the element of lordship is included. The Lord Jesus became the Lord after His ascension to the heavens. This means that a man from Nazareth named Jesus has been made the Lord of all. This lordship is now in the Spirit. In the Lord Spirit we have the elements of ascension and lordship.</p>
<p>We are transformed by the Lord Spirit. He is the living Spirit within us. Hence, we need to pay our attention to the Spirit all the time. We should learn to open to Him. If we open ourselves to Him, He will have a way to purify us, purge us, saturate us, permeate us, fill us, mingle Himself with us, and transform us. Transformation takes place by this living One imparting Himself more and more into us. He imparts Himself into us by our drinking Him, eating Him, and breathing Him in. To eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him in are to allow Him to write Himself into us by our beholding Him. He is the living Spirit waiting within us. Therefore, we need to learn to turn ourselves to the Spirit and open to Him. Then He will saturate us, and we as a mirror will behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">5. As Vessels</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4 we see that we may express Christ as vessels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Bearing About the Putting to Death of Jesus</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:10 Paul speaks of &ldquo;always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>the putting to death of Jesus</em> refers to the killing, the deadening; it also refers to the working of death, the working of the cross, which the Lord Jesus suffered and went through. When the Lord was on earth, He was daily under the killing. Day by day He experienced being put to death. The apostles also experienced this. Daily they were under the killing; daily they were being put to death. In our experience this is a kind of suffering, persecution, or dealing that comes upon us for the sake of Jesus, for the sake of the Body of Christ, and for the sake of the new covenant ministry. This does not refer to sufferings and troubles that are common to all human beings in the old creation, such as illness or calamity, or to punishment, correction, or discipline suffered because of sins, mistakes, or failure to fulfill one&rsquo;s responsibility. This putting to death of Jesus consumes our natural man, our outward man, our flesh, so that our inward man may have the opportunity to develop and be renewed (v. 16). To be put to death is to be put into a situation of constantly being killed. This kind of daily putting to death will eventually cause the resurrection life to be manifested. This is the living that we ought to have.</p>
<p>The putting to death of Jesus in our environment cooperates with the indwelling Spirit to kill our natural man (our outer man), comprising our body and our soul. The indwelling Spirit works to kill us. The Spirit is the Killer, but He needs an instrument, a &ldquo;knife,&rdquo; to kill us. The &ldquo;knife&rdquo; may be our spouse, our children, or certain brothers and sisters in the church. A certain saint can become a &ldquo;knife&rdquo; which the Spirit uses to kill us.</p>
<p>We all want to have a nice environment where everything is smooth, peaceful, sweet, and nice. But instead, we are under an environment of sufferings and pressures which works with the Spirit to kill our natural man. The putting to death, the killing, in 2 Corinthians 4 is through the environment. In speaking about the application of Christ&rsquo;s death, Romans 8 refers to the indwelling Spirit, whereas 2 Corinthians 4 refers to the outward environment. The outward environment cooperates with the inward Spirit to carry out the killing of our natural man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Manifesting His Life in Our Body</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:10 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;That the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.&rdquo; The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life. This daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection. Here the life of Jesus refers to the resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross. This portion shows us that the termination of the cross eventually causes the manifestation of the resurrection life. The putting to death of Jesus destroys the natural man, the outward man, and the flesh in order that the inward man can be given the opportunity to develop and be renewed to live out the resurrection life.</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is the manifestation of the divine life. Resurrection is the life of Jesus manifested through His death. Paul wrote the fourth chapter of 2 Corinthians fully from experience. He described how the apostles lived out the crucified life and manifested the resurrection life.</p>
<p>The continual daily grinding works for a specific purpose: that the life of Jesus might be manifested in our body. This life is resurrection life. The Lord Jesus lived resurrection life even before He was crucified. The life that He lived on earth was a life of resurrection.</p>
<p>The death for Jesus&rsquo; sake is the glorious, wonderful, loveable death of Christ. The life of Jesus is resurrection. The death that takes place in Adam is ugly, but the death that takes place in Christ is lovely. Adam died, and Christ also died. However, with one the death was ugly, but with the other the death was lovely. With unbelievers, no affliction is good, but with us, the believers, all afflictions are very good. If persecution befalls us, it is wonderful, but if it befalls an unbeliever, it is terrible. All the negative items in 2 Corinthians 4:8-12 are different aspects of the death of Christ. We may call them sufferings, but according to Philippians 3:10, sufferings are a part of Christ&rsquo;s death. Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; The fellowship, the participation, of His sufferings is the participation in His death. To participate in His death is to be conformed to His death. Every day we are afflicted, perplexed, cast down, and persecuted, and our outward man is decaying, being consumed. These are different aspects of Christ&rsquo;s death. When we are suffering these things, Christ&rsquo;s death is being applied to us. Through this death the life of Christ is manifested.</p>
<p>A sister may love her daughter very much but only with her natural emotion. If God desires this sister to grow in spirit, He must stretch out His hand to deal with her natural love for her daughter. This is a putting to death, a killing. We also may be very clever, relying on our mind in everything that we do, rather than relying on our spirit. Consequently, God will raise up one situation after another to kill our cleverness. This is a genuine experience, and it may be not only painful but also long lasting. Paul says that the putting to death of Jesus operates in us so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Being Delivered unto Death for His Sake<br />
That His Life Might Be Manifested in Our Mortal Flesh</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:11 Paul declares, &ldquo;We who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.&rdquo; The title <em>Jesus</em> in verses 10 and 11 implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth. The Lord&rsquo;s life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry (John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24). The use of <em>flesh</em> and <em>body</em> interchangeably in 2 Corinthians 4:10-11 indicates that the mortal flesh is our fallen body.</p>
<p>In order for the life of God to come out of the Lord Jesus, He had to pass through death. He indicated that without death there would be no life (John 12:24). Without death as the pathway, life cannot be released. The way of life is the way of death; wherever there is death, there is a way for life to come out. The expression of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us is contingent upon one thing&mdash;death. The extent to which death has worked in us is the extent to which the Lord&rsquo;s life has a way to come out of us. For this reason, even Paul, who was full of experience and was mature in life, pursued to know Christ&rsquo;s death; he wanted to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10). He pursued this death because he knew that the extent to which death worked in him would be the extent to which the Lord&rsquo;s life could be released from him.</p>
<p>The death that operates in us and the putting to death of Jesus are the realization and application of the death of Christ in our daily life. The more we pass through death, the more life will be expressed from us. For example, a brother who quarrels with his wife may endeavor to express the Lord and to allow the Lord&rsquo;s life to flow out. However, his natural strength is insufficient to express Christ and to allow His life to flow out. Once he is under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, however, the Spirit will enable him to cooperate with and submit to the Holy Spirit. Then his wife will sense a flavor of Christ coming from him, and she will see to some extent Christ&rsquo;s life in him because the death of the cross has been realized and is being carried out in him. The cross brings in both death and the expression of the resurrection life.</p>
<p>The Spirit leads us into the death of the cross hour by hour and day by day. This is the leading and work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in us wants to bring us into death every moment. The stronger the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work in us is, the stronger our experience of the cross will be. Without the death of the cross, there is no work of the Holy Spirit; wherever the Holy Spirit works, there is a putting to death by the Spirit.</p>
<p>From morning until evening and from evening until morning, the Holy Spirit is working in us. He requires that we receive the cross, and He puts us into the death of the cross. The way of life is death, and death is the way of life. When we walk on the way of life, we walk on the way of the death of the cross. The Christian life is a living of the cross and a living of death. Every day we experience death in the Holy Spirit, and we live and walk under death. Death deals with our person. As we are dealt with and broken, the life of God in us will have a free way.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:11 Paul does not use the adjective <em>manifest.</em> Instead, he uses the verb <em>be manifested.</em> There is a difference between something that is manifest and something manifested. The word <em>manifest</em> does not involve experience or a process, but <em>manifested</em> involves a process, a procedure. In these verses Paul does not say that the life of Jesus may be manifest. If he had said this, no process or procedure would have been involved. There would be no need for us to go through anything in our experience. But when Paul speaks of the life of Jesus being manifested in us, that involves a process and requires a procedure. In verses 10 through 12 we can definitely see the manifestation of life.</p>
<p>In verse 11 we may expect Paul to speak of being rescued from death, instead of being delivered unto death. Paul, however, was always being delivered unto death so that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh. Paul preferred to be small and to remain in a lowly state. In fact, the name <em>Paul</em> means &ldquo;little.&rdquo; The life manifested in Paul was the life of a Nazarene, not the life of a great man in the world. Moreover, the life of Jesus was manifested in his mortal flesh. Paul did not consider himself a great person manifesting something marvelous in a splendid body. Instead, he considered himself a small person manifesting the life of Jesus, a man from Nazareth, in his mortal flesh.</p>
<p>When we consider the record of the Lord&rsquo;s life on earth, we see that the emphasis is not on works. The four Gospels do not stress what the Lord did, what works He accomplished. The record concerning the Lord Jesus in the Gospels is mainly a record of life. In the Gospels the emphasis is on life, not on works or activities. The Gospels are biographies presenting a person living in a particular way. Therefore, the Gospels are not primarily an account of the Lord&rsquo;s marvelous works; they are a description of the life the Lord Jesus lived on earth. This is one reason that Paul in 2 Corinthians 4 uses the name <em>Jesus</em> so often. The use of this name in chapter 4 brings us back to the Lord as a man whose life was one with His ministry. The Lord lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry. Strictly speaking, the Lord did not accomplish a work. Instead, He simply lived a certain kind of life. The portrait in the Gospels was painted in such a way as to show forth the Lord&rsquo;s life. The Gospels do describe the Lord&rsquo;s works, but much more the Gospels present the life Jesus lived and show us by what way He lived.</p>
<p>There are a number of indications in the Gospels that the Lord Jesus did not care for the accomplishing of a great work. One example of the Lord&rsquo;s caring for life and not for a work is found in John 12. In Jerusalem a great crowd gave a warm welcome to the Lord Jesus. They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, crying, &ldquo;Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&rdquo; (v. 13). Even the Pharisees admitted that the world had gone after Him (v. 19). But when Andrew and Philip told the Lord that the Greeks were seeking Him, He answered, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). This indicates clearly that what the Lord Jesus cared for was life, not work. In the four Gospels there are many illustrations of this. Whenever people, according to their concept, thought that the opportunity was right for the Lord to accomplish a great work, He never took advantage of that opportunity. Instead, He departed. He had not come to do a great work. His concern was life.</p>
<p>Jesus of Nazareth did not seek to be great or famous. On the contrary, He was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died. In this way Jesus became the first Minister of the new covenant. We need to follow Him to also become ministers of the new covenant. The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death so that He might release His eternal life to the many grains in resurrection. As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection. Concerning this, we must look to the Lord and pray desperately to Him. We need to tell the Lord that we are willing to be today&rsquo;s Paul, not a great person or a famous believer, but a small man, a crucified man, even a Nazarene.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Having His Death Operate in Us<br />
That His Life May Be Imparted through Us into Others</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:12 Paul says, &ldquo;So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; When we are under the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others. The impartation of life into others is always the issue of our suffering the killing of the cross. While we are dying, others are being made alive. Our dying infuses life into them and makes them alive. For us, it is a matter of being put to death; for them, it is a matter of the impartation of life.</p>
<p>The work of the apostles is the work of death operating in them so that life may operate in the believers. It may not sound pleasant to us to hear of death operating in the apostles. But the issue, the result, of this operation of death is wonderful&mdash;it is life in others. This is the real work of the new covenant ministry. It is not a matter of working; it is a matter of dying. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need to die so that life may work in others. Hence, our dying is our working. The Lord does not need us to accomplish a work for Him. He needs us to die. If we die, life will work in others. We will minister life to others by dying. The apostles were not followers of a great person but of a small man, Jesus of Nazareth. Furthermore, instead of being exalted, they were always being put to death so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in their mortal flesh. Death operated in them so that life might operate in the believers. Christ&rsquo;s death was always killing them. The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life. This daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. As Vessels to Be Broken<br />
That the Treasure Within May Be Expressed</h2>
<p>In verse 7 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; We know that the expression <em>earthen vessels</em> refers not merely to our body but to us; we are made of clay and are earthen vessels. <em>This treasure</em> refers to God and His life, that is, Christ and His life. <em>We have this treasure in earthen vessels</em> means that we have Christ in us, that is, in our inner man. In fact, our inner man is Christ; our outer man is we ourselves. Hence, verse 16 says, &ldquo;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; This means that while we are being broken by God, Christ is being built up in us.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Christ is the treasure, and we are the earthen vessels to contain Him. On the other hand, we need to be broken, consumed, and reduced so that Christ as the treasure can be manifested from within us (vv. 8-12, 16-17). After we allow Christ to come into us, we as vessels need to be broken in order that Christ as the treasure might be expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) As Vessels</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels! This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry. This has been accomplished by the divine power in resurrection. The excellency of the power is surely of God and not out of us. The ministers of the new covenant were earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure (v. 7). These vessels are like today&rsquo;s camera, into which Christ the figure enters through the flash of God&rsquo;s shining (vv. 4, 6).</p>
<p>This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life. It is by the excellent power of this treasure that the apostles as the ministers of the new covenant were capable of living a crucified life that the resurrection life of Christ, whom they ministered, might be manifested. Thus, they manifested the truth (v. 2) for the shining of the gospel.</p>
<p>Earthen vessels containing a treasure is a metaphor used to describe the ministers of the new covenant and their ministry. Second Corinthians 4 leads us into the real experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. We are the earthen vessels, yet we have a treasure in us. This demonstrates the excellency of the power of the treasure in death and resurrection. Christ&rsquo;s power is not only manifested in resurrection but also in death. The four Gospels show us how Christ passed through a long journey of death while not being put down by death; the many aspects of death could not restrain Him. He had the power to overcome death. In death the power of Christ was greatly manifested. In His resurrection His power was also manifested. There was no way to subdue Paul because as an earthen vessel he had Christ as the treasure within him. In this way, the excellent power of the treasure was manifested. This was not of man but of God. We also are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure. Day after day we may express the all-inclusive death of Christ and the resurrection power. How much of this treasure we have in us is indicated by how much we express Christ in His all-inclusive death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) To Be Broken That the Treasure Within<br />
May Be Expressed</h2>
<p>There is a need for the hand of God to break our being outwardly; that is, there is a need for the Spirit of God to arrange the outward environment to break and consume our being. The word <em>consume</em> comes from 2 Corinthians 4:16, which says, &ldquo;Our outer man is decaying.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>decaying</em> in verse 16 means &ldquo;being consumed,&rdquo; &ldquo;being wasted away,&rdquo; or &ldquo;being worn out.&rdquo; By the continued killing, the working of death, our outer man, that is, our material body with its animating soul (1 Cor. 15:44 and footnote 1), is being consumed and worn out. <em>Decaying</em> in 2 Corinthians 4:16 is God&rsquo;s dealing in verses 8 through 11.</p>
<p>The outer man, physically, is our body; psychologically, it is our soul. The outer man is our soul, that is, our self. The outer man being consumed means that our self is being consumed; that is, our mind, emotion, and will are being consumed. A brother may have great intellect, a strong mind, and clear thinking, but all of these can frustrate the pneumatic Christ in him. Hence, God will raise up an environment to deal with his mind and thought. This is God&rsquo;s striking him in the environment and God&rsquo;s tearing down of his mind with His hand. Such a dealing tears down his mind to the extent that when he encounters a certain matter, he does not dare to rely on his mind. This may be compared to the situation of Jacob. At one time his legs could run very well; moreover, he had a mind that was able to think of many ways to fight and supplant. His mind was clever, resourceful, and full of schemes. One day, however, God met him and dealt with him severely, touching his hip and crippling him (Gen. 32:25). After this, Jacob could no longer run. This is the breaking. Some people who are intelligent and have a very clever mind use their mind in spiritual matters. Such ones do not know how to touch the feeling of God, nor do they know how to live in the spirit. Instead, they allow their mind and intellect to take the lead in everything. When God begins to deal with them, especially with their mind and intellect, they may lose their confidence in their thinking ability. When they encounter similar situations in the future, their spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position. With respect to their mind, their outer man is torn down, but their inner man is being renewed.</p>
<p>In the same principle, God strikes our emotion to the extent that it fails us, and we no longer have any confidence in it. At such a time, our spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position and have preeminence over our emotion. It is the same with our will. God&rsquo;s striking and tearing down are a very painful process. Even the apostle Paul was no exception.</p>
<p> Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the &ldquo;putting to death of Jesus&rdquo; and &ldquo;being delivered unto death&rdquo; (vv. 10, 11). Christ is killing us. He is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the killing Spirit. Christ is always putting us to death to reduce and consume us in our outer man, our natural man, so that our inner man may have the opportunity to develop and be renewed (v. 16). The real growth in the divine life is to be reduced. We need to be reduced and broken. The killing of Jesus accomplishes the reducing of our natural life. Without this killing, we cannot enjoy Christ&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Whereas the outer man is being consumed, the inner man is being renewed. It is renewed through being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life. As our outer man is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inner man, that is, our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 7:22, 25), is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of resurrection life. Actually, the renewing of the inner man is a matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>It is not an easy task for the Lord to consume our outer man. In order to accomplish this, He allows us to pass through many kinds of sufferings. Because we imprison Him, He must do the further work of breaking us and renewing us.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may be bothered by the fact that the more we love the Lord, the more we grow in Him, and the more spiritual we become, the more problems we have. For example, the more a certain young person prays, the more he may be persecuted by members of his family. The reason we suffer more as we grow more in the Lord is that we need to be broken; that is, we need to experience the consuming of the outer man in order that Christ will no longer be imprisoned within us.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:8-10 we have expressions such as <em>being pressed on every side, unable to find a way out, persecuted, cast down,</em> and <em>always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus.</em> In verse 16 Paul tells us that the outer man is decaying. This is not only the reducing of our outer man but also the breaking of the vessel.</p>
<p>God is doing a work not only to reduce us but also to crush us, to break us. We should not try to keep ourselves so complete, so whole. The Lord wants to break our outer man, the natural man, including the soul and the flesh. Our human element, the soulish life, the fleshly element, all need to be broken. The outer man is the self with the natural life, with the soulish life, and with the flesh. To know what the natural man, the flesh, and the soul are is one thing, but to experience the breaking of the outer man, the holy brokenness, is another thing.</p>
<p>In following the Lord, we should not expect that we will always have a &ldquo;safe journey.&rdquo; In taking the way that leads to life, the narrow and constricted way to follow the Lord (Matt. 7:14), we will be afflicted, perplexed, persecuted, and cast down. We will be put to death, destroyed, crushed, and broken. The Lord has myriads of ways to crush us. We need to realize that we are not in our own hands. We are in His hands. No one knows what tomorrow may bring. Even David said to the Lord in Psalm 31:15, &ldquo;My times are in Your hand.&rdquo; We need to praise Him, however, that His hand is the sovereign hand, the gracious hand, and the merciful hand. We should not be afraid. We need to be at peace to take whatever He measures to us and whatever He assigns to us. Because we have the treasure within this vessel, the destiny for this vessel is to be broken.</p>
<p>To be a person in the spirit in the Holy of Holies, we need to be vessels that are broken. We need to bring all these points to the Lord and pray thoroughly. We need to pray ourselves into these points so that we realize subjectively that we are vessels who are always under His dealing, under His breaking, to fulfill His burden to express the treasure within. We need to tell the Lord that we are willing to open ourselves for His working in us. We should tell Him that we are willing to be broken, ground, and constituted; that we are willing to live a crucified life; and that we are willing to renounce and deny ourselves and daily be constituted with the elements of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>In summary, as vessels, we bear the putting to death of Jesus. The putting to death of Jesus is continually upon us. This means that we are continually put to death by the working of the cross. When we are under the putting to death of Jesus, His life is manifested in our body. We are delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that His life might be manifested in our mortal flesh. We experience this not only while suffering persecution but also through our daily interaction with the fellow believers. For example, believers who live in a house may cause one another to experience the killing of the cross. In married life, a husband and wife may similarly deliver one another to death. Our being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake is for the manifestation of His life in our mortal flesh. Hence, although there is much working of the cross in the church life and marriage life, simultaneously there is much manifestation of life. The more we are under the killing of the cross, the more life will be imparted through us into all those who deliver us to death. For this to take place, we must be willing to experience the killing of the cross. If we are willing to be under the daily killing, we will become life-imparters, even to those who deliver us to death. Moreover, in our daily life none of us as vessels should remain whole but be broken. If we have been in the church life yet have remained whole, then no life has ever been manifested and imparted through us into others. Through married life, a husband and wife may become broken. A broken wife is one who manifests life; a broken husband is one who imparts life to others. As vessels, we need to be broken so that Christ as the treasure within us may be expressed.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">6. Through Life or through Death</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:19-21 we see that we may express Christ through life or through death. All of Paul&rsquo;s life and work were not for expressing himself or for displaying his knowledge, ability, or other merits and strong points; what he was and what he did were for expressing Christ, even magnifying Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Magnifying Him Always in Our Body</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:20 Paul declares, &ldquo;According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&rdquo; In the apostle&rsquo;s suffering in his body, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared to be great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled. The apostle would have only Christ magnified in him, not the law or circumcision. To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment. To magnify Christ is much greater than to express Him. We should not only express Christ but also magnify Him in our body.</p>
<p>In verse 20 a number of expressions are related to Paul&rsquo;s statement that Christ would be magnified in him: <em>with all boldness, as always, even now, in my body,</em> and <em>whether through life or through death.</em> Paul does not simply say, &ldquo;With boldness,&rdquo; but he says, &ldquo;With all boldness.&rdquo; Then he specifically points out that Christ would be magnified in his body. He says this because his body was in chains. At least during the night, if not all the time, Paul was chained to a guard. Nevertheless, even though his body was in chains, Christ would be magnified in his body. Moreover, Christ would be magnified whether through life or through death. This indicates that no matter what the circumstances were, Paul expected Christ to be magnified in him.</p>
<p>Now we must consider what it means to magnify Christ. The word <em>magnify</em> means to make something large to our sight. Perhaps we may wonder how Christ can be magnified since He is already universally great. According to Ephesians 3, the dimensions of Christ&mdash;the breadth, length, height, and depth&mdash;are immeasurable (vv. 18-19). They are the dimensions of the universe. Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of the Praetorian guard, the imperial guard of Caesar, Christ was virtually nonexistent. In their eyes there was not such a person as Jesus Christ. However, Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison. As a result, some eventually turned to Christ. Evidence of this is found in Philippians 4:22, where Paul speaks of the saints in Caesar&rsquo;s household. Through Paul&rsquo;s magnification of Christ, even some in Caesar&rsquo;s household were saved.</p>
<p>At the time of Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment, the Jews were despised by the Romans. The Romans were the conquerors, and the Jews were the conquered ones. Among these conquered ones there was a man named Jesus. Although He is great and most wonderful, in the eyes of the Romans He was nothing. But as Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him appear great in the eyes of his captors.</p>
<p>In our daily living we also should magnify Christ, making Him great in the eyes of others. People may look down on Christ where we work or go to school. They may ridicule Him and take His name in vain, in violation of the third commandment (Exo. 20:7). Therefore, we need to let others see Christ, not in a small way but in the way of enlargement, of magnification.</p>
<p>We should also magnify Him at home. The parents of some of the young people may not believe in Christ but instead despise Him. Hence, these young people must bear the responsibility to enlarge Christ before their parents. Instead of simply preaching to their parents about Christ, they need to magnify Him. We need not only the life within but also the living without. Through the proper living, Christ will appear to be great in the eyes of others. Young people should let their parents see Christ&rsquo;s greatness in them.</p>
<p>We can magnify Christ even in situations where we have little or no liberty to speak about Him. Although teachers may not be able to preach the gospel to their students, they can magnify Christ in the classroom. They can cause Christ to appear great in the eyes of their students. It is not likely that when Paul was in prison, he was free to do much preaching of Christ. On the contrary, he was very limited and under strict control. However, even in such circumstances, Christ was magnified in his body. With all boldness Paul sought to magnify Him always.</p>
<p>At the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was an elderly person. No doubt, the guards expected him to be exhausted by his imprisonment. But far from being exhausted, Paul was full of joy and rejoicing in the Lord (1:18, 3:1; 4:4). He was shining forth Christ and expressing Him. Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ and a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could be happy and display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ. In particular, Paul displayed Christ&rsquo;s inexhaustible patience. Christ certainly was magnified in Paul&rsquo;s physical body. Day by day Paul was happy in the Lord. His happiness did not diminish as time went by. In his happiness he could show forth the immeasurable Christ whom he experienced and enjoyed. By this way Paul expressed, exhibited, exalted, and extolled Christ. Instead of offending or being offended by the jailers, Paul was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure. The guards may have considered Paul to be strange or peculiar, viewing him as possessing something which they did not have. What they sensed in Paul was Christ magnified. While he was in prison, Paul expressed the greatness of Christ in an enlarged way. He magnified Christ with all boldness both through life and through death. By magnifying Christ in this way, Paul could overcome any situation.</p>
<p>Our natural love is eventually exhausted, but Christ as love is inexhaustible. Likewise, our natural patience is limited, but Christ as our patience is without limit. We all have the capacity to be patient, but only to a certain extent. Then we become provoked and angry. For example, a brother may exercise patience with his wife. Eventually, however, this patience reaches its limit, and he becomes angry with her. Although our natural patience is limited, Christ as patience is inexhaustible and immeasurable.</p>
<p>Paul says that Christ would be magnified in him, whether through life or through death. No matter what faced him&mdash;the opportunity to go on living or to be martyred&mdash;Paul expected to magnify Christ. In his living, Paul magnified Christ. This is to magnify Him through life. As he was expecting to be martyred, he also magnified Him. This is to magnify Christ through death. Thus, whether through life or death, Christ was magnified in Paul&rsquo;s imprisoned and chained body. Obviously, this is not mere doctrine; it is the genuine experience of Christ.</p>
<p>In Philippians 1:19 Paul mentions the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we allow the bountiful supply of the Spirit to work in us, our daily living will be changed. We will be burdened to magnify Christ always and with all boldness. Through our magnifying of Christ, others will see His greatness and His unlimitedness. To magnify Christ in such a way surely is to live Him.</p>
<p>The experience of Christ in Philippians can be primarily related to four aspects: our circumstances, the unbelievers, the believers, and God. First, we magnify Christ in any kind of circumstance, condition, state, or situation, whether through life or through death. No matter what happens to us, we must remember that within us there is the all-inclusive Spirit supplying us all the time. We overcome all the troubles and hardships, and nothing can oppress, depress, suppress, or overcome us. In 4:12 Paul says, &ldquo;In everything and in all things I have learned the secret,&rdquo; and in 1:20 he says, &ldquo;Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&rdquo; As persons existing on this earth and living among humanity, we cannot escape our circumstances. Every day we encounter certain situations. If we prefer not to live in one place, we may have more difficult circumstances when we move to another place. In order to be a normal believer living in the spirit, we must first deal with our circumstances. We should praise the Lord and thank Him for His sovereignty and wisdom. The sovereign, wise hand of the Lord always arranges our circumstances for us and assigns them to us. If we need a wife, He will assign a proper, suitable wife, and if we need a certain kind of child, He will give us such a one. He also knows what kind of health we need, and He assigns it to us. We should not complain, because all things are under His sovereign and wise hand. The Lord knows what we need, He is never wrong, and He assigns us our circumstances accordingly. Therefore, in order to live in the spirit by Christ as our life, we must learn the secret of how to deal with our circumstances, how to be abased and how to abound, and how to be poor and how to be rich (4:12). Then we will be able to magnify Christ. Paul had learned the secret, and he could do all things, not in himself but in Him who empowered him (v. 13). The One who empowers us in this way is the empowering Spirit. No matter what our state or circumstance may be, we can do all things in Him who empowers us so that He may be magnified in our body. This is the experience of Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit so that He may be magnified in any kind of circumstance.</p>
<p>Second, in order to magnify Christ, we need to preach and impart Him to the unbelievers, presenting Him as the good tidings. This is the reason that Philippians mentions the preaching of the gospel, the good work begun by the Lord in us (1:5-7, 12-14, 18, 27). If we intend to magnify Christ, we must preach the gospel to present Christ to the unbelievers. The all-inclusive Spirit within us constantly supplies us for preaching the gospel. In order to experience Christ and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we need to do the work of preaching the gospel. The more we preach the gospel to present Christ to people, the more we will enjoy the bountiful Spirit within us. To preach the gospel is an enjoyment. On the other hand, if we do not preach the gospel to present Christ to others, we will suffer the loss of the supply of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Third, in order to magnify Christ, we must fellowship with the believers. In order to fellowship with the saints, we should open to them in order for the Spirit to flow out of us into them, and we should help them to open to us for the Spirit to flow out of them into us. This is a two-way traffic, a flowing out and a flowing in. We present Christ and impart Him to the unbelievers, and we also serve Him to the believers, fellowshipping the glorious Christ with one another.</p>
<p>Fourth, we magnify Christ by serving and worshipping God by the Spirit of God. In Philippians 3:3 Paul gives us a contrast between serving God by the Spirit and by the flesh. According to chapter 3, Paul had many virtues to boast of according to the flesh (vv. 4-6). However, he learned the lesson not to serve God by the virtues of the flesh. He gave up all these things and left no ground for them in his service to God. Instead, he learned to serve God by the Spirit. According to the context of this chapter, to serve God by the Spirit is a matter of the resurrection life (v. 10). The Spirit is the reality of the power of resurrection; He is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who includes both human suffering and resurrection. Resurrection power is nothing less than the Spirit Himself. To worship and serve God by the Spirit is to worship and serve in the resurrection power, not in anything natural, in the flesh, or by our self. Paul had virtues in the flesh of which he could boast, but he had seen the vision and learned the secret to give up the good flesh and worship God simply and absolutely in the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. This is the meaning of serving God by the Spirit. In order to magnify Christ, we must deal with our circumstances by the empowering Spirit, present Christ to the unbelievers, fellowship with the believers, and serve God by the Spirit of God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. To Live Him</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:20 Paul speaks of his magnification of Christ in his body. In verse 21 Paul continues, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; The little word <em>for</em> at the beginning of this verse is important. It indicates that what is to follow is an explanation of the preceding verse, which speaks of Paul&rsquo;s magnification of Christ in his body. Christ could be magnified in Paul&rsquo;s body because Paul lived Christ. In order to magnify Christ, we must live Him. Although the matter of living Christ is of such tremendous importance, not many Christians have paid adequate attention to it. In Paul&rsquo;s chained body Christ was exalted, extolled, praised, and appreciated because Paul lived Christ. To live Christ means that no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us, and we are not put to shame in anything. Furthermore, to live Christ also means that in our daily life we are saved from murmurings, reasonings, crookedness, and perverseness and that we present our living Lord as the word of life to those whom we meet day by day (2:14-16). To live Christ for His magnification is to participate in Christ&rsquo;s salvation in life (Rom. 5:10), in which we are saved from the failure of not living Christ and from the defeat of not magnifying Christ.</p>
<p>Paul could say not only that Christ lived in him (Gal. 2:20) but also that to him to live was Christ. On the one hand, Christ lived in Paul; on the other hand, Paul lived Christ. Inwardly Christ was Paul&rsquo;s life, and outwardly Christ was Paul&rsquo;s living. Paul and Christ thus had one life and one living. Christ&rsquo;s life was Paul&rsquo;s life, and Paul&rsquo;s living was Christ&rsquo;s living. The two, Christ and Paul, lived as one. First Corinthians 6:17 refers to such a living. In this verse Paul says that we are one spirit with the Lord. The organic union that has taken place between us and Christ causes us to be so close and intimate with Him that we are even one spirit with Him.</p>
<p>To live Christ is deeper than to live by Christ or to live out Christ. We can be helped to know what it means to live Christ by reading the Gospel of John. This Gospel reveals that Christ, the Word, is God (1:1). One day, the Word became flesh (v. 14); that is, God was incarnated. Referring to the Word made flesh, John the Baptist declared, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; (v. 29). The third chapter of the Gospel of John speaks of regeneration. Here we see that we must be born of God through the Spirit in our spirit (v. 6).</p>
<p>In John 14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord also went on to say, &ldquo;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me&rdquo; (v. 11). The Lord Jesus was one with the Father. To see Him was to see the Father. In this chapter the Lord Jesus also spoke of the Spirit of reality, telling the disciples that the Spirit of reality abode with them and would be in them (v. 17). The Lord Jesus indicated that when the Spirit of reality came, He Himself would come also. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; Verse 20 continues, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; Here we have our living together with Christ. We are in Christ, and Christ is in us. This means that we and He live together. He lives, and we live also. We live in Him, by Him, and with Him. We even live Him. In John 15 the Lord gave the very impressive illustration of the vine and the branches. He said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches&rdquo; (v. 5). The branches are the living of the vine.</p>
<p>If we magnify Christ by living Him, we will become strong factors, channels of supply, to enable the saints to grow in life and enjoy the Lord (Phil. 1:22-26). When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he was living in prison and not outwardly working. Yet he speaks of &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; for his &ldquo;work&rdquo; (v. 22). This indicates that his work was actually his living. The fruit of this work was Christ lived out, magnified, ministered, and transfused into others. The fruit of this work was the issue, the result, of Paul&rsquo;s living in prison. Paul&rsquo;s living work was to minister Christ to others and to transfuse the Christ whom he magnified into them. Through Paul&rsquo;s magnification of Christ, even some in Caesar&rsquo;s household were saved (4:22). Possibly Paul&rsquo;s enjoyment of Christ in prison was a factor in bringing Onesimus, a runaway slave, to salvation (Philem. 10).</p>
<p>Paul also says to the believers in Philippi, &ldquo;I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith&rdquo; (1:25). Here <em>progress</em> refers to the growth in life, and <em>joy</em>, to the enjoyment of Christ. This indicates that Paul was a factor of the saints&rsquo; growth in life and of their enjoyment of Christ. Whether or not we are such factors of the progress and joy of others depends on whether or not we magnify Christ by living Him. If we live Christ, He will surely be magnified in us. Then we will become factors to enable the saints to grow in life and enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>Because Paul lived and magnified Christ to the uttermost, he could transfuse Christ into the saints and minister Christ to all the churches. It should matter to the church whether we remain or go to be with the Lord, but this depends on our living Christ, magnifying Christ, ministering Christ, and transfusing Christ from the depths of our being into that of the saints (cf. 2:25-30). In the Body life there is the urgent need of certain ones to function as channels of supply (cf. Zech. 4:12-14; Judg. 9:9). We need members of the Body like Paul. When such members die, the transfusion of Christ is in a very real sense interrupted, but as long as such ones are with us, the transfusion continues unabated.</p><h2 class="head4">c. By the Bountiful Supply of His Spirit</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:19, Paul indicates that he lived Christ for His magnification by &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In this verse he declares, &ldquo;This will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The salvation here is not eternal salvation; it is a subjective, experiential, and constant salvation in our daily life for magnifying Christ. It is the working out of the salvation in 2:12, and it means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ. This requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:19 indicates that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the bountiful supply. The Spirit of Jesus has the bountiful supply, which comes from all the processes that Christ passed through. It has the supply of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All that Christ went through became a source, a factor, of this bountiful supply. After incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He became the Spirit. Today this Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:19 speaks neither of the Spirit of God nor of the Holy Spirit but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This divine title signifies all the processes that this dear One underwent. Before the incarnation, He was God, and the Holy Spirit was the Spirit of God. Yet in Christ, God was incarnated and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He then entered death, passed through death, conquered death, subdued death, overcame death, and came out of death. This was certainly a process. He went on to enter resurrection, in which He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. In the Spirit, in resurrection, He ascended to the heavens. Today He is the life-giving Spirit. As such, He is not merely the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Jesus Christ with all the elements and factors of His processes. Hence, He has the bountiful supply to support us in order that we may magnify Him and live Him regardless of our situation, whether it be through life or through death.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; mentioned in John 7:39. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, compounded with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, a compound of olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit to Paul was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God.</p>
<p>We need to see what the bountiful supply of the Spirit includes. First, the bountiful supply includes the divine person with the divine life and nature. Thus, the bountiful supply includes divinity. Divinity includes the divine life, nature, being, and person; in other words, it is God Himself. In the bountiful supply we have God with His life, nature, being, and person.</p>
<p>The bountiful supply also includes an uplifted humanity, a humanity with a proper life, living, nature, and person. The Lord Jesus is both God and man. Within Him there are both divinity and humanity. Thus, when He was on earth, He lived as God and also as man. All that the Lord passed through in thirty-three and a half years of life on earth is now in the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, divinity and humanity, including the human living of the Lord Jesus, are in the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>On the cross the Lord Jesus died a wonderful death. The all-inclusive death of Christ dealt with every negative thing in the universe. By His death all sinful things were terminated. This wonderful death is also included in the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension are included as well. Now in the bountiful supply of the Spirit we have Christ&rsquo;s divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>The bountiful supply of the Spirit also includes the divine attributes and the human virtues. God is love and light, and He is holy and righteous. These are some of His attributes. Furthermore, as a man Christ has all the human virtues. Both the divine attributes and the human virtues are in the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The submission and love that we need day by day are also found in the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Although the Bible commands a wife to submit to her husband and a husband to love his wife (Eph. 5:24-25), in ourselves we actually do not have either genuine submission or love. Instead of submission, we have rebellion. Instead of a proper love, we have an unbalanced, twisted love. True submission and love are in the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</p>
<p>As we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we partake of the ingredients of this supply without being aware of it. For example, we may love others without being conscious of the fact that we are loving. In like manner, we may be submissive without realizing that we are submissive. However, if we deliberately try to love or submit, our love or submission will not be genuine. True love and true submission are always spontaneous and not something of which we are conscious. A sister who is genuinely submissive to her husband has no consciousness of being submissive, for her submission comes out of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Real submission is spontaneous; it is the issue of enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Actually, every kind of religion teaches people to act in a political way. Under this influence, we may think that for the sake of our husband or wife, for the sake of our children or relatives, and even for the sake of the church, we should behave in a particular way. But whenever we try to behave ourselves apart from enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we are political and hypocritical.</p>
<p>The source of true virtue is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. When Paul was rejoicing in a prison in Rome, he was not deliberately trying to act joyful. His rejoicing was not the result of his own effort, and it certainly was not a performance. Because Paul loved the Triune God, opened himself to the Triune God, and communicated with the Triune God, He had a free course to infuse all that He is into Paul. As a result, Paul could realize that with this Triune God there is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Because he experienced this supply, he could rejoice in the Lord even while being a prisoner in chains.</p>
<p>When we fail to magnify Christ and are put to shame, this indicates that there is a shortage of Christ. However, the shortage is actually the lack of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we shall experience instant and constant salvation. Then we will not be put to shame in anything, but we will magnify Christ in all things.</p>
<p>When we find ourselves in a difficult environment, we simply need to apply the compound ointment, the compound Spirit. The compound Spirit is in our regenerated human spirit. Instead of considering our difficult environment, we should turn to the spirit, apply the compound Spirit, and behold the Lord with an unveiled face. Then we will reflect the Lord. If we apply the compound Spirit and behold the Lord, the elements of the ointment will be applied to us. Both the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ will operate in us, and we will be anointed with the compound Spirit. In this Spirit is all that we need&mdash;the death of Christ and its effectiveness, the resurrection of Christ and its power, and Christ&rsquo;s divine nature and human nature. By applying this compound Spirit, we will experience God&rsquo;s instant salvation. Then, far from being put to shame, we will magnify Christ. Furthermore, those with us will want to rejoice in the Lord when they see such a glorious magnification of Christ.</p>
<p>Through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, Christ is magnified in us. What Paul speaks of in Philippians 1:20 is the magnification of Christ, but in 2:16 he speaks of holding forth the word of life. The word of life is actually the living expression of Christ. Holding forth the word of life is equal to magnifying Christ. Christ Himself is the word of life. We hold forth the word of life, and this word is Christ.</p>
<p>In order to magnify Christ and to live Christ, we need the bountiful supply of the Spirit. This bountiful supply is stored in the word. According to the Bible, the Spirit and the word are one. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This indicates that the word is the Spirit. Ephesians 6:17-18 indicates that the Spirit is the word. Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed. Every word of the Bible is the breath of God. This breath is the <em>pneuma,</em> the Spirit. Thus, because both the word and the Spirit are the breath of God, they are truly one. The Spirit is the breath of God, and the word also is God&rsquo;s breath. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s breath is His <em>pneuma,</em> the Spirit. On the one hand, the word of God is the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit of God is the word.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 6:17 and 18 Paul tells us to receive the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition. Here Paul covers the aspects of the word and the Spirit. Furthermore, he tells us to receive the word of God by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit. We may receive the word of God by means of all kinds of prayer&mdash;audible and silent prayer, long and short prayer, quick and slow prayer, and private and public prayer. When we pray-read the word, we exercise our spirit. As saved and regenerated ones, we have the Spirit of God in our spirit. Thus, when we exercise our spirit in pray-reading the word, we apply the word to us and mingle the word and the Spirit. Immediately, we receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the fullness of the Godhead is embodied in Christ. This means that all the riches that God has and is are embodied in Christ. Having passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ is now the all-inclusive Spirit with the bountiful supply. The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in Philippians 1:19 is nothing less than the riches of Christ in Ephesians 3:8. Paul testifies that he was given grace to preach the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ. With respect to Christ, there are the unsearchable riches, but with respect to the Spirit, there is the bountiful supply.</p>
<p>It bears repeating that the bountiful supply of the Spirit is the unsearchable riches of Christ. Both the riches and the supply are embodied in the Word of God in the Bible. If we would touch the unsearchable riches of Christ and partake of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we must come to the Bible. God&rsquo;s intention is to impart Himself to us and work Himself into us. He does this by means of the Spirit and the Bible. By these means, the heavenly riches are transmitted into us. On our part, we need to turn away from trying to do good and taking the Bible merely as a book of ethics; instead, we need to come to the Bible for nourishment. We should not simply read the Bible and study it; we also need to pray-read it. If we desire to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we need to eat the word by pray-reading the Word (Jer. 15:16; Matt. 4:4).</p>
<p>Through reading the Word, we know what we are receiving in the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Through the Word we realize that we receive Christ&rsquo;s divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension. Furthermore, we understand that we are one with Christ in His headship, lordship, and kingship. All these elements are included in the compound Spirit; they all are aspects of the bountiful supply of the Spirit. We may now live Christ by receiving the word through the Spirit!</p>
<p>We simply need to come to the Bible, to the embodiment of the riches of Christ and of the bountiful supply of the Spirit. As we feed on the word in a proper way day by day, we will grow. The flesh, the natural man, the self, and different evil tendencies and intents will be dealt with. Furthermore, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life will release the divine riches into us, strengthen our spirit, and edify our whole being. Spontaneously, unconsciously, and automatically we will live Christ. Living Christ in this way is equal to holding forth the word of life. As we live Christ, having a daily life full of divinity, humanity, Christ&rsquo;s human living, death, and the fragrance of His resurrection, we will magnify Christ. This is what it means to live Christ by the riches of the bountiful supply of the Spirit embodied in the word.</p>
<p>When we enjoy the Spirit and partake of Him, Christ comes forth and is magnified. On the one hand, we enjoy the Spirit; on the other hand, Christ is the One who is magnified. This is true both according to the Bible and according to our experience. When we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we inwardly enjoy the Spirit. Then as a result of the enjoyment of the Spirit, Christ is magnified. He becomes our expression.</p></body></html>
