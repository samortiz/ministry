OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we confess that we are still corrupt; hence, we need the cleansing of Your precious blood. Lord, thank You that Your blood always cleanses us. By this precious blood we are kept in the Holy of Holies to fellowship with You. Lord, we are all willing to open to You; we pray that You would bring us into Yourself so that we may behold Your glorious face in the Holy of Holies. Visit us and touch our deepest part so that every one of us will bow our heads and worship You.</p>
<p>Lord, remove our defilement, our prejudices, and our traditional ways of thinking. Have mercy on us so that the veils on our hearts may fall away. Lord, open the heavens to us in these days. Be open to us, and may Your Word also be open to us. Open our spirit, and give us a clear mind to understand Your word and see Your move.</p>
<p>We pray that You would visit all the dear saints. You are the God who gains the victory over all men; You are the Lord of all men. O Lord Jesus, You are so rich to each of us; Your grace and riches are available to those who seek after You. Whoever calls upon Your name will enjoy You. Visit us now. We pray for all who seek after You. We look to You for Your blessing; make this moment a moment of blessing. Lord, we come before You and gather around Your Word. We really want to know You and Your way; may You clearly shine on us and guide us. In the name of the Lord we pray. Amen.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will begin to fellowship about specific practices related to the increase and spread of the church. The burden in these messages is mainly related to the increase and spread of the church. The matter of increase is related to a church locally, whereas the matter of spread involves the church&rsquo;s spreading out. The churches on earth should increase, and the church on the earth should spread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WITNESSES</h2>
<p>In the Chinese Union Version translation, Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,...you shall be My testimony...unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; However, in Greek this verse does not speak about being the Lord&rsquo;s testimony; rather, it speaks about being the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. There is a big difference between these two. In the translation of the Bible, many versions often make the mistake of overemphasizing tone and style while overlooking the meaning of the words in the original text. However, the Bible was written not as a book of literature but as a book of revelation.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul came from Tarsus, a large city well known for its learning, and he was trained at the feet of Gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people (5:34; 22:3). All the readers of the New Testament acknowledge Paul&rsquo;s writing skill. However, he did not sacrifice spiritual meaning for the sake of literary considerations. We are preparing a new translation of the Bible based on this principle. We may not have the highest literary attainments, but we will express the original meaning of the words in the New Testament to the best of our efforts.</p>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the word <em>witnesses</em> is the best translation of the word in the original text. This word literally means &ldquo;martyrs.&rdquo; This word does not refer to an objective testimony but to a group of persons who are martyrs. A martyr is a witness. God&rsquo;s divine truth in the New Testament was written originally in Greek. In our translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, we always try to follow the sense of the meaning in the original text. This is because we are trying to convey the divine truth of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECT OF THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES&mdash;<br />
THE PROPAGATION OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>The subject of Acts is &ldquo;The Propagation of the Resurrected Christ in His Ascension, by the Spirit, through the Disciples, for the Producing of the Churches&mdash;the Kingdom of God.&rdquo; In brief, the book of Acts speaks of &ldquo;the propagation of the resurrected Christ.&rdquo; This propagation involves the reproduction of Christ or, using printing terminology, the reprinting of Christ. In printing, there is always an original version that is printed in mass quantities. Every printed copy is the same as the original version; it is a reprint, a reproduction, of the original. This is the meaning of propagation.</p>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said that when a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit. In the propagation of many grains, every kernel of grain is the same as the original planted grain. The many grains are the propagation and increase of the original one grain. In the Gospels we can see such a wonderful One. He lived on the earth and then passed through death and resurrection. In His resurrection as the Spirit of life, He entered into those who believed into Him, and in His ascension He poured the economical Spirit upon His believing disciples. As a result, these disciples not only had Him within them as life but also upon them as power. As such, they were His propagation, His many grains.</p>
<p>As the propagation of the Lord Jesus, these disciples needed to propagate as well. On the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up with eleven disciples and gave a message, and as a result, three thousand people were led to salvation. These three thousand people were a mass propagation. This may be likened to a grain of wheat being planted and bearing thirty grains, which in turn are planted and produce a hundred grains each. Thus, all three thousand grains are the propagation of one initial grain.</p>
<p>Throughout the book of Acts there is a continual propagation. Chapter 1 speaks of the preparation for the propagation, and from chapter 2 onward there is a propagation that continues through the last chapter. Bible scholars and readers acknowledge that the book of Acts does not have an ending; it is continuing even now. If there were a written record of the continuing acts of the propagating disciples, we might have twenty-eight thousand chapters. Christ&rsquo;s propagation has never ceased, even though the record in Acts goes only to around A.D. 66. Christ&rsquo;s propagation did not stop with Paul. It went west from Asia Minor to Europe, south to Africa, and east to India. According to historical accounts, many believe that the apostle Thomas brought this propagation to India. When Columbus sailed west and discovered a new continent, this propagation came from Europe to America. Today the propagation of Christ has been extended throughout the earth.</p>
<p>In recent days methods of transportation and new ways of video and audio transmission are continually being improved, making the world seem smaller and smaller and more convenient for Christ&rsquo;s propagation. Consider the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery: A message given in a meeting can reach every continent on the earth in less than a week through video and sound recordings. In less than a month the messages can be translated into different languages and printed as books. All this is for Christ&rsquo;s propagation.</p>
<p>Acts is specifically on Christ&rsquo;s propagation; this propagation produces the churches. The churches are not only Christ&rsquo;s propagation but also God&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s propagation, the churches, and the kingdom of God are synonymous. Christ&rsquo;s propagation is Christ&rsquo;s increase; it is also the spread of Christ. Christ not only propagates, He spreads to the four corners of the earth. This increase and spread are the church, and the church is God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth today. The entire content of Acts is focused on the propagation, increase, and spread of Christ, which produce churches on earth in locality after locality, and these churches are the kingdom of God.</p>
