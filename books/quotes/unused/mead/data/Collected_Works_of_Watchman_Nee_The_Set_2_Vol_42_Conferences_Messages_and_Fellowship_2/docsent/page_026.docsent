   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE QUALIFICATION OF THE LORD'S WORKER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In southern Fukien, a few young brothers wanted to give up their jobs to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I asked them what they would say to others when they went out, what kind of Christ they would present to others, and what and how much Christ had done for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I asked them to tell me how much knowledge they had of Christ and what kind of knowledge it was.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may only know a few things about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may only know that Christ is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If this is all we know, we could say nothing more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is what we are, we are not qualified to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never think that we can teach others just because we have a smart mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Men lack life; they do not lack knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Men lack the Holy Spirit; they do not lack words of wisdom and persuasion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Men lack life and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only those who genuinely know Christ can enliven others, and only they can impart spirit and life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we may wonder who is qualified to be the Lord's worker, and what are the conditions for being one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Very often men think that as long as a person can speak well, can expound the Bible well, and has a clear mind, he can be a worker of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We think that these are the ones who can save others and be God's workers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, a real worker of the Lord does not rest his qualifications on eloquence or knowledge of Bible exposition but on his history and experience before the Lord and his knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not assume that as long as a man can preach and lead others to repentance he is qualified to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question is how much Christ we know.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we share what we have, how much do we have left?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We claim that we know Christ, but when the Christ we know is preached, how much of Him do we still have within us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am afraid that when many speak about what they know of Christ, nothing more is left within them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They have no Christ other than what they have released from the pulpit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a shallow life; this is not the testimony of one who knows Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt we know that Christ is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But other than that, what else do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have been working for the Lord for a long time and can only say one or two things about Him, we are not of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The knowledge of Christ as Savior is the minimum requirement of every Christian; it is not a special experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must advance farther and acquire experience that others have not acquired before we can lead others on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have a deep knowledge of the Lord, what use will all the Bible expositions serve?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One brother came to Shanghai and wanted to work for the Lord, but I sent him home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said to me once, "You have asked Brothers So-and-so he mentioned three names to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please give me an opportunity to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the three of them can do it, why can't I do it?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can speak just as well as they did."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said, "You are smarter than the three of them, and you preach well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are familiar with the Bible, and others like to listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But you lack one thing which they have they know a Christ whom you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have much experience, but you only have your experience of salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please remember that eloquence, the ability to preach, scriptural knowledge, and skill in Bible exposition alone is not enough to make a person a worker of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A worker of the Lord must have his foundation based on the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may be able to speak much, but such speaking is not a testimony for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A testimony for Christ is that which speaks to others the Christ whom you have known and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I know of a pastor in this area who preaches to others but has not experienced regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can speak to others about the doctrine of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He studied in a seminary and received much education in Bible teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He can tell others how a sinner can be saved, but he only wants theology; he does not want Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many churches invite him to preach, and he can deliver many good sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But let me ask: If he were speaking on the podium now and you were listening to him, what would you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may wish that he would be saved first.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His message may be good, but he cannot say that Christ is his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such a person is useless in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I cannot say that we are free from such danger among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is vain to merely preach the teaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to realize that knowing the cross of Christ is knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What man needs is not the doctrine of salvation, but salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What he needs is not the teaching of overcoming, but the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What he needs is not the teaching about meekness, but meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What he needs is not the teaching of Christ's resurrection and ascension, but the power of His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A man can preach about the filling of the Holy Spirit, self-discipline, and self-denial, but what is the real purpose of these teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people can only preach a doctrine, while others have the experience of what they are preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One is a theologian in a Christian institution, while the other is a witness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you can only deliver sermons, but cannot testify of Christ, you will not be of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Suppose a brother or sister from the countryside comes into our midst today.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He may not have much knowledge and may not be that clear in his logic; he may only know how to trust in the Lord and experience Him as his victory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In talking to him, we may have to help him in the doctrine or prophetic interpretation of the verses he quotes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may tell him about the doctrine of dispensationalism, the meaning of different words according to the original language, or the meaning of grace, the law, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But apart from all this knowledge, what experience do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What testimonies can we give?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Can we give such a good brother further instructions?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may tell him that when he prays he has to pray in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may tell him that he needs faith, or that he needs to confess his sins, but God may already have been answering his prayers five or ten times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We may know the teaching concerning prayer, but he may have more experience of prayer in a day than we have in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We think that we are qualified to be a worker and that he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We think that we can do this and that and he cannot, because we are qualified in so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, his spiritual insight before the Lord may be much deeper than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We know the teachings about Christ, but he knows the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The basis of our testimony for Christ is our knowledge of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Without a knowledge of Christ, we cannot be a witness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This does not mean that biblical teachings, ideas, and eloquence are bad and unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They are good and helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Nevertheless, our indispensable need is the knowledge of Christ; this is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It does not matter much if we cannot speak that clearly about the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What is important is the experience of the blood cleansing our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It does not matter much if we cannot speak about the teaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What is important is the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are witnesses of Christ; we are not teachers of doctrines about Christ.</S>
