   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STAYING IN GOD S DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can I say that the mountain in verse 17 refers to Mount Zion?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because that is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sanctuary that God dwells in is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, God made Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then God built and established the temple on Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mount Zion with the temple as God s sanctuary was the meeting place of all the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Three times every year they all had to go there, not just to have a visit, but even to stay, to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They dwelt there not just by themselves but with God for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Seven days in the Bible indicate a full course of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that for the full course of our human life we must stay in the gathering with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must stay in God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must stay in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE PLACE CHOSEN BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we need to read Deuteronomy 12:11: Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse refers to a place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God charged the children of Israel that after they entered into the good land, they should not come together at just any place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was only one place which was legitimate for them to gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was Mount Zion where God s temple was.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Three times every year they had to bring all their top produce from the land to that place for gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There they stayed together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was their meeting time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They met there every year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know that these are different aspects of one thing, that is, our today s gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our today s gathering should be like that.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>MEETING TO DO THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND FULFILL HIS PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we prove that to meet is to do the will of God and fulfill God s purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 73:16-17 says: When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. When the psalmist thought about certain matters, it was painful for him, but when he went into the sanctuary of God he began to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that in the past many of us were seeking after the Lord s will concerning our families, our marriage, our job, our school.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times it was painful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were seeking to know the will of God concerning these things, but it was painful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But a number of times when we just came into the meeting, the thing we were seeking to know became very clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The message didn t cover that particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No testimony referred to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We just came to the meeting and sat there and the clearness came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, many times the testimonies helped us to be clear, and even more times the message helped us to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But anyhow we all can testify that the best place and the best time for us to know God s will is when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not many have gotten to know the Lord s will quite often outside the meeting, but many have gotten to know the Lord s will quite often in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Too many times we prayed concerning things again and again, seeking to know the Lord s will, but we failed to get clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when we came to the meeting, it became so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To do the Lord s will firstly depends upon the knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you could know the Lord s will, the major part is accomplished already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come together, our intention may be to pray, to worship, to serve, to hear a message, to be taught, to be exhorted, to be strengthened, to be comforted, to be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, dear saints, with our meetings there are so many wonderful things underneath the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We gain a lot of benefits and profit that we do not realize by participating in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So this means we don t treasure the meeting as we should.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We don t appreciate the meeting as we should.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE MOST CRUCIAL THING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to realize today on this earth, besides our inner life, no other thing is so crucial, so important, so profitable as the matter of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Believe me!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day you will testify that to lose your job is not so important as to miss a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To miss a meeting means the real loss.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To lose your job doesn t mean some real loss.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I don t want to assure you in the way of superstition, but I would say that if you meet properly, the Lord would probably keep you in a job.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you meet properly like the children of Israel did and you don t have a job, then the Lord might send the manna to you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then you might say, If this is so, let us all quit our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We would take this hall as Mount Zion, and we would meet here every day and stay here daily.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is superstition.</S>
