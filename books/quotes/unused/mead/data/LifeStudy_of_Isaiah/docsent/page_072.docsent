   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Saying That They Have Waited for Their God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 25:9, in that day Israel will say, "Behold, this is our God;/We have waited that He may save us./This is Jehovah, for whom we have waited;/Let us be glad and rejoice in His salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Waiting for Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>in the Path of His Judgments</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Indeed, in the path of Your judgments,/O Jehovah, we have waited for You" 26:8a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that while the Lord is judging, we should wait for Him in the path of His judging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While the Lord is chastening us, we need to learn something of Him and find out the lesson that the Lord would give us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, some saints, after being chastened by the Lord, seem to learn nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They waste both their time and the Lord's chastening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever we are chastened by the Lord, we need to learn something of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is to wait for Him in the path of His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 8b and 9 continue, "Your name, that is, Your memorial,/Is the desire of our soul./My soul desires You in the night;/Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn;/For when Your judgments are in the earth,/The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's judgment always teaches us lessons in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 10 says, "Though the wicked is shown grace,/He does not learn righteousness;/In the land of the straight-forwardness he deals unjustly/And does not perceive the majesty of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes when God shows grace to us, we do not learn any lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So at times He has to be severe with us and chastise us that we may learn something of Him and perceive His majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Saying That Jehovah's Hand Is Lifted Up</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 26:11 Jehovah's hand is lifted up, but they do not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they will see Jehovah's zeal for the people and will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fire will devour His adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 12 and 13 Israel continues to pray, saying, "O Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us,/For You have also performed all our works for us./O Jehovah our God, other lords besides You have been master to us,/But through You alone do we mention Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though others would be lords over them, they do not mention their name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, they mention only the name of Jehovah, recognizing that He alone is their Master.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lifting Up Their Voice, Giving a Ringing Shout</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, in turning to Jehovah, Israel will lift up their voice; they will give a ringing shout 24:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the majesty of Jehovah, they will cry out from the west, from the sea v. 14b . Verses 15 and 16 go on to say, "Therefore in the east glorify Jehovah,/Even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the coastlands of the sea./From the ends of the earth we hear songs:/Glory to the righteous One!"</S>
