   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 THE CITY REPRESENTING THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our second major point is that this ultimate consummation of God's work is not only a tent, a tabernacle, but also a city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A tent is not very strong or permanent; but this tent is also a city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the scriptural meaning, a city is a center for the exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the city symbolizes the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Jerusalem is not only a tent as a dwelling-place; it is also a city as the center of a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the early stages of history there was a small tent; then came the tabernacle and eventually the temple; finally there will be a city, the strongest and most established structure of all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is difficult to visualize authority as symbolized by a tent, a tabernacle, or even a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But a city aptly symbolizes a center where authority is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the symbol of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The throne of God will be displayed in the New Jerusalem, for this city is the center of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The early chapters of the book of Revelation reveal God sitting on the throne apart from the city Rev 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the concluding chapters God is on the throne in the city Rev 21:5; 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This signifies that it is not until the New Jerusalem descends out of heaven at the end time that God will be enthroned in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is on the throne now, but at that time He will exercise His authority over a full kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church today must be the realm of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Apostle Paul speaks of this vital principle in his writings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 12 reveals the Body of Christ, but Romans 14 speaks of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The proper church life is a realm, a sphere, where God may exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Strictly speaking, the proper church life is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life must be like the holy city, the New Jerusalem, a center where God may exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3 THE CITY BUILT IN ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our third major point is that the New Jerusalem is a city built up in perfect order.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not just a heap of precious stones, but a city built up with precious stones Rev 21:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may possess many good materials which are ideal for building; however, if these materials are merely gathered in a pile, they certainly do not compose a building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even so, in the church life there must be the real building, not just a group of wonderful believers gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our first need is to be transformed into precious material; then we must be built up with others as a building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have the real building, the city will be manifested in order.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church life we must all be in a good order, not just heaped together as a pile of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I were to invite someone to my house, I would not take him to a lumberyard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I must bring him to a house which has been built up in good and proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be a proper church, we first need to be a building, and then we will be a city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4 THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fourth major point is that the New Jerusalem is the very tabernacle of God Rev 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tabernacle conveys three basic thoughts: that of dwelling, of rest, and of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church must be such a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It must be a place where God dwells, where God rests, and where God expresses Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>5 THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fifth point is that this city is also called the Bride Rev 21:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A bride portrays several main things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first bride, Eve, was a part of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She came out of Adam Gen 2:21-24 ; therefore, she was his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even so, the church must be a part of Christ Eph 5:30-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A bride also speaks of love and unity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The husband loves the bride, and the bride loves her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She is united in oneness with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such unity is not only a matter of love, but also a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Adam did not find his counterpart in any of the other living creatures, for none possessed a life which matched his own.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only Eve had the same life that Adam had.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church must firstly be something which is taken out of Christ; then it must be in a union of love with Christ; finally, it must possess the same life and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be a bride is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the bride must also be a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything is wonderful on the wedding day, but afterwards the bride must become the wife, and that is more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The New Jerusalem is not only the Bride, but also the Wife of Christ for all eternity.</S>
