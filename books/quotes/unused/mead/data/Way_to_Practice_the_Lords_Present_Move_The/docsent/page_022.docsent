   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRODUCE AND SUPPORT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a country, a nation, is going to be strong, it must produce and support an army.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not everyone goes to the battle, but some younger, strong, bolder, and daring ones have to be in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rest of us should do everything to support our army.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The full-timers may receive their support from the church or from individual saints, but they should take nothing from the Gentiles 3 John 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not be bothered that some full-timers might receive more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Remember that there is the principle of equality 2 Cor 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not keep the principle of equality, the Lord will keep it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not need to be bothered, though, because we have the living God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have the principle of equality working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we receive more, we should give more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you receive more, do not spend that much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My wife and I always practice to save something for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we give our money to the Lord for His move, it goes to our bank in heaven Matt 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is more blessed to give than to receive Acts 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An older brother in Taiwan who was over ninety years old had saved seventy-five thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he heard the news about our plan to build a training center at Lin-Ko, he decided to give this entire amount for that purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I thank the Lord that there are many stories like this in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not only think about your need; think about the Lord s need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we were building the meeting hall in Anaheim, California, I spent day after day in its design.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire hall, basically speaking, was designed by me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although I am a layman in civil engineering, I spent much time to design the stairways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>About eighty young people dedicated half a year to help build this hall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the building work was nearing completion, they told me they wanted to build a house for me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time, I was living in an apartment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While they were busy working on that house, I was still busy working on the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One late night, I went back to see the house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I saw many sisters there painting the walls, I was moved nearly to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was quite inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I did not care for my need but for the Lord s house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But He sent so many dear saints to build a house for me and take care of my need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They finished that house within eight weeks so my family could be moved in before the training.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One pair of doors in my house is uneven; one door is about one-eighth inch longer than the other, but I do not want to adjust it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I love those two doors because they were built by my dear brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In my bedroom the sliding doors of the closet do not fit the corner of the frame, but I will not let anyone adjust it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want to keep that as a souvenir of all the divine love the Lord has exercised over me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we were being moved in, I was still busy on the stairways in the Anaheim meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My testimony is this if you work for the Lord, He will take care of you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you receive more, do not keep it for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you receive more, give to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I also like to see my co-workers live well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they live poorly, I am unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not expect others to take care of your co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, all the co-workers need to give at least ten percent of their income to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that the more I give to the Lord, the more He gives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s loving care is within us, and this working principle of equality is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all should do our best to save money to spend on the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone should offer five percent of his income for the full-timers support and the church should put this into a separate account.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not mean that any of us should live poorly but that we should not live excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not live a life that exceeds the proper necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You know how much you should save and how much to be restricted in your spending.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord will lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should always have the thought of saving something for our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you can maintain a good living by nine hundred dollars, do not maintain it by one thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Save the extra one hundred dollars for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do not mean that you should not have any savings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must keep something for your children s education.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord does not want us to be foolish people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to keep a proper budget and we should do well in our job to take care of our wife and children properly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We still should have some surplus to offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are living in the United States, a very rich country.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord will bless us if we give to Him faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we would all practice giving in this way, many things could be done for the Lord, and He will have a free way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the elders need to fellowship with all the saints about these things and even promote them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Promote the infilling and the outward filling of the Holy Spirit with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Promote the preaching of the gospel and the teaching of the truth in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Promote the producing and the supporting of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do this every week.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are here for the Lord s propagation and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In one message I said, In Canada you brothers have to go back to make noise.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Don t let those people sleep so peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Give them an alarm clock.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Don t let them sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Wake them up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Wake them up.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord s recovery has been in Canada for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How many are there?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Just a small number.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some of the brothers from Canada went back and made a big poster of this statement and put it in their meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What I said to the Canadian brothers I say also to you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Elders, make some noise in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not let those people sleep so peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They have been sleeping too well.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Give them an alarm clock.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Wake them up!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Elders, wake yourselves up first and then wake up others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The churches in the Lord s recovery have been sleeping peacefully for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not sleep anymore but wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Go to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Go to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Rise up!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Go!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Lord needs the propagation and the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Go to teach and to preach any time and anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need an army.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We need bolder ones, stronger ones, who dare to die, to be full-timers to form an army.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The elders have many things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To produce full-timers is not an easy task or a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It needs a lot of work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The elders need to fellowship with all those who intend to go full-time to find out whether or not they are qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Is their education adequate?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Is their character proper?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Some dear saints who love the Lord have a poor character.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>They always do things loosely and always treat people carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They may think that Mark has twenty-eight chapters and that Matthew has sixteen chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When they are asked to turn to a particular book of the Bible, they may not know where it is located.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>They also may not possess the adequate spiritual vocabulary and utterance to preach the gospel and to teach the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The elders have been with the saints for years and should know everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We depend upon the elders to exercise their discernment to make a decision as to whether someone in their locality is qualified to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It depends upon that person s education, spiritual qualification, gifts, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Is he a person who can endure trials and suffer poverty?</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Paul said that he knew how to be abased and how to abound Phil 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>By His mercy, I have learned how to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I was poor for a long time, having gone through a long tunnel and a long night of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Now I have learned how to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>By His mercy, I have distributed much money in recent years.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>A full-timer should be a person who can endure suffering, suffer poverty, and withstand riches.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Anyone that cannot stand the test of riches is not qualified to be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If money comes to you and God becomes second to your money, you are not qualified to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I was happy to see that so many responded to the call for full-timers, but everyone must realize that there will be a proper sifting.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Not everyone who desires to be a full-timer should be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The producing of full-timers also involves moving in the Body as the one new man by fellowshipping locally and universally.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>One who becomes a full-timer will not pass a formal exam, but a spontaneous test through all the churches as to whether or not he is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>An army cannot be formed with loose people.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>A person must be trained and disciplined and his character must be built up; otherwise, he cannot be a soldier in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The people in the air force must be precise and accurate; otherwise, they will damage their aircraft.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This does not mean the elders should pour cold water on the ones who want to be full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>They need to stir up many to be full-time and promote the matter of being full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Then the elders need to have the proper fellowship to find out who is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Some may be what 2 Thessalonians calls busybodies 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>These ones should be encouraged to do a good and steady job for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Then they may be qualified to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The elders in each locality have to do this because they should know the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>They need to ask the ones who want to go full-time how much they read their Bible daily and how much of the Recovery Version text and notes they have read.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Based on the elders discernment, some of the saints should be told that the time is not right for them to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>You should not be disappointed if the brothers in your locality do not feel that you should be full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>It may be that one of the elders is very strict and that he would hardly give his approval to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>David was very much rejected and put down by Saul, but he was the real one God had anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>When the time was right, David was raised up by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>If you are the right person, you will be a full-timer even if the elders say no to you.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>This is the Lord s recovery and no one can manipulate or control anything.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>If you are the right person to be a full-timer and you cannot get through in your locality, you will get through in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The Body will vindicate you.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If the elders in your locality say no to you, just say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Remain happy to serve the Lord in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If your speaking in the meetings edifies, builds up, and saves people, even the angels will testify that you are the right one.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>The elders should do their best to promote the matter of being full-time and if possible to raise up some to be full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Then the elders need to train these saints in life and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>They can render the help concerning how to read the Word, how to pray-read the Word, how to enjoy the Lord and contact the Lord, how to pray, and how to live a life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The elders need to do something initially.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Then the leading co-workers surely will regard what the elders say.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>The crucial key and the hinge of the practice of the Lord s present move is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>How the elders will fulfill their duty will determine how the churches practice the Lord s present move.</S>
