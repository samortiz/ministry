         <h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Take the example of washing dishes. Sometimes I wash the dishes for my wife. But many times I have had the thought that I would like the young people to know what I am doing and to realize what a good example I am setting for them. This is the magnified self. I know that this is the attitude among many in the brothers&rsquo; houses. As you are washing dishes, you may say, &ldquo;Lord, You know that the others are not willing to do the dishes. But I am doing them, Lord, for Your sake.&rdquo; This is the ugly self expressed in the washing of dishes. When you wash the dishes and have no thought or feeling about it, that is an indication that the self is gone. It reveals that you are nothing in the matter of washing the dishes. But as long as we have some thought concerning ourselves in this matter, it is a clear sign that self is present. Not only is self present, it is nourished. After some have washed the dishes in such a way, they go into their room and pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that I was the only one to wash the dishes.&rdquo; This kind of giving thanks comes from the magnified self. If you wash the dishes in this way for several days, you will eventually become angry with those you are living with and no longer wash any dishes. This is an indication of how much we need the exercise of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF GOD</h2>
<p>What is sown in the Gospels grows in the Epistles and is harvested in Revelation. In the Epistles we have the excellent example of the Apostle Paul. In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&rdquo; It was by the grace of God that Paul was what he was, and by this grace he labored more than others. Grace is God as our enjoyment. When we put 1 Corinthians 15:10 together with certain verses from the book of Philippians, we see that grace is nothing less than the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit. Thus, in Philippians 1:19 Paul says, &ldquo;For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Gk.). This is the grace of God. The grace of God is the bountiful, exhaustless, unending supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Today this Spirit is within us. Therefore, Paul could say, &ldquo;I can do all things in him who empowers me&rdquo; (Phil. 4:13, Gk.). Here Paul seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I cannot do anything. But I can do all things through Him who empowers me. The One who empowers me is not in the heavens; He is within me. In Him, I can do all things.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORKING OUT OUR SALVATION</h2>
<p>In Philippians 2:12 Paul said, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; This is not eternal salvation, but the salvation of the soul, the salvation of the kingdom. It is the salvation to receive the reward and to enter into the joy of the Lord in the coming age. This salvation needs to be worked out by us, whereas the eternal salvation does not require our work. Regarding eternal salvation, we simply receive it and have it. But we need to work something out in order to have the salvation of the soul, the salvation that qualifies us to receive the reward of the kingdom. In ourselves we are not able to work out this salvation. But we have One in us who can work it out. This One is God Himself who is working within us both the willing and the working of His good pleasure (Phil. 2:13). God works in, and we work out. His inward working requires our willing cooperation. If we are willing to cooperate with Him, He will have the ground and the way to work within us so that we may work out our salvation. There is no need for us to strive or use our own effort to accomplish such a salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>As we all know, we must eat in order to have strength. The problem is not with the food, for the food has been prepared and is now in front of us. People may do many things for you, but no one can eat for you. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy He firstly saved us and then put us into the exercise of the kingdom. For this exercise, we need Christ and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Although this Spirit is present within all real believers, millions of Christians are not hungry. Therefore, we who are hungry and who are eating Christ must preach the gospel of the kingdom. We need to tell the saints that although they have been saved for eternity, they may nevertheless have a problem with the Lord at the time of His coming back to settle accounts. The Lord will examine our living, behavior, and work since our salvation. This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>The gospel of the kingdom has been completely buried by the enemy. Today we must sound the trumpet of this gospel. When the Lord comes back, He will establish His kingdom of righteousness. At that time He will give us either a positive reward or a negative reward according to our doings. These doings are related to three matters: the denying of the self, the taking up of the cross, and the losing of the soul. The way we deal with these three things will be the basis on which the Lord will settle accounts with us. Then He will decide whether we shall receive a positive reward or a negative one. As those who believe the Bible, we must recognize that such a judgment is coming.</p>
<p>The gospel of the kingdom is for the building of the church. Many Christians today, including some of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, may be ignorant or negligent of this. It is not sufficient to talk about spirituality. The question is whether or not we are taking Christ as our supply to deny the self, bear the cross, and lose our soul. The reward of the kingdom in the future is an incentive for the building of the church. It is also a warning regarding the building of the church. If we do not live a life that is crucified, resurrected, and overcoming, a life that denies the self, takes up the cross, and loses the soul, we must be warned of the danger of being disapproved.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
