The first concerns the law, the second concerns the Lord's redemption, and the third concerns man's salvation after death. There are a few problems associated with them: First, according to their 1887 statistics, they had 260,000 converts. By now they must have over a million. But their teaching says that the Bible only grants 144,000 to be the overcomers. Only these ones will be able to go to heaven. If this is the case, they cannot preach their gospel anymore because the more they preach the more their elect will be displaced. Second, they consider all those who make Sunday the Sabbath to be sealed by the beast. Third, they even say that the tribulation will not be seven years. Rather it will be seven plagues within a year. How absurd this is! Fourth, some of them even claim that they are the third angel who blows the trumpet in Revelation. Now we can see the confusion of the Judaizers' system. They take advantage of the deadness of Protestantism to gain power for themselves. On the one hand, they have the Ten Commandments on their chapel walls. On the other hand, they will not read the Bible. If they are willing to read the Bible, they will not understand the verses we present to them. They are trained in their own way. They will bring out many unrelated passages to argue with us. When we talk with them, we have to be clear. We must not be led away by them. It is better for new ones not to contact them at all. If we reject them, they will not come back again.</p><p>They act in the same principle as the Jews in Revelation 2 and 3. The Seventh-day Adventists can be considered Judaizers. It is very difficult to bring a Seventh-day Adventist to salvation. The more a person is of the devil, the harder it is for him to turn to the Lord. We get an uneasy feeling whenever we are around a Hindu. Men like Gandhi may love to talk about the truth of love, but this cannot cause them to be saved because their love is not the love of Christ. When we listen to them, something bothers us within. The same is true, if not more so, when we talk with the Judaizers. Their teachings are too far off from the truth. We have to protect the brothers and sisters from falling into this darkness. Their teachings are too dangerous. We should only speak such things to the new ones briefly. There is no need to enumerate the names of all the heretics and evil teachers. We know the seriousness of the danger, but the new ones do not know. We have to help them not to contact these teachings so that they will be spared from such troubles.</p><p>A hundred years ago when the Brethren were raised up, they refuted the teaching of the Judaizers in the course of shaking up the Protestants. The Brethren are very good at Bible exposition. They are also very knowledgeable about the Lord's second coming. The proper attitude towards the Judaizers is to touch them as little as possible. Protestantism has disregarded one thing in the Bible&mdash;the Lord's second coming, and the Judaizers seize this point and use it to confuse the church. Among the Brethren, there are sixteen different interpretations concerning Daniel 9 in regards to the Lord's coming. All of them are trustworthy interpretations. The Judaizers are simply talking nonsense when it comes to interpreting Daniel and Revelation. These two books are not that hard. If any brother is distracted by the Judaizers, we have to bear the responsibility. Their propaganda rests heavily on the fact that Protestants do not read their Bible and that they have something to say about the Lord's second coming. We have to help new ones know the errors of the Judaizers so that they will guard themselves against the wrong teachings.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_096.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_098.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 97</div><br></body></html>
