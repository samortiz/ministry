The first began in the latter part of May 1948 and ended in early October of the same year. The second began in August 1949 and ended at the beginning of the following year. The nature of both trainings was the same, and the content was similar, with some improvements in the second training over the first. Most of the messages released during these two trainings have been published in The Collected Works as separate volumes (e.g., Authority and Submission (Vol. 47), Messages for Building Up New Believers (Vols. 48&mdash;50), Church Affairs (Vol. 51), The Character of the Lord's Worker (Vol. 52), The Ministry of God's Word (Vol. 53), and How to Study the Bible and The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit (Vol. 54). These books have rendered great help to seekers of the Lord everywhere. In addition to the messages which were previously published as books, previously unreleased notes from these trainings have been made available. Notes from Brother K. H. Weigh, Mrs. Weigh (Lin I-tien), and Brother Chang Wu-cheng have been collected, compiled, and edited into this and the following volume of The Collected Works. Chapters One through Forty-four are from the first training, while Chapters Forty-five through Sixty are from the second training.</p><p>The supplementary notes in these two volumes include:</p><p>1) Four messages on the breaking of the outer man and the exercise of the spirit. These notes supplement the book The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit.</p><p>2) Twelve messages on authority and submission. These notes supplement the book Authority and Submission.</p><p>3) Several messages on the life of a worker, which relate to the series of messages entitled The Character of the Lord's Worker.</p><p>4) Additional lessons in the series Messages for Building Up New Believers.</p><p>Messages which do not belong to any existing series include:</p><p>1) Question-and-answer sessions during the trainings.</p><p>2) Trainings on ways to preach the gospel. This section is comprised of eight messages and one question-and-answer session. It deals in depth with the techniques of preaching the gospel. The brevity of the notes does not hide the preciousness of the points conveyed.</p><p>3) Miscellaneous messages. These include notes of some Lord's Day morning sermons during this period, special fellowship on the handling of finances, and other miscellaneous talks.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">AN INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST TERM OF THE KULING TRAINING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:May 24 and 25, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><h2 class="head1">AN OUTLINE OF THE LESSONS<br />FOR THE FIRST TERM OF THE KULING TRAINING</h2><p>1. Personal Life&mdash;Learning to be disciplined, restricted, and dealt with in one's personal life.</p><p>2. Listening&mdash;Learning to listen to others and learning to obey others absolutely.</p><p>3. On Being an Authority&mdash;Learning to represent the authority of the Head, that is, to be an authority to others.</p><p>4. Training in Gospel Preaching&mdash;Learning about the nature of the gospel and the techniques of preaching the gospel.</p><p>5. Edification of Young Believers&mdash;Learning first to be edified and then learning to edify young believers.</p><p>6. Spiritual Judgment&mdash;Learning to discern and judge in spirit the spiritual condition of others and to point out the way of deliverance.</p><p>7. Working with One's Own Hand&mdash;Not only giving oneself to prayer and the ministry of the word, but learning to do practical works and to handle practical affairs.</p><p>8. Management of Church Affairs&mdash;With all the complexities associated with church management, one has to learn to properly handle various aspects of church affairs. For example, one has to know how to handle small matters, such as writing a letter of recommendation.</p><p>9. Knowing Men&mdash;Learning to know men by the spiritual sense, not merely by the mind.</p><p>10. Studying the Bible&mdash;Unlocking the ways and the keys to the study of the Bible, as well as the ways to receive light and spiritual supply from it.</p><p>11. Serving God according to One's Ministry&mdash;Learning to serve God according to one's ministry.</p><p>12. Receiving Revelation&mdash;Learning to receive revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ABOVE TWELVE ITEMS<br />BEING DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES:</h2><p>1. Being Trained&mdash;in daily living, in obedience, in guidance, in matters related to the church, in ministry, in business affairs, in revelation, in judgment, and in spiritual senses.</p><p>2. Training Others&mdash;in the gospel, in taking care of new believers, and in the study of the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING IN THE PRINCIPLE OF 1 CORINTHIANS 14</h2><p>We meet according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14, which is the principle of the prophets' meeting. In the meeting of the church, a prophet should exercise discernment while others are prophesying, and all should learn from one another the proper way to prophesy. A prophet should not exercise just his personal ministry, but he should minister by coordinating with many others. A prophet should exercise his spiritual senses to discern whether or not a speaker is speaking God's revelation. This is the way to have our teaching, and this is the way to have the church's teaching.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN AND<br />THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:May 25, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR GOD'S SERVANTS<br />TO EXERCISE THEIR SPIRIT</h2><p>In speaking of the exercise of our senses, we are not talking about the senses in our emotion, but the senses in our spirit. First Corinthians 2 speaks of a kind of people whose spirit discerns all things. As God's children, we know things by our spirit. We all have a spirit. However, it is strange that many people cannot use their spirit; their spirit does not function. It would be terrible if all the lights in the city of Foochow refused to work when we needed them and worked when we did not need them. Perhaps three or five brothers among us can use their spirit. The rest only touch their spirit occasionally and accidentally. If we cannot use our spirit, we can only depend on our eloquence, our mental ability, and our cleverness. May the Lord have mercy on us and judge us when we work by our eloquence, mental ability, and cleverness.</p><p>The most fundamental thing for a worker to have is his spirit. If I work as a telegraph operator, I need one basic faculty&mdash;my ears. An operator cannot have a problem with his ears. In serving the Lord, we can have a problem with our ears, eyes, hands, feet, or mouth, but we can never have a problem with our spirit. Once we realize that we serve and worship God with our spirit, we should learn not to trust in our emotion or our strength. We should pray instead that the Lord would empower us to exercise our spirit. If you do this, we can send you away in peace, and the church can send you away in peace as well. We should not think that this is a simple matter. This demands our very life. Our entire being has to change. We have to tear down our theology and learn instead to exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Those who are able to exercise their spirit reap four benefits from their exercise. First, they are able to live before God. While they contact others with their spirit, they are able to keep themselves in God's presence at the same time. They do not have to turn back to God after they have contacted men. Second, those who exercise their spirit know men. Third, they can release the power that is within them. Ephesians 6:10 says, "Be empowered." This has nothing to do with praying for power to come upon us from on high. We have to be the ones who will to be empowered. When we want to be empowered, the power within us will be released. When we do not consciously will to be empowered, the power within us will not be released. When a man exercises his spirit, it is easy for his very being to flow out. His spirit is not gagged but instead flows out easily. This means that his entire being opens up to others easily. It is hard for some people to release their spirit because they have too many shells; their outer man is not broken. Fourth, it is easy for those who exercise their spirit to receive others' spirit. It is also easy for them to receive the Holy Spirit. It is easy for such ones to receive help from others because their spirit is open.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>How can we exercise our spirit? The spirit within us is released only to the extent that our outer man, that is, our mind, emotion, and will, is broken. Only then can we exercise our spirit. We have to learn a basic lesson from God&mdash;allowing Him to break our outer man. The Bible divides man into two parts, the outer man and the inner man. We have one more person than an unbeliever; we have an inner man. At the time of our regeneration, God begot this man within us. Today our inner man is surrounded by our outer man. When others touch us, they may touch our outer man or they may touch our inner man. There is a clear difference between shaking hands and shaking gloves. When some come to us, we touch their spirit, their inner man. When others come to us, we only touch their mind, emotion, and will, their outer man. Their spirit is altogether concealed by their strong mind, emotion, and will. This is like shaking hands with a person wearing gloves. We can only touch the gloves; we cannot touch the hands. An unsaved person does not have this distinction between the outer man and the inner man. The outer man and the inner man are not side by side. Rather, the inner man is wrapped within the outer man; one man is within the other.</p><p>Today man's need is the release of our inner man, that is, the release of our spirit. This is the only way men will receive supply from us. How then can the inner man be released? How can we separate the outer man from the inner man? How can the inner man not be "gloved-in" by the outer man? The Gospel of John says that except a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit (12:24). If those who follow the Lord would lose their soul-life, they would gain life. If our soul-life dies, we will minister life to others. Expressing life means the breaking of the outer shell and the release of the inner life. Today many people are living, but they are not enlivening. In other words, they cannot reproduce; they cannot impart life to others. Only those whose outer man is broken are able to release their inner man. We should not think that we can learn some teachings from Foochow and then go home to carry on a work for the Lord. That would be too cheap! If our outer man is not broken and there is not a free channel through it, our spirit will not be released, and we will never touch others' spirit. We also will not have a proper knowledge of men. Those whom we think are good are not necessarily good, and those whom we think are bad are not necessarily bad. If our outer man is not broken, we are like an insulator. When a wire is insulated with rubber, no electricity passes through, and light is not produced. No matter how hard we touch the outer man, we can never strike inward reality. This is like shaking a gloved hand; only the glove is touched. Those who are tried before the Lord and whose outer man is broken will be able to release their inner life; they will bear much fruit.</p><p>The breaking of the outer man involves the operation of the cross. But in what area does the cross apply its breaking? It is applied invariably to the strongest area of our life. Whatever the strongest area of our life is, that is the area where the cross operates. When a man hits the wall, his nose gets hurt first because his nose is the outstanding part of his body. It is hard to hide whatever stands out in a man. Once this strong area is broken and removed, it will be easy for one to touch the spirit. Brother T. Austin-Sparks is robust in his mind, calm in his emotion, and strong in his will. He is strong and steady. But when you touch him, you do not touch his mind, emotion, or will, but his spirit. Miss M. E. Barber was astute and quick, but one did not feel her astuteness or her natural quickness. These traits were broken in her. When we say that the outer man has to be broken, we do not mean that the outer shell has to be removed altogether. We merely mean that the outer shell has to crack, and there have to be gaps and openings. If the Lord does not secure gaps and openings in us, we will have no way to go on. It is impossible to put up a spiritual performance. What we need is genuine breaking.</p><p>Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the treasure in the earthen vessel. The earthen vessel does not need more paint or ornamentation; it only needs breaking. This is the only way for the treasure within to be made manifest. We do not have to act calm, godly, or gentle before God. All we have to do is to allow the inner man to come out. We only need to allow God's life to flow out. We may be very talkative, quick, or jovial. There is nothing wrong about this. But if our outer man is not broken, it will not do us any good even if we shut our mouth, remove our smile, and remain silent. Today it is not a matter of whether or not the glove is good, but whether it is torn. Many people have been Christians for years. Yet they do not yield to God's discipline, and God cannot get through with them. The Lord is doing one thing on earth today&mdash;He is buffeting our outer man daily. Many people are always dissatisfied with the fellowship and coordination they have with the brothers and sisters in the church. They criticize and complain that this is wrong and that is off. They think that they are the only ones who are right and that everyone else is wrong. They protect their outward shell. It is amazing that after the Lord has buffeted them daily through their environment, they still cannot get through. The more buffeting some people experience, the more they murmur. They maintain intact all the time. Such ones are altogether useless. If we are taking our own way all the time, how can we expect God to use us to become a blessing to others? Some people become rebellious as soon as they are put under some authority or are wounded a little. How can such ones become a supply to others?</p><p>In the Bible, Job was an example of endurance. But it was Jacob, who was greatly chastised, who received the greatest mercy. The more authority there is in the church, the more chastisement God's children will receive. Most of us are better than Jacob at birth, but none of us can match Jacob's end. He did not have a good start, but he did have a good ending. He had the worst possible beginning. He held on to his brother's heel in his mother's womb. From the time he was born, he struggled. But he became crystal clear towards the end of his life. Among all the men in the Old Testament, Jacob had the best death. Isaac lived in peace for the first half of his life, but he was a blind and deceived man when he was on his deathbed. Jacob's pathway, however, became brighter and brighter as he moved towards the end. Ultimately, he did not speak of his own wisdom but only of God's mercy. He received the most mercy, because he received more chastisement from God's hand than others.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF<br />THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>Let us now consider four results of the breaking of the outer man. These correspond to the four benefits of exercising the spirit which we spoke of earlier.</p><h2 class="head2">Living before God</h2><p>The first benefit of the breaking of the outer man is the ability to live before the Lord all the time. Some people cannot have God's presence all the time because they only live in the realm of the outer man. The outer man is wild and estranged from God. This is the reason it needs to continually turn back to God. A person whose outer man is not broken constantly lives in the outer man. His outer man can deliver a sermon, but as soon as he returns home, he collapses. He has to wait until the next day before he can turn back to God again. The trouble with those who live in their outer man is that they cannot apply themselves to menial tasks, they cannot sweep the floor or clean the window, without being distracted by the works themselves. They live in the outer man. When they try to turn back to God, they have to spend much time making the turn. They cannot put their hands on any work because they quickly get carried away by the work. Only when the outer man is separated from the inner man, that is, when the spirit and the soul are separated, will a man be able to live before God. An unbroken man cannot remain in God for very long because the inner man is constantly distracted by the outer man. If the outer man and the inner man are separated, no outward distraction will interfere with the inner man any longer. The degree of separation determines the extent of the distraction. Those whose soul and spirit are not separated find the distractions threatening to their inner man. But the distractions only touch the outer man for those whose soul and spirit are separated; their inner man is not affected at all.</p><p>James and John accompanied the Lord to Jerusalem. On the way they found the Samaritans rejecting the Lord. The two asked the Lord if He wanted them to send fire from heaven to consume the Samaritans. They were trying to follow the footsteps of Elijah. But the Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (Luke 9:55). Our spirit must be free from anxiety, anger, or temper. If our spirit is touched by these things, we will not be able to remain in God. This will present a problem to us, and we will know that our inner man and outer man have not been separated. God's children should not remain in this condition.</p><p>Some people go to the extreme of stopping all outward activities in an attempt to preserve God's presence. But this is not the breaking of the outer man. It merely hides the outer man; it is the exercise of a hermit. A man may shy away from society and shut himself up and recoil from all outward activities, but this does not result in the breaking of his outer man; he is still very much intact. Such a person can only live a life behind closed doors.</p><p>Those whose outer man is broken will not find their inner man being drawn away when they speak with others. Even if they are very busy, their inner man will not be disturbed. Even if they have not prayed for twelve hours, they will not need to turn back to God. It does not matter whether or not they retain God in their memory; they do not need to turn back to Him. They are the same whether they are working, reading the Bible, or praying. Their outer man and inner man have been separated one from the other. Outward things only touch their outer man; their inner man remains hidden within. They can keep themselves occupied for twenty-four hours a day and not lose their inward composure. When they work, only the outer man is working; the inner man is not touched. They can rebuke others in a severe way for two hours without needing to turn back to God afterwards. Their inner man is not drawn out; it continually remains in God. It is possible to be angry and not sin. The Lord was angry in the temple; His anger was a measured anger. This anger stayed in the outer realm; it did not touch His inward being. The Bible says that we should not let the sun go down on our indignation. This indignation is a measured indignation. Only those whose soul is separated from their spirit can exercise this kind of measured indignation. It is wrong when both the rebuked and the rebuking one have to make confession afterwards. However, a man has to make confession for doing something as good as preaching the gospel if he does it in the outer man.</p><p>The problem with God's children today is that their inner man is not strong enough and their outer man is not broken. It is useless for a man to deal with outward things without first dealing with the outer man. It is vain to try to separate oneself from the outward things without first separating himself from the outer man. A man must allow his outer man to break. Some people are like sun-baked mud; the more they are exposed to the sun, the harder they become. The more they are disciplined, the more stubborn they become. Such ones are useless. Revival means that God has a way through man. The more some people are touched, the harder and angrier they become. We should be like a wax candle. As soon as the sun shines on us, we should melt. We need to be dealt with. We are not those who seek outward exaltation; we are those who seek breaking. No matter how old or young we are, the more pliable we are, the more fragrance we have. For years God has been working on us with only one purpose in mind&mdash;to break us. We should not think that we can take any shortcut. We cannot be an unbridled Christian. We must accept the dealings, the breaking, before our inner man can be released.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN AND<br />THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:May 26, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><h2 class="head2">The Ability to Know Men</h2><h2 class="head3">Touching Spirit with Spirit</h2><p>The second result of the breaking of the outer man is that one begins to know men. It is very important for a worker to know men. When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition; we have to know where his problem lies. If we do not know men or their spiritual condition, we will not be able to render them any help. A doctor needs many instruments to diagnose a patient. Even with many instruments, he sometimes cannot determine the illness of his patient. When a person comes to us, he may not tell us everything that is within him. A sinner often does not tell the truth, and believers often skip important things that we need to know. It is impossible to know men simply by their words. We cannot know a person simply by our ears or our eyes. Only those whose soul and spirit are separated and who are able to exercise their spirit can know men. This is a very basic principle in our work. We know men by the spirit, because the spirit discerns all things. We must learn to know others' spirit with our spirit. We must learn to sense their spirit with our spirit. We measure a person not by the words he speaks but by our spirit. We touch others' spirit with our spirit. This is what it means for deep to call unto deep and for deep to respond to deep.</p><p>In order for the senses in our spirit to be acute, the outer man must be broken. Every saved person should be inwardly clear about everything. If he is not clear, it is because his outer man has choked the way. We know a person's spirit by his words. As such, we have to touch the spirit behind a person's word. We do not know men just by our ears or eyes; we know their spirit with our spirit. However, their spirit follows their words. Hence, we have to touch the spirit behind the words. A proud person sooner or later will betray a proud spirit. He may say many humble things with his mouth, but others will touch his proud spirit sooner or later. What he says at the beginning is merely a kind of imitation or performance. His last few words determine his true condition. We have to touch others' spirit with our spirit. This is the only way to know their true condition.</p><h2 class="head3">Identifying Artificiality and Falsehood</h2><p>The only parts of man that can be improved are his thoughts and attitudes; a man cannot change his spirit. Young brothers should be as simple as possible; they should not be pretentious in any way. No pretense has any spiritual worth. Some young people are very flippant; others are very solemn. Both the flippant and the solemn ones are off the mark. There is a brother in Shanghai who was saved only a year ago, but he is neither flippant nor solemn. This is good. No outward embellishment will do us any good. If a man's spirit has learned the proper lessons before the Lord, others can tell the difference as soon as he opens his mouth. In order for a Christian to advance, he has to break down all outward, artificial humility, calmness, and godliness. He can deceive those in degraded Christianity, but he cannot deceive us. We should never pretend.</p><p>May the Lord have mercy on us. When God breaks us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit and purges our emotion and destroys our stubborn will through the environment, we will be built up spiritually. Then we will touch others' spirit and come to know other men. The problem with the young people is that they seek to build up their behavior instead of their spirituality. All outward things will be destroyed one day. It is possible to lie not only with our words but with our behavior as well. Job was upright in everything and eschewed evil. But he eventually repented of his own righteousness. Before the Lord we have to be genuine. We should not pretend or perform in any way.</p><p>First, we have to realize that we maintain God's presence by separating the outer man from the inner man. Second, through the separation of the outer man from the inner man, we also acquire a knowledge of men. We come to know men only after our outer man and inner man have been separated. We cannot know men with the outer man. Once our outer man is separated from our inner man, we are ready to listen to others and to touch their spirit. As a result, we will discern any falsehood in others. Anything artificial is false and deceptive.</p><h2 class="head3">Acknowledging God's Disciplining Hand</h2><p>How do we separate the soul from the spirit? We do not have to do anything to separate them. The work of separation is in God's hand. God arranges for us to experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit through our environment for the purpose of breaking us and separating our soul from our spirit. For seven or eight years I did not have fellowship with others. There was not much light from God and I did not see many people. Yet I must say that I was not short of the discipline of the Holy Spirit during this time. Sickness, poverty, and adversity are all different forms of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. They are for the purpose of breaking our outer man. However, if we are not open to these lessons, the Holy Spirit will not accomplish anything in us. Every day the Spirit is looking for the opportunity to break us. This is our spiritual pathway. One main proclamation in the New Testament is, "Heaven was opened" (Luke 3:21). God has opened all the spiritual principles to us. This is not a closed age. This is an open age. Once we see the spiritual principles, we will find that the spiritual pathway is an easy race.</p><p>Everything depends on God's work and the Spirit's discipline. If God is merciful to us, we will advance with the proper speed. Our prayer should be tempered in its earnestness. This means that we should neither be too earnest nor too lax. No one knows just what constitutes being tempered. We can only cast ourselves on God. If we act by ourselves, we will face frustration whether we turn left or right; we will be wrong whether we try to do too much or too little. The spiritual race has nothing to do with running or not running. It has nothing to do with willing or not willing. Everything hinges on God's mercy. Human wisdom is useless. If God is merciful to us, everything we do will be proper and right. Man's head is a sixth of his overall size. If it were a quarter of his overall size, he would be a monster. We cannot go overboard in anything, nor can we come short in anything. Those with a strong emotion must be matched by a strong spirit. It is terrible for a weak spirit to be accompanied by a strong emotion. Every part of our being has to be well- balanced. Yet we cannot balance the parts ourselves. When the Lord gives us a blow, we will be left with the proper sense of balance. On the one hand, we will feel that we want to go on, and on the other hand, that we cannot go on. If we pursue anything in ourselves, we will never attain this proper and optimum balance. This way is truly a way of crucifixion, yet it is the quickest way. Everything depends on our consecration to God. We should neither will nor struggle; we should look only to God's mercy. God will work on us according to His own will, and our outer man will be separated from our inner man.</p><h2 class="head3">Knowing Man's Spirit</h2><p>Ordinarily speaking, man's spirit is released through his speaking. In listening to others, we have to learn to remain quiet and calm. Do not concentrate on what is being said concerning their sins, holiness, goodness, evil, or their being right or wrong. Neither try to dig into the background of their stories. Instead, try to find out the condition of their spirit. When some speak, they may have the facts right but their spirit is wrong. In serving others, we are not interested in right and wrong. We do not judge who is right and who is wrong. We should only find out whether or not a person's spirit is right. A man may have done the right things with a wrong spirit. If a man's spirit is wrong, everything about him is wrong. We are here to render help to our brother's spirit, not to his business. We are here for the rightness of the spirit, not the rightness of facts. First and foremost, the Lord cares for our spirit. Only after this does He care for other things.</p><p>Once, the Lord was on His way to Jerusalem. Realizing that the Samaritans did not receive Him, James and John asked the Lord, "Do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" (Luke 9:54). As soon as they spoke this word, their spirit was exposed. They were right as far as the fact was concerned. They were doing this for the Lord, and they were scriptural in what they did. But the Lord told them, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are." Their spirit was wrong. The Lord was showing us that in listening to others, we should pay attention not only to the rightness of the outward appearance but also to the condition of the spirit. As soon as a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed. Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks. Once the spirit veers off, we have to repent to God and ask for forgiveness. Even if the facts are completely right, we still have to ask if we need to repent to God. If there is the need for repentance, it means that something is wrong. God judges us according to our spirit. If our spirit is wrong, everything else is wrong.</p><p>When a troubled brother or sister comes to us, we have to discover his or her spirit. While we are listening, we have to stop our mind and emotion, listen calmly, and wait for his or her spirit to come out. We have to give others' spirit the chance to flow out. We have to touch others' spirit aggressively with our spirit. Men often set their eyes on the rightness of a matter, but we have to set our eyes on the rightness of the spirit. We should go after the spirit and not after things. We have to listen carefully in order to touch men's spirit. Although everyone has ears, many do not have the ability to listen. If a person has a problem with listening, he has a problem with touching others' spirit. We can only touch others' spirit through listening to their words. A brother who is good at boxing may want to engage others in boxing to find out how good they are. We should do the same with our spirit; we should engage others' spirit. We should be able to measure their spirit. Only those who are able to measure others' spirit effectively are qualified to be good servants of the Lord.</p><p>In order to sense others' spirit, we have to listen to their words. We have to listen calmly and wait for the spirit to come out. God's Word says that the mouth speaks out of the fullness of the heart. A man can have many motives in his heart and use many ploys to cover himself, but his mouth will always say the things that are filling his heart. A man's speaking will always expose the condition of his spirit. If he is haughty, his speaking will always convey a spirit of haughtiness. If he is pretentious, his speaking will always convey a spirit of pretension. Once we hear a man speak, we can touch his spirit. Men often pay attention to the rightness of facts, but we have to pay attention to the rightness of the spirit. On the one hand, we have to ask God to deal with our spirit. On the other hand, we have to learn to listen quietly when others speak. We have to drop everything and focus on the spirit. Some people have a specious spirit, and we cannot deal with them gently. We have to deal with them sternly. Let me give you an example of a sister in Shanghai. We knew that she was proud because she liked to talk, and it was hard for her to listen to others. It was easy to know the condition of her spirit. Once a respectable man asked her for some help. She answered, "I have to seek God's will in this matter. I act solely according to His word. If this matter is not according to God's will, I will not do it even if you beg me on your knees. I have to obey God's word." This word exposed her spirit. She had an arrogant spirit. The first part of her reply could have been right, but the last part of her reply exposed her spirit. A man's spirit will eventually come out through his speaking.</p><h2 class="head3">Cultivating Others' Spirit</h2><p>At the beginning of my service to the Lord, Brother Leland Wang and I were together much of the time. He and I always argued with each other. There are many stories about the two of us. Today after so many years, I can speak of some of these things with few personal feelings. At that time I was seventeen or eighteen years old. We visited Miss M. E. Barber quite often. Whenever I went to her, I accused Leland. This occurred forty or fifty times. Miss Barber did not agree with me once. One time I went with many proofs of Leland's mistakes. Even Leland's wife persuaded him to stay away from Miss Barber at White Teeth Lake because she realized that Leland was wrong. But after I told Miss Barber everything, she still insisted that I was wrong. Although the things she said were not true, in the end I had to say that she was right. I was right according to the standard of outward conduct, but I was wrong in my inner man.</p><p>The three years that I spent at White Teeth Lake were very profitable times of training for me. Once, someone was ready for baptism. Among three brothers, I was the youngest. Leland was two years older than me, and the other one, Brother Wu, was seven years older than Leland. I was told by Miss Barber that I had to listen to Leland because he was two years older than me. I thought that Leland should surely listen to the brother who was seven years older than him, but he did not. I became indignant and complained. I felt that there was no justice in this whole episode. I went to Miss Barber to point out Leland's mistake. For half an hour to an hour I was filled with righteous indignation. I was young and could not contain my fleshly indignation. I kept talking for a long time. Eventually, Miss Barber said, "For the past few months, you have been coming to me to complain about Leland's mistakes. What if I were to say that Leland was wrong? What good would that do you? Are you here to fight for your right or are you here to bear the cross?" After a minute of silence she spoke again, saying, "Look at you! Is this the attitude of the Lamb?" She then spoke to me loudly and called me by my name: "Watchman Nee! Is this the way to bear the cross?" Immediately, I began to cry. I was crushed. From that day onward, I dared not accuse anyone. I feel that I owe this sister quite much. Today I do not have such an opportunity to learn such precious lessons. Although I suffered much under her hand, those dealings were a great blessing to me.</p><p>Brothers, this is the way our work must take. It is not a matter of dealing with right and wrong but a matter of dealing with others' spirit. Miss Barber was not a person in the realm of right and wrong. She was able to discern my whole being. Outwardly speaking, I was angry with her, but my inner man was subdued by her. In working for the Lord, we should not busy ourselves with reasoning, arguments, right, wrong, good, or evil. We are here to know men's spirit, to touch their spirit, and to cultivate their spirit. This is the lesson that we have to learn.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN AND THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Morning, May 27, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><h2 class="head2">The Release of the Spirit</h2><h2 class="head3">The Release of the Spirit Being<br />the Release of Power</h2><p>The third result of the breaking of the outer man is the ability to release one's spirit, which is the same as the ability to release the power within. We do not work by dispensing doctrines and theology to others, but by touching others with spirit. Our work is not based on our knowledge, theology, doctrine, or reason but our spirit. Once our outer man is broken, it is easy for our spirit to be released. The release of our spirit is the release of our power. Once our spirit reaches out and touches others' spirits, there is ministration and edification. If a man releases his spirit, yet his spirit does not touch others' spirits, it will return like the dove that was sent out from Noah's ark. The dove did not find a place to rest, and it was forced to return to the ark. The release of the spirit also brings in the inward operation of the Holy Spirit within us for others. The gift of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was brought in through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It was based on Christ's work on the cross. But the power of the Holy Spirit is not manifested only in His outpouring. Another aspect of the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested from within man and is expressed in service. Actually, this is the proper source of power. The goal of our work is to release our spirit within us. When our spirit is released, the Holy Spirit within us is released as well.</p><p>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit abides in man. Man's spirit is the habitation of the Holy Spirit. Bible translators have conflicting opinions on how to translate the many occurrences of the word spirit. They cannot agree on whether the word should be upper case (for the Holy Spirit) or lower case (for the human spirit). In many instances the word can refer either to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. It is hard to say what the various instances of the word spirit in Romans 8 refer to, whether they refer to the human spirit or the divine Spirit. Even Paul did not bother to make the distinction when he wrote his letter. In a regenerated person it is hard to separate the human spirit from the divine Spirit. It is useless to try to separate them artificially. God is pleased to mingle His Spirit with our spirit. There is no difference between our spirit and the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit works, the human spirit works. The power of the Holy Spirit is the power of the human spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">Supplying Others</h2><p>Our spirit is our inner man, and our inner man is often surrounded, boxed in, and encircled by the outer man. As a result, the power of the Holy Spirit cannot be released. Our own emotions, feelings, peculiarities, ideas, and wisdom are obstacles; they prevent the inner man from being released. Unless our outer man is broken, our inner man will not be released. Speaking for God involves the release of the inner man. The ministry of the word is the release of the spirit within and an outflow of life to others. A servant of God faces a basic frustration when his inner man cannot break through his outer man. Our outer man must be broken before the inner man can pass through. Once a man opens his mouth, we can tell whether or not he is broken. It is a joy to see men who have been fully tried by God. Those who have passed through God's dealings and have been tried in many ways will surely have wounds and scars; there will be a trail of blood following them. The Holy Spirit will have a free way through them, and it will be easy for them to release their spirit. Some people, however, only give others an impression of their mind, emotion, eloquence, and wisdom when they open their mouth. When they speak, one only hears words. Their words are like a gust of wind which sweeps across one's face, leaving nothing behind. A man who has been broken by God, however, can release his spirit easily. Those who listen to him receive spiritual supply from him. Some people go around in circles in their conversation; their words revolve around their mind, and their spirit is never released. These ones can only boast of their great mind; their spirit is never released, and they cannot render any help to others.</p><h2 class="head3">Fulfilling the Ministry of the Word</h2><p>What is the ministry of the word? Peter said, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word" (Acts 6:4). Peter's words indicate that everyone has a ministry, and that the apostles were committed to fulfill the ministry of the word. The phrase the ministry of the word in Greek is diakonia tou logou. It means a service. A ministry is a service; it means to wait on others. We should serve men with words. The ministry of the word is to serve men, to attend to their needs, with God's word. A minister of the word first must have the word. If he does not have the word, he cannot fulfill his ministry or attend to others' needs. How can one attend to others' needs by fulfilling the ministry of the word? When a man has the ministry of the word, he receives a revelation and a burden in his spirit. He is clear within about the Lord's will, the Lord's commission, and the Lord's word. He knows how to release this word. In the books of the prophets in the Old Testament, the word inspiration should be translated as "the burden of the word." In other words, once a person has a burden, he has inspiration. Without a burden, there cannot be any inspiration. A minister of the word first must have a burden for the word before he can step onto the platform.</p><p>It is not hard for a man to have a burden, but whether or not his outer man is broken is altogether a different matter. Sometimes a man has a definite burden and sense from the Lord, but his outer man cannot furnish him with the proper utterance. This happens to those whose outer man is not broken. Those whose outer man is not broken cannot speak to relieve their burden. Sometimes, their burden becomes heavier by speaking. If a man is broken, his inner man will be released. Sometimes a person stands on the podium and goes around in circles in his speaking. He is bound by his burden; he cannot release or discharge it. The burden inside his spirit cannot break through his outer man. Outwardly he may be preaching, but inwardly his burden is still within his spirit. His mind is not under his control, and he cannot discharge his inner burden through his speaking. He may speak for two hours, tiring out the audience as well as himself. He may use many words, but his spirit is not released. He comes to the meeting with a burden, and he returns home with the same burden. The load on his shoulder remains the same. If part of our outer man, the mind, is not broken, we will be useless to God. I am not saying that we should not exercise our mind. I am saying that the mind and the soul have to be servants to the spirit. The soul must be dealt with and smitten before it can become useful to the Lord. Only then is our mind no longer its own master but an instrument of the spirit.</p><p>A minister of the word must not only have a burden and a word from the Lord; his mind must be dealt with. If his mind has been dealt with, he can listen to others. He is not independent, and he can easily convey the burden of his spirit to others. When the word is released this way, the burden is released. One must not be satisfied simply with others' approval of his speaking; he must have the sense that he has spoken the right thing. If he speaks in this way, his burden will be discharged as soon as he finishes speaking. The audience will be satisfied, and he will be satisfied as well. The two worst conditions facing a minister of the word are: 1) Having thoughts but not being able to release the spirit in his ministry, that is, the spirit is not exercised, and 2) having the spirit and the exercise of the spirit in the ministry, but not having the proper thoughts. Both cases speak of a conflict between the outer man and the inner man. In neither case is there a proper ministry of the word. The first kind of ministers are heady and full of thoughts; they are blind in their mind. The second kind of ministers have a burden in their spirit, but they do not have the words to release them. Their outer man and inner man are in conflict with one another; they are not in harmony. Only a broken man can fulfill the ministry of the word and release his spirit quickly without going around in circles. As soon as his spirit is released, it touches others. If a man does not have an inward burden, he cannot fulfill the ministry of the word. If he has a burden but his outward thoughts do not cooperate with him, he cannot fulfill the ministry of the word either. Only those whose outer man has been smitten and broken by God can be proper ministers of the word. The ministry of the word means a ministry that discharges one's inward burden.</p><h2 class="head3">Conditions after the Breaking of the Outer Man</h2><h2 class="head4">The Will Being Pliable yet Strong</h2><p>After a man experiences the breaking of his outer shell, several things happen. First, the will becomes pliable. The will occupies a great part of the outer man. Once the outer man is broken, the person, the will, becomes softened. Before a man's shell is broken, he is hard. Those with an uncracked shell have a will that is hard but not powerful. A broken man, however, is a softened man. His will is strong but not hard. His will is like a tire which is strong but not hard. Those who want help find that it is easy to approach such a person. Such a person sees light easily. It is easy to approach such a person, and it is easy for him to approach others. Those whose outer man is broken and whose will is made pliable are very approachable for help, and it is also easy for them to receive help. They know men, and they are easy to get along with. It is easy for them to release their spirit and easy for them to receive God's word. We can talk to some people for two hours and yet still be in the dark about everything. We can talk with others for two minutes and all of our problems are solved. Those whose outer man is not broken have a hardened will. They like to argue, and they become quite rigid in their mentality. It is not easy for them to receive light or teaching from God. The first thing that happens with the breaking of the outer man is a softening of the will. This is not a mere form of politeness. Such softening is useless. The kind of softening that is manifested in a broken man is very spontaneous.</p><h2 class="head4">Easy for the Emotion to Be Touched<br />and to Express Itself</h2><p>Second, the emotions of those who are broken in their outer man are subdued. It is easy for their spirit to break out in weeping, and easy for it to break out in rejoicing. Emotions occupy a great part of a person's outer man. After the outer man is broken, the emotion becomes obedient. A man can weep and laugh without putting up much resistance. The distance between his spirit and the outside world becomes very short. Those who find it difficult to express sentiments are unbroken. When God created the universe, He exclaimed that everything was good even on the first day. He is full of feelings. Some people, however, are like rocks when they hear others talk; they are void of feelings. This is because their emotion is not broken. As a result, they cannot use their spirit. A person whose emotion is broken is easily touched by many things. He also can easily express himself. His emotions express themselves instantly, quickly, congenially, and easily.</p><h2 class="head4">The Mind Being Calm and Available</h2><p>Third, the mind of a broken person is subdued as well. Originally, a man's mind is centered around himself. When the outer man is unbroken, the mind tends to revolve around itself, and the spirit cannot make use of it. Under normal circumstances, when the outer man is broken, the mind will facilitate the release of the spirit. The mind is merely an instrument; it should always remain calm and be under the spirit's control. When the spirit has a burden, the mind should find the words to discharge the burden. A broken man is always ready in his mind; his mind is always ready to cooperate with the spirit. When something happens to him, he does not turn to his mind, but to his spirit. Only after he has exercised his spirit will he use his mind to deal with the matter. His mind is a servant, an instrument, that has been made available to the spirit's employ.</p><h2 class="head4">Easy for the Spirit to Be Released</h2><p>After the faculties in our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;are broken, we have a share in the work, and we have the ministry of the word. A man who is dealt with by God has a proper word within and adequate thoughts without. His various sentiments are expressed in a proper way, and he has a pliable yet strong will. When these things are in place, he has no trouble releasing his spirit. When the spirit within needs to be released, his outer man obeys. He speaks when he needs to speak, laughs when he needs to laugh, weeps when he needs to weep, and makes decisions when he needs to make decisions. In whatever his inner man wants to do, his outer man cooperates. In this way he becomes a minister of the word.</p><p>We fellowship with God with our spirit, and we also fellowship with the brothers and sisters with our spirit. God is Spirit, and as Spirit, He is omnipresent. Man also has a spirit, and he fellowships with God with his spirit. A man can fellowship with God with his spirit. However, the shell outside his spirit, his outer man, can prevent him from loving God and communicating with Him. Only those whose outer man is broken can release their spirit easily. Only they can fellowship with God and approach God in an intimate way. A person whose outer man is broken is very approachable to men, but those whose outer man is not broken have a constant barrier between them and others. The greatest hindrance to our spirit's fellowship, both with God and with man, is the outer man. Do we not feel the resistance the outer man gives to us? Sometimes we feel that it is hard to speak something to certain people. We know that something is wrong and that we should say something. But we dare not say it. Perhaps there is resistance in the other party, but often the resistance is with ourselves. We have a shell around us, and we cannot push our spirit out. We are too aloof. We cannot approach men. Perhaps others are waiting for us to say a word to them. Yet our spirit is clogged up; it cannot speak. Once our outer man is broken, we become approachable. Once the outer man is broken, all the barriers between us and others are removed. It becomes easy for us to reach the outside world, and it is easy to release the power within us.</p><p>God's work is not in the principle of removing the "glove" but in the principle of breaking the "glove." This is the way for the hand to come out and be exposed. This is how the cross deals with the outer man. This is also how the spirit becomes approachable to men. God is Spirit. There is no shell with Him. This is the reason He is so approachable to everyone. Once a man's outer shell is broken, he becomes very approachable to others, and the power within him comes out easily. When spiritual power is released, the distance between men is shortened, and there is no need to go through many steps for the spirit to be released. Such a person is transparent; there is nothing in his outer man that resists his spirit. Only such a one is qualified to work for God. If a man is broken by God and his spirit is free to contact men, any subsequent resistance is not from him but from others. A broken man can release his spirit in an instant. If he is smitten by God in a deep way, he can release his spirit quite readily. He does not have to pray to release his spirit. He can release it anywhere and at any time. This is the secret of God's ministry today. It is a ministry that basically issues from within. It has nothing to do with man's work, but with God's own work within man.</p><p>The fundamental experience of a minister of the word is the breaking of his outer man. The Spirit's operation can be seen every day, everywhere, and at any time. He is breaking our outer man continually. God's life is powerful within us, but we must be broken before this power can be released. The Spirit is working all the time. It is foolish to look for discipline from the Holy Spirit. We only need to submit to it and to give ourselves to God's breaking. The outer man must be separated from the inner man. Once the two are separated, the spirit can be released at will.</p><p>If our outer man is not broken and its growth is unchecked, great havoc will be done to the Body of Christ. The wanton growth of the outer man is like the invasion of cancerous cells in the body. When a man cuts himself by accident, cells around the wound grow and quickly seal up the wound. But if the cells continue to grow after the wound is healed, this inordinate growth becomes a cancerous growth. Cancer occurs when some cells break away from the normal law of the body and grow independently. They become a center to themselves and refuse to stop. Such cells are completely out of control. There is no way to deal with them except to cut them off. Under normal circumstances every cell in the body is defined and governed by definite laws of growth. Cancerous cells, however, differ from the rest of the body in that they have their own law. Wherever cancer hides, cells grow in a way that is detrimental to the body. The whole body normally joins together to fight diseases, but with cancer, the whole body joins together to feed the illness and to help its growth and expansion. The result is destruction to the whole body. Our outer man is like a cancer cell; it has become a second center, a separate area of growth. Some people are cancerous in that the more we feed them with spiritual things, the more arrogant they become. Some people are full of opinions; they can even be given the name of Opinion. Their entire being is an aggregate of opinions. Worse still, they are unwilling to subject themselves to dealings. These ones become cancers in the Body of Christ. The more spiritual experiences they have, the more they remain in darkness. Cancer areas are centers of division. Cancer cells absorb and expand to build up their own centers. Our outer man is a cancer to the Body of Christ. We must deal with it severely. We have to remove it, cut it out, and reject it. We have to deal with the outer man like dealing with cancer.</p><h2 class="head4">The Separation of the Inner Man from the Outer Man</h2><p>God destroys and breaks down our outer man in two ways. First, He deals with it by the rebukes from the ministry of the word. When the Lord cursed the fig tree, it wilted. No matter how strong we are, as soon as the Lord takes hold of us in His mercy, He rebukes us through the ministry of the word. Such strong words will shatter our whole being. This kind of ministry of the word is not an ordinary ministry. It does not scratch us politely in insignificant areas; rather, it overpowers us. We hope that the church will have many such ministries. Second, He breaks down our outer man through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The expression the discipline of the Holy Spirit is our invention. It means the operation of the Holy Spirit through His ordering of our outward environment. The Holy Spirit works within us as well as in our environment. For example, Brother Chow has a big problem with his emotion. It is not easy to touch it unless our brother first puts himself under the hand of God. If our brother hands himself over to God, God will work on him through the Holy Spirit and will put him to death through the environment. The Holy Spirit will coordinate His inward operation with His outward discipline and bring him through. A person must pass through such experiences. God will not let him go. There must be a fundamental breaking experience. Then this experience should be followed by the Spirit's continual discipline. This is how the stubborn outer man is defeated. This work is seen all too rarely in the church today. Every brother and sister has to be open to advice and exhortation. We have to ask God for grace to receive rebukes from others. If anyone is angry at a rebuke, we should ask him whether he is living on this earth for his own "face" or for God to have a way through him.</p><p>The work of the Holy Spirit is like the work of the duck farmers in Foochow. Ducks like to roam freely, and the farmers have to goad them with a rod before they fall into line. The Lord has been disciplining some people in many ways for years, yet they are still turning around in circles. We should not be like dumb ducks. We have to take lessons from the discipline of the Holy Spirit. After we learn our lessons, we will be able to deal with the brothers and sisters, and we will be able to preach the gospel and serve God. When our outer man and inner man are separated, we will be able to keep outward things separate from the inner man; they will not be able to affect the inner man. We will be able to effectively convey the things in our inner being. We will have the ministry and the supply, and the power within us will be released.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN AND<br />THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Friday morning, May 28, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><h2 class="head3">The Limited Power of the<br />Outer Man</h2><p>Before we come to the fourth result of the breaking of the outer man, we should first ask ourselves why the outer man has to be broken before the inner man can be released. We all know that there is a limit to man's physical strength. For example, a man may be able only to lift thirty pounds. Suppose he is walking down a road with thirty pounds of goods on his shoulder, and he sees a little beautiful table that weighs ten pounds. Do you think he can pick up the table and carry it home? Of course not, he is limited to thirty pounds. He cannot add another ten pounds. The only thing he can do is stare at the table and leave it where it is. The thirty pounds define his responsibility and measure; they are his necessary restraint. There is a limitation to his physical strength; he cannot add another ten pounds. In the same way, there is a limit to the capacity of our outer man, our thoughts, our intelligence, our opinion, and our sentiments. There is a limit to the capacity of our soul.</p><p>Many people realize that there is a limit to their physical strength, but they do not realize that there is a limit to the power of their outer man as well. For example, there is a limit to human affection. Even a man who is rich in emotion cannot exercise an unlimited amount of love. If he devotes all of his love to his family, he does not have much strength to love others. Even a heavyweight champion cannot do everything. A girl can love her friends at school, but the presence of this love may mean that she cannot spare any more of her love to her mother at home. There is a limit to love. A man cannot love everyone. In the same principle, there is a limit to our thoughts. Those who are too busy with their own thoughts do not have any available strength to give thought to their inner man when the spirit needs release. At such times, the thoughts actually become a hindrance to the release of the spirit. Some people are strong in their will. They are never short of suggestions, and they are more than willing to be a counselor to others. We may think that these ones are unlimited in their energy. However, many so-called strong ones find their will wavering when they are confronted by God to make a decision. They do not know how to make decisions with regard to things related to God. Their will power has been exhausted on other things, and their will wavers like a flag fluttering in the wind. Man's will is limited in its capacity.</p><p>We must see that the power of the outer man, that is, the power of the soul, like the power of the physical body, is limited in its capacity. This is the reason the outer man has to be broken. The soul has to be dealt with so that it does not act independently from the spirit. We must not allow the outer man to exhaust its energy, or the spirit cannot use it. Our mind, emotion, and will should be tempered so that they may be under the direction of our spirit.</p><h2 class="head4">The Emotion Being Limited</h2><p>The breaking of the outer man involves the dealing with the mind, emotion, and will of the outer man. Those who are influenced by their emotion and who are very emotional are limited in the amount of love they can give. When they love a person, they are attached to him like a bee to honey. When they hate a person, they treat him like an enemy. This emotional proclivity must be seriously dealt with and broken before God can use their outer man. If a man's emotion is dealt with and his love is "broken," God will use him to love all kinds of people. Being broken in one's emotion does not mean that a person has lost his ability to love. It means that he has lost his inclination and choice in the way he exercises his love. Now a person can love all men and all saints. The Lord has to remove our emotional proclivities from their very roots so that our emotion can become useful to God and no longer be focused on the self. If a man loves his wife and children with all his heart and mind, he is so busy with this love that he has no more strength to love others. He is not able to love the church or the brothers and sisters. The Lord must deal with his emotion by applying the Spirit's discipline through the environment or by rebuking him through the ministry of the word. In this way his outer man is broken and his inner man is free to love all men. Our inner man is not free because our outer man is too strong and busy. When the outer man is busy with its own affairs, the spirit cannot be released. The inner man wants to love, but the outer man may have used up all of its love.</p><h2 class="head4">The Mind Being Limited</h2><p>Many people like to indulge themselves in their own whimsical thoughts. From morning until night they are lost in wild imaginations. Their mind is like a machine that is on all day long; it is always busy. They exhaust all of their mental energy on their thoughts. When the spirit calls for the mind to help, there is no strength left in the mind. The spirit wants to flow out, but the mind cannot provide a channel for its release. This means that the mind has formed a strong blockage. The sharper a man's mind is, the duller he can be to spiritual things. A smart person needs God's mercy to control his thoughts. When the spirit within has something to say, our mind should be able to convey this word to others. We must control our mind. If our mind spins around all day long, it will not be able to meet the spirit's demand. The brothers from northern Kiangsu are very smart; they are rich in thought and knowledge. However, they have not acquired much reality in spiritual things. Many people are needlessly grieving for the Spirit. However, the Bible only says that we should not grieve the Spirit. These ones do not have to think so much; they do not have to be anxious for so many things. When the spirit wants to be released, it needs the support of the mind. The inner man is expressed through the outer man. The busier a man's mind is, the less his spirit can be expressed. The mind of one who is broken in the outer man can respond to the words and directions of the spirit. If a man's mind is always occupied with his own things, his inner man will be bound. The inner man cannot survive alone or move independently.</p><h2 class="head4">The Will Being Limited</h2><p>Some people like to be others' counselors. They even like to be God's counselors. They like to make proposals, suggestions, and arrangements, and they like to give directions. If they use up their entire will on these things, they are powerless to serve God when their will is called upon by God to obey Him. A person with a pliable will before God is very decisive when it comes to making a stand for God. Throughout history we can see some of the most pliable persons making some of the toughest decisions. Those who have been touched by God in their will do not like to make their own proposals. The will does not become stronger through repeated use. If we wear it out, it will not serve us when we have to make necessary decisions before God. A strong-willed person often crumples to the floor as soon as he faces opposition. His will is strong in things related to the self, but he falls as soon as he faces some tests from God. Peter was a strong-willed person before he experienced the Lord's dealing. His toughness was undealt with; it was a toughness within himself. This toughness led to his denial of the Lord three times. It is difficult for the Lord to teach those whose natural will is strong. When Peter was threatened by death, he ran away. His toughness was raw. He needed the Lord to deal with him thoroughly and to break his natural toughness into pieces. This was the only way his will could be used by his spirit. Many martyrs were strong in their will because they were dealt with by the Lord. Their will was both pliable and strong.</p><h2 class="head4">Conditions after the Breaking of the Outer Man</h2><p>What conditions do we find after the outer man is broken? First, a man who is broken is a right person; he becomes proper in the eyes of God. What then is a revival? A revival is the result of men being broken before God. When men are broken, they are revived. Where there is breaking, there is revival. A broken man can bring revival wherever he goes. This revival does not come through prayer. (I am not by any means despising revivals that come through prayer.) Some people think that prayer changes the mind of an unwilling and reluctant God and forces Him to bless us. However, God is the God of all blessings. Even though He is very eager to bless us, He often does not find the right persons to bless; He does not find the proper channel. This is the reason He wants us to pray. We do not pray to make God willing. Rather, we pray to make ourselves right. We do not struggle to make God willing. Rather, we give ourselves to His breaking so that we become right persons before God. Then God will have a way through us. If the outer man is not broken, the spirit will not be released with power.</p><p>God makes His advance through a broken man. As soon as a man is broken, the distance between his spirit and other men is shortened; he becomes approachable to others. His spirit is free to move anytime. He does not have to go around in circles trying to say what he wants to say. His outer shell is broken, and the separation between him and others is gone. Others can draw near to him easily, and he will know men easily. He becomes very approachable and very ready to render help to others.</p><p>A person can take control of his own spirit if his outer man is broken. He can use his spirit anytime. Even when power is released from his spirit, he will still be in control. We have to be willing to fall before God and to accept His breaking. Then we will be able to take control of our spirit, and we will bring blessing to every meeting. Whether or not a meeting will receive blessing depends on us; we can control the amount of blessing a meeting receives. Once we are dealt with by the Lord, we can control our spirit. When we push out our spirit, it will be released, and we will bring blessing to the meeting. Once we can exercise our inner man at will, our spirit will not be affected by our outer man. We will be able to control our spirit. We will become God's minister, and we will be free to dispense blessing to a meeting or withhold blessing from it. The power to control one's spirit rests with the minister.</p><h2 class="head2">Ready to Receive Others' Spirit</h2><h2 class="head3">Ready to Receive Help from Others</h2><p>The fourth benefit from the breaking of the outer man is that it becomes easy for others' spirit to come into us. In other words it becomes easy for one to receive help from others. The breaking of the outer man is very much related to the way we live. When the outer man is dealt with, we can respond to the slightest movement in others' spirit. It becomes easy for us to receive supply from others, and it becomes easy for others' spirit to get into us. Even the slightest move of the spirit of a very simple Christian will render supply to us. The spirit of others' will become a supply to us. If the Spirit of God is moving, yet we do not touch Him even though we are in the midst of this moving, it proves that we are living in the outer man. For example, we may walk into a denomination, and we may find many things which we can criticize. However, there should always be something of the Spirit from which we can receive supply. If we find it hard to receive help from anyone, it proves that our outer man is not broken. Our spirit cannot go out to others, and others' spirit cannot come into us. A person whose outer man is dealt with can receive help very easily from others. A sister once said that she does not take in others' words easily. A brother once said that he was never easily moved by anyone. Another brother said that he never shed any tears. We surely can say that these ones have a very hard outer man. They have to be put to death, and their hard shells have to be cracked. The shell of the grain in John 12 is very hard; it has to fall into the ground and be softened and cracked by moisture and pressure before the germ within will spring forth. When a man's outer shell is broken, he will find it easy to listen to others and to be touched by others. He will not only find it easy to release his spirit and touch others, but he will notice his own mistakes, repent, and confess his mistakes easily. He will be able to afford a free and generous course for others' spirits to come into him and his own spirit to flow out to others.</p><p>There was a brother who had a certain weakness all the time. It was a typical weakness found among brothers. The responsible brothers spoke to him more than once and reminded him of his weakness. However, it was a tough spot in him, and exhortation did not help him. What should we do with such a brother? We have to muster up enough indignation within before we can deal with him. Before we can deal with our brother's problem, the burden and pressure within us must build up, and the indignation must grow. When this burden finally reaches a certain critical point, we will pour out our indignation on the brother. Even though he may have built up a hard shell around himself, our word will break him like a hammer. It will not brush him superficially like a little broom. In this way he will get some help from our word.</p><p>When a person's outer man is broken, others' spirits find it easy to touch him. It is hard to give some people a word of advice. We can say all we want, but their nodding does not mean anything. A broken man, however, is ready to repent. It is easy for him to confess his wrong and to yield to others. If a man is not broken, even his outward meekness will not do him any good. Sooner or later he will be stirred up, and he will create greater havoc. Many people are hard, intransigent, and stubborn because they have never given up their self, their face, and their pride. They want to preserve their own pride and face. A broken man, however, is different. It is easy for him to give in and to confess his mistakes. It is hard to touch the hearts of some people. It seems that they have to be hit with a hammer before their hearts can be touched. It is hard to deal with such ones, and it is hard for them to receive help from others. It is hard to get through in those whose outer man is not broken. Those whose spirit is so unapproachable are always a problem to the other brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head3">Ready to Receive Frank Words</h2><p>I will use Brother Sun Feng-lu as an example. He was a magistrate, a job which requires the shrewdness of a politician. Before he was saved, his spirit was closed. Other people would never speak an honest word to him out of fear of being incriminated. Everyone acted diplomatically around him. After he believed in the Lord, the church would have suffered great confusion if he had continued in his politics and maneuvering. He would, of course, have been wrong, but we would have been wrong as well. In such a case, the church would no longer have been the church, but a worldly society. In the church we are all open to one another. We accept the breaking and do not want to save our face. This makes it easier for us to speak to one another, and it brings in more genuineness. Others are able to speak an honest word to us when we are wrong. By nature Brother Sun does not take others' words easily. But if his outer man and inner man are separated, many problems will go away. If we are afraid of offending this brother or that sister, we will not dare say anything, and the church will become a social organization, a community of politicians and diplomats. Our outer man must be broken. This is how we can speak the truth to one another and how we can mutually edify and perfect one another.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S WORD SEPARATING THE OUTER MAN<br />FROM THE INNER MAN</h2><p>The breaking of our outer man is through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. God does not intend to just break our outer man, but to separate it from the inner man. On the one hand, God wants to break our outer man. On the other hand, the outer man must not become a hindrance to the inner man. This is the reason God has to divide our soul from our spirit. Concerning this, we have to read Hebrews 4:12-13. These two verses show us that the soul and the spirit can be divided. The inner man and the outer man can be divided from each other. This division is done by the word of God, and this division is like the separation of the joints from the marrow. God's word divides the soul from the spirit, and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart. It is living and operative, and it is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit. The innermost parts of man's body are the joints and marrow. The two-edged sword is so sharp that it is able even to divide these two things and to expose them to the eyes. The same can be said of the word with regard to its function in dividing the thoughts and intentions of the heart. The function of God's word is to divide the thoughts and intentions of the heart. This means that we are made as naked and bare before our own eyes as we are before God's eyes. There is no creature that is not manifest before Him. All things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the One who created them. When God divides our soul from our spirit, we will see ourselves as God sees us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR THE SOUL<br />BEING MIXED UP WITH THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />LIVING IN DARKNESS</h2><p>God deals with us in two ways. On the one hand, the outer man has to be broken. This is done mainly through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, the outer man, the soul, and the inner man, the spirit, must be separated from each other. This is mainly done through the light of revelation from God's word. We should study how this process is realized in our experience. The division of the soul from the spirit is not accomplished through one particular act of God. When God gives us light, we see what is of the spirit and what is of the soul. We have to realize that darkness is the reason for them being mixed up. Without darkness, there could not be a mixture. The spirit and soul are mixed up because of man's ignorance, blindness, and darkness. When we are in darkness, we do not know what the spirit is and what the soul is. We do not know what the outer man is and what the inner man is. When a man is in darkness, he feels that everything is good and fine. Many people think that they are Christians already, that they obey God, enjoy His blessings, receive answers to their prayers, and turn men to the Lord through their testimonies. As they consider themselves in this way, they may say that the heart is wicked, but they do not actually know how wicked the heart is. They may say that they are corrupted, but they do not know how corrupted they are. Even while they are saying these things, they are appreciating themselves. They think that they cannot be all that bad since they are a recipient of God's blessings. These ones are void of light within. They do not know what things are done by the spirit and what things are done by the soul. They do not realize that their soul is mixed up with their spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S WORD WITH HIS LIGHT<br />EXPOSING MAN'S TRUE CONDITION</h2><p>In order for these ones to be delivered, they have to see God's word. One day&mdash;and we do not know when that day will be, but sooner or later&mdash;God's word will come, and it will come with light. When God's light comes with the word, it manifests the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Prior to this, a person may think that his inward motives, thoughts, and everything else are for the Lord and that he is a totally consecrated person. However, when he steps into God's light and he is enlightened, he will realize the wickedness that lies within him. He will realize how much his thoughts and motives are for himself, how much his work is according to the flesh and the soul, and how much he seeks for man's glory. His many thoughts and hopes are set on position, fame, and gain. When a man lives in darkness, he has many problems, and he does not know the thoughts and motives of his heart. When light comes, he will realize that nothing is as he thought. He will abhor the many base thoughts in his mind, and he will realize that he is a totally self-centered person. He will feel ashamed. This is not a miraculous act of God. God merely shines His light on him and shows him his true condition. Nevertheless, the light is so strong that his true condition will be fully exposed and unveiled. He will repent and groan, and he will fall down like a lame man helplessly before God. This repentance and remorse will result in the breaking of the outer man.</p><p>When God's word comes, His light also comes. It comes as a sword. The word does not ask anything about our work or occupation. When it comes, God exposes our intentions. His light exposes our thoughts and intentions. We will no longer be able to justify ourselves or go on in the same way. Under the light we will see that our virtues are sin, our zeal is carnality, and our service to God is nothing but the flesh. Formerly, we had one kind of evaluation. Now we have a different kind of evaluation. Through this fundamental and intense revelation of our soul, the spirit and the soul are divided and the thoughts and intentions of the heart are discerned. If our soul is not divided from our spirit, we cannot work by the spirit; we can only work by the soul. God wants us to know how strong our soul is and how weak our spirit is. Once we see this, we will identify many areas as being soulish; they belong to the outer man. Our inner man will be enlightened through this seeing. This revelation will separate the inner man from the outer man. Our soul will be paralyzed; it will deflate like a punctured tire. This is the separation of the soul from the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING OURSELVES AS GOD KNOWS US</h2><p>Verse 13 of Hebrews 4 is equally as important as verse 12. These two verses are linked together. What is the standard by which God enlightens us, exposes us, and discerns the thoughts and intentions of our heart? What kind of revelation can be considered true revelation? Verse 13 says that we are naked and laid bare before God. We are fully exposed before Him; there is nothing we can hide. Any kind of covering merely veils our eyes; it does not cover the Lord's eyes. If God is merciful to us, we will be exposed and laid bare. We will know ourselves as God knows us. This is God's way of salvation. God wants us to know ourselves as He knows us. His salvation is not to crucify us on the cross again. The Lord has accomplished everything on the cross already. He has crucified us on the cross already. What we need from God is light to see our true condition. This is revelation. The light of this revelation will kill our outer man. This is how the outer man is separated from the inner man.</p><p>I have been saying this for many years. Although we have failed, I will still repeat the same thing today. One day God will shine a great light on us, and we will see. Just a small glimpse will precipitate the division of our soul from our spirit. The work of dividing the soul from the spirit does not occur in the spirit, but in the soul. God first points out our soul to us, and then we find out how much spirit we have. Once everything is laid bare before God's eyes and we see it as God sees it, our soul will not be able to stand up again. It will lose its steam. This seeing will move the soul away from the spirit. When the spirit and the soul are divided from each other, we will have a way to go on. This is a very solemn thing. The division of the soul and spirit is not a debate involving the parts of man, but a matter of light. God's word is sharper than a sword; it is an exposing and stripping word. Once this word shines, our soul is divided from our spirit. The dividing of the spirit from the soul brings us the knowledge of what is included in the soul; it does not bring us the knowledge of what is included in the spirit. Light has to come before we realize what is of the soul and how much our righteousness, goodness, zeal, and consecration are of ourselves. We can know how to go on only to the extent that we have been enlightened. We have to fall flat on our face and acknowledge, "I need the cleansing of the Lord's blood even for my tears of repentance. May the Lord grant me more light."</p><p>We do not know how this light comes to us. It can come to us through our conversation with the brothers, through a frank word from the ministry of the word, through the many trials that arise in our circumstances, or through the burden of many things upon our shoulder. We do not know how light comes, but we know that it has to come. If it does not come, there is no way for the soul and the spirit to be divided. We have to deal with this matter in a fundamental way. Unless we deal with it, what is the use of more theology or knowledge? If God grants us mercy and shows us light, we will see our true condition. Once light comes, we will not have to try to humble ourselves, love the brothers, or act humble. Spontaneously we will be humble. Spontaneously we will love the brothers and become humble. This is where the crux of our problem lies. Once the outer man and the inner man are separated, many problems will be solved spontaneously.</p><p>There are several results from the division of the inner man from the outer man. First, we will enjoy spontaneous fellowship with God. This fellowship will not need to be deliberate. Second, we will spontaneously know other men. Third, our spirit will be released in the course of our work. The power of the Holy Spirit will also be released. When others touch us, they will touch the spirit. Fourth, we will receive supply from many directions. The whole church will become our supply. What a rich life we will experience if we open up our entire spirit to the Lord!</p><h2 class="head1">THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN BRINGING<br />RICHES TO THE CHURCH</h2><p>When the outer man is broken, we will see the Body of Christ and the riches of this Body. As our outer man is broken, both we and the church are enriched. Today the brothers and sisters are starving to death because only one pair of hands is able to feed them; they are able only to listen to one man's speaking. They cannot receive supply from many people. We are poor today because we are not able to receive many things from others' spirit. When our outer man is broken, we may not be able to render help to others immediately, but at least we will be revived and begin to find supply from others. How much supply can a broken man draw from others! The whole church will become his supply. If the outer man is not broken, he will still act like an infant, and he will only recognize his own nurse. If there is not a supply from many sources, we will end up in poverty. This poverty is indeed unnecessary. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us light to divide our soul from our spirit so that our outer man will be broken.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, we consecrate ourselves to You once again. You are the faithful and trustworthy Lord. It is better and safer for us to fall into Your hand than to remain within ourselves. You can arrange everything for our good. We do not wish to be those who are waiting for the light, but those who are open to the light. We are not here to wait for things to happen to us. Rather, we accept Your hand and acknowledge Your grace. Divide our spirit from our soul and break our outer man today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Morning, May 29, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><p>Brother Hsie: Is the outer man broken and dealt with by God through one great blow, or is this accomplished through a gradual process?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Our outer man is broken because it is a hindrance to God's work, not because it has done something wrong. We cannot hasten God's work, but we can certainly delay His work. A man may or may not know if his outer man is broken, but others surely know, just as anyone touching a saved person knows whether or not he is saved. Of course, the one doing the touching must be saved before he can discern whether or not others are saved.</p><p>God breaks us gradually step by step. He works on us until our outer man is no longer whole and hard. God has to bring us through one, ten, or even twenty breakings. One day the breaking will be complete; our outer, hard shell will be completely gone. We can delay God's work, but we can never hasten His work. All we have to do is condemn our peculiarities, commit ourselves to the faithful God, and look to Him for mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION<br />BETWEEN THE HEART AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between the heart and the spirit? What is the difference between an evil heart and a wrong spirit?</p><p>Answer: The main thing about the heart is our motives. There are many evil things in the heart, such as pride, jealousy, and hatred. If our heart is proud, our spirit will be defiled when it passes through such a heart. Our heart contains all kinds of terrible things like pride, jealousy, and greed. The spirit does not contain evil things like the heart does. But when the spirit moves through the heart, it is contaminated and colored by the tainted elements of the heart. The spirit itself certainly does not have such elements, but in its release, the pride that is in the heart attaches itself to the spirit, and the spirit becomes a proud spirit. Sometimes the jealousy in one's heart is attached to the spirit. When the spirit is released, it becomes a spirit of jealousy. If a man is humble and meek in his heart, he will appear to others as having a humble spirit. If the heart is not right, the spirit is not necessarily touched. However, the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart. When we say that a man has an improper spirit, we are actually saying that he has improper things in his heart, and that these things flow out with his spirit when he speaks or moves. When the spirit moves, it conveys various characteristic colors. These colors come from the heart. If a man is evil in some way, his spirit will convey this evil to others. Therefore, we know a person's heart by his spirit.</p><p>Question: How can we tell the difference between an unbeliever's spirit and a believer's spirit?</p><p>Answer: The spirit of an unbeliever is dead toward God; it does not function in that regard. As for the nature of their spirit, we can distinguish it by the outward attitude unbelievers display. We know their spirit by their attitude. The same cannot be said of believers. A brother may have a right attitude, but the spirit that flows out may be wrong. We should know a saved brother by his spirit. As for unbelievers, we can discern their spirit from the attitude they display. It is hard to discern their spirit by any other means.</p><h2 class="head1">CONDITIONS FOR THE MINISTRY OF LIFE</h2><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen: Is the breaking of the outer man the basic qualification for the ministry of life?</p><p>Watchmen Nee: Basically speaking, if a man wants to minister life to others, his outer man must be broken. It is difficult to speak many things if the outer man is not broken. If a worker never speaks what is within him or cannot impart to others what is within him no matter how hard he tries, this indicates that he is not yet a broken man. If the outward shell of a man is not broken, it is hard for him to approach others. Only a broken man can approach others; he has no outward shell to frustrate him. The hem of the Lord's garment was the most superficial and furthermost thing on the Lord's body. It was not as intimate as the collar or the sleeves. But the Lord's power reached further than the hem of His garment. When the woman with the issue of blood touched this hem, her flow of blood stopped immediately. Even the most outward thing of the Lord was able to heal; His power reached to the furthermost part of His whole body, and this power was diffused out through His outer man. This tells us that He was very approachable to men. There was no distance between Him and other men. Even His garment was able to heal. Of course, some people could not touch the hem of His garment. With us distance is a problem, but with God, this problem does not exist. Everyone who desires blessing can receive blessing today. The Lord does not have any shell surrounding Him. Only we do. This is the reason the outward shell must be broken before we can touch life and minister life to others. If the shell remains intact, life will not flow. If two men are together and the shells of both remain intact, neither will touch life in the other.</p><p>The supply of life can be likened to the process of grafting. In order for two branches to be grafted together, the bark of both branches has to be stripped. If the bark is not stripped and the two branches are merely tied together, the branches will never grow together no matter how long one waits, even if one waits until the time of the great white throne. If our shell is broken, we will touch others as soon as there is a crack in them. Unless there are cracks, putting two parties together will only result in death, even though either party can be living. The same can be said about skin transplants; both the grafted part and the grafting part must be cut. Only life will touch life. If a protective covering remains in either party, nothing will happen. The same law of life applies to plant and animal life, and the same can be said of the spiritual life. It is inexcusable for the shell of a minister to remain whole. Such ones will not be able to supply others with life.</p><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen: Do we need to seek for more empowering of the spirit before we can minister abundantly to others?</p><p>Watchman Nee: This question can be answered with either a yes or a no. Although Ephesians 3:16 tells us to pray to be strengthened into the inner man, the inner man will not be released, no matter how much it is strengthened, unless the outer man is broken. As soon as the outer man is broken, the inner man will be strengthened and will flow out spontaneously. A man must have the first step, that is, his outer man must be broken, before the strengthening of the inner man will become useful to him. Many servants of the Lord may be weak in their outward body, yet they are strong in their inner man. In many cases the inner man is weak because the outer man is too strong. If the outer man is weakened, crippled, and toppled, the inner man will spontaneously become strong and be released. The more the outer man is broken, the more grace the inner man will deliver. We do not have to ask whether or not the inner man is strengthened. We only need to ask whether the Lord has accomplished any breaking work in us.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE GOSPEL OF PENTECOST</h2><p>Question: How can we recover the gospel of power that was at Pentecost?</p><p>Answer: The kind of people we save depends on the kind of gospel we preach. Although I cannot say with absolute certainty, I do believe that the preaching of our gospel must be accompanied by God's mighty power in the future, just as it was with the apostles' preaching at the time of Pentecost. At that time a person sold all that he had as soon as he believed in the Lord. He consecrated himself totally to the Lord and served Him in an absolute way. Today many people preach the gospel by telling a few lighthearted stories, and men are saved in a lighthearted way. We preach the gospel in a halfhearted way, and we bring in halfhearted Christians. If we continue in this way, we probably will have to wait for many years before we dare to speak about consecration. We need absolute gospel preachers before we will have absolute testimonies of salvation. Sooner or later our gospel will have to be the gospel of the kingdom. When the gospel of the kingdom is preached, men will be delivered from all kinds of bondages. They will be delivered from sin, from the world, and from money.</p><p>God will work on us step by step until our whole being is consumed and poured out to be a blessing to the church. We have to be recovered back to Pentecost. We have to preach the gospel like men did then. Those who are saved have to be saved the same way as men were saved then, and they have to consecrate themselves just as men did then. When Zaccheus turned to the Lord, his two hands were stripped of everything. An extortioner by trade, he ended up giving half of what he owned to the poor and returning four times whatever he had taken by false accusation (Luke 19:8). This is the genuine gospel of the kingdom of the heavens. When we say we preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens today, we are merely preaching one item of it&mdash;the forgiveness of sin. The rest is not preached. Preaching the gospel of forgiveness is only giving others the bare minimum.</p><p>God is taking the way of recovery today. We should not lightly regard the Lord's recovery. The church is forever advancing. The apostolic age lasted only for a few decades. Today we have two thousand years of history behind us. The truth of the gospel is much clearer today than at the time of the apostles. Although we cannot say that it is clearer than at Paul's time, at least we can say that it is clearer than at Peter's time. Today the church as a whole has more experience than it had at the time of the apostles. At the time of the apostles, the Judaistic shell was not completely shed. This shell remained until after the writing of the book of Hebrews. Clement, one of the church fathers, wrote an epistle to the church in Corinth. However, I cannot say that I appreciate his writings very much, because his gospel could not even match our gospel today. Around 60 A.D. the gospel became obscured. This is the reason John had to stand up to affirm the gospel once more around 90 A.D. In one respect the church has become desolate. In the last century J. N. Darby was the first and only one who spoke about the desolate state of the church. Today the fundamental truth of Christ's salvation has become more clearly and firmly established than ever. However, the church is still missing the power of Pentecost.</p><p>Through its desolation and degradation, Christianity has fallen into five kinds of groups. First, there is the Roman Catholic Church. It claims to be a direct descendant of the apostle Peter, and it does not admit that the church is desolate. Second, there are the Brethren, with Darby as their representative. He was the only one who dared to stand up to declare the desolate state of the church. Yet he himself was a proof that the church was not altogether desolate. Third, there are the Congregationalists who consider the local assembly to be the basic sphere of all activities. They do not see the church at large. For them there is not an issue over Protestantism or Catholicism but over church rule, which is based on the decision of the local congregation. Fourth, there are those who have adopted a system of bishops. They base their practice on the book of Timothy, in which Timothy was appointed by Paul to be an overseer, or bishop, over the elders. They regard a bishop as a chief elder. The chairman among the elders is the bishop, who is supposed to inherit all of the apostles' authority. From this practice comes the ordination of many pastors. These ones do not realize that the Bible considers elders and overseers (or bishops) as being the same group of people. Fifth, there are the Presbyterians. They say that the apostolic age is over, since the biblical apostles are all dead. However, they believe that we still have elders. Those who are ministering at the present time are the elders. This group does not believe in the desolation of the church either. Of the five groups, Catholicism is at one extreme, being completely autocratic, and the Brethren are at the other extreme, being completely democratic. The other three groups lie between Catholicism and Brethrenism. From each of these five groups many minor groups and sects have developed. When brothers like Darby were raised up, they had wonderful testimonies concerning church truth. Since the time of the apostle Paul, no other servant of God was as deeply acquainted with God's gospel as Darby. He was a unique example of someone who is not in desolation. In fact, he was a proof of advancement.</p><p>When the Lord was still on earth, He prophesied that the temple would be destroyed by Roman soldiers. In the apostles' time the Jewish religion was still very strong. There was a physical temple and the animal sacrifices. Even when Paul the apostle went up to Jerusalem, he tried to fulfill his vow by making offerings in the temple. This mixture of spiritual and material worship confused the believers. The Lord had to commit these material things to the destruction of the Romans. It was a blessing to us that the Romans destroyed the temple. Except for this destruction we would still be going up to Jerusalem to worship our God. Man likes to lay hold of material things, such as the temple, the altar, the priests, etc. He does not like to lay hold of spiritual things. If the temple, the altar, and the priests were still with us today, believers would turn back to Judaism easily. This is the reason the Roman soldiers had to destroy the temple, remove the altar, and annul the priesthood. This was the only way to consolidate the foundation of the church of Christ. Yet Catholicism brought some of the Judaistic elements back into Christianity. Among Christians today there are still such external elements as Buddhistic asceticism and humanistic moral and ethical practices. Those who practice these things are like the Christians of the apostolic age, who cleaved to the temple, the priests, the altar, and the offerings. On the one hand, they held dearly to the Old Testament law of Moses and the blood of the animals, and on the other hand, they would not let go of the New Testament teaching of the apostles and the precious blood of Christ the Lamb. Today the foundation of the church of Christ is more sure and solid than before. Yet the power that was with the church is missing.</p><p>In the light of the recovery of God's church today, we can say that there is an advance in the truth of the gospel. Yet we must admit that the persons preaching such a gospel are still not right. This is the reason the effect of the gospel is not as strong as it was in the age of the apostles. The church is advancing, and we should not try to turn back. There are two kinds of riches before us today. One is the riches of the recovery, and the other is the riches of the advancement of the church throughout the past nearly two thousand years. We cannot ignore these two kinds of riches. The fact that the gospel is not as effective as it was at the time of Pentecost is a problem that has to do with the church itself. We should not preach a gospel that will leave the next generation with much work to finish. If the Lord is to come back soon, nothing more needs to be said. However, if He delays, the next generation will say that they are doing the same thing that the previous generation did. The way the next generation turns out depends on the way we receive our commission from the Lord. Therefore, our recovery must be absolute. The way must be absolute, and whatever we do must be done in an absolute way. We have to be the church of Christ, one that rids itself of all influence of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Judaism.</p><p>It is not hard for a man to give up all his possessions, but it is hard for a man to give up himself. It is still harder for a man to be broken in his outer man so that God can have a free way through him. Today the demand is very high. We need to submit to authority, and we need to give ourselves to coordination. In order to obey authority and to coordinate with others, we have to be on the alert before God every step of the way. We have to clearly see what the New Testament church is. Everything depends on the amount of breaking we experience. We can only pray for Christ's desire. These are solemn days. May we go through thorough dealings with the Lord so that we can serve Him in a thorough way.</p><h2 class="head1">VOLUNTARY POVERTY</h2><p>Question: Zaccheus gave away all his possessions. Why do Christians not do the same today?</p><p>Answer: The Lord said that a man should sell his all and follow Him. This word was said only two years prior to Pentecost. It is true that the Lord was mindful of the poor, but His eyes were more on dealing with the rich when He said this. The Lord did not deal with the rich for the purpose of taking care of the poor. (Judas suggested selling the ointment to give to the poor, but the Lord did not agree with this.) He knew that a man cannot be a good Christian as long as money is kept tightly in his hand. Giving to the poor is merely a means; the goal is to deal with mammon. At the time of Pentecost there were poor people in the church. The disciples turned over all the proceeds they received through the sale of possessions and put them at the feet of the apostles. These were then distributed to everyone according to his need. This is the only way to deal with the problem of money. Of course, the main purpose of the Lord's dealing with money is to free men from its entanglement. Today in the church, we also need to deal with the problem of mammon. All money should be brought to the church. Of course, there are many needs and lacks in the church today. Even if there were no lack in the church today, we would still have to give our money to it because we need to be delivered from the bondage of mammon.</p><p>In Acts 2 and 4, we find the believers in one place, sharing all things in common, selling their land and possessions, and distributing to each according to need. In chapter eleven we find a great famine, and the church in Antioch sent relief to Jerusalem. The problem of mammon must be settled. We should not think of our money as something precious when we offer it up. Rather, we should rid ourselves of it like Paul did with the snake. A Christian should loathe having mammon in his hand. He should take the way of voluntary poverty. This is a basic teaching and a fundamental concept in the church of Christ.</p><p>Selling one's all is not a one-time act. We have to do it again and again. Those who sow much will reap much, and those who sow little will reap little. The Lord considers the act of selling one's all a kind of sowing. Those who sow much will reap much. Some brothers and sisters have sold their all two or three times already. After three or five years, they have to do the same thing again. They have to keep on doing this; they cannot stop at a certain point. Mammon is unrighteous in itself; it is an idol. Would we dare leave an idol in our house? None of us would dare do this. But if we are parsimonious, we are keeping one more idol in our house every time we keep one more dollar in it. This principle applies equally to the co-workers. They have to give their all as well. If we are not absolute in this matter, others cannot be absolute in it either. We have to see that money is a greater bondage to man than sin.</p><p>If Satan were to come to us and beat his chest, saying, "I am Satan. Worship me," everyone would run away in fear. If he unmasked himself in this way, everyone would be afraid of him. However, if he were to come under the disguise of money, everyone would worship him. Money can buy everything, even human souls. It can buy male, and it can buy female. It can buy grown-ups, and it can buy children. Our gospel must be so powerful that a sinner will give up everything as soon as he believes and enters the gate. Some may say that this is too dangerous. Who would be saved by this kind of preaching? This is awesome not only to you; it was awesome to Peter as well. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle than for a rich man to enter God's kingdom. Today, however, we have to make all the "camels" go through the eye of the needle.</p><p>During the last century, J. N. Darby and over fifty other believers sold their all to serve the Lord. Their ministry became a powerful one. St. Francis of Assisi was another example from the Catholic Church. He was burdened for the gospel yet did not have the gift of an evangelist. His speaking was uncouth. Later he retreated to the wilderness and the seashore to preach to the birds and the fish. Originally, he was a very rich man or the son of a rich man. Within a matter of days, he sold all he had, gave it to the poor, and lived a life of voluntary poverty. The order which he founded became one of the three main monastic orders in the Catholic Church. Anyone who wished to join the order had to sell his all before he could be admitted. These men were not that clear about the gospel, but their practice of voluntary poverty is commendable. Count Zinzendorf of the Moravian movement was another example of this kind of living; he lived before Darby. His church received great attention because of his political prominence. His main work was done in eastern Europe, not in western Europe. He was a wealthy landlord, yet he offered up everything he had to serve the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO DISPOSE OF ONE'S PROCEEDS<br />AFTER HE HAS SOLD HIS ALL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 2, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><p>Today's meeting is a special one. We are here to speak about the ways to dispose of the proceeds of the consecrated ones who have sold their all. I believe that we are beginning to see a tide of selling all in the church. Such a tide is of the Holy Spirit. This tide will rise higher and higher. Acts 4 says that all the people sold their houses and possessions and placed the proceeds at the feet of the apostles, distributing to each according to need. Today believers should hand over their all and place it at the feet of the church. Concerning the management of the proceeds received from the saints after they have sold their all, we have to take care of a few points.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS IN DISPOSING OF<br />THE SAINTS' PROCEEDS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Proceeds from Selling the Goods<br />Having Nothing to Do with the Co-workers</h2><p>First, every cent that is received from such a move should not be linked in any way to us; we cannot use any of this money. Any work that belongs to us or is related to us personally cannot touch this money. If anyone uses this money in this way, we should mark him and not communicate with him. If a worker tries to put his hands on it, we have to consider such a person to be a great failure in the work. It is a great shame to the Lord to be unchaste in the matter of money. It is a great mistake, an inexcusable mistake.</p><h2 class="head2">Letting the Church Deal with the Excess<br />of the Consecrated Ones</h2><p>Second, all the brothers and sisters have to offer everything to the Lord. Acts 4 says that the believers sold all that they had. We hope that all the brothers and sisters will prepare a list of all the things they offer. During the apostles' time, the church not only had the truth, but the experience of revival as well. During Pentecost there was the work of the Holy Spirit, and there was revival. At that time there was the apostles' teaching, and hence, there was the truth. The practice of selling one's all is in line with the teaching and practice of that time. By the time of Timothy, Paul spoke of the believers themselves assisting the widows in their household (1 Tim. 5:16). The church would only step in if the households were not able to handle the widows themselves. Here we find an improvement; there is an improvement from the book of Acts to 1 Timothy in the care of the widows. The seven deacons in Acts 6 were appointed because there was a need among the widows. Complaints arose because of a neglect in the care of the widows. At that time the whole church bore this burden. The Epistles to Timothy, however, were written about thirty years after the incidents in Acts 5 and 6. They were the last books that Paul wrote. Widows here represent poor people; they did not have anyone to care for them. When the care for such ones was neglected, criticism arose. It is easy to criticize, but it is hard to manage. Oversight is unavoidable when only a hundred twenty people are involved in church affairs that cover over twenty thousand believers. It was not an easy thing for a hundred twenty to serve such a big family. By the time of Timothy, Paul charged those who had widows in their household to take care of the widows themselves. From the twelve apostles to the seven deacons, there was an improvement in the bearing of church responsibility. From the whole church taking care of a burden to the individual families bearing the responsibility, there was further improvement. The matter was made less and less complicated, and there was a marked improvement in management.</p><p>There are responsibilities which the church should bear, and there are responsibilities which individuals should bear. By distributing the responsibilities this way, it becomes easy for the church to manage its affairs, and business is expedited. On the part of the saints, they should voluntarily sell all their possessions. On the part of the church, it should not impose this practice. Whatever is done at the time of revival should be improved upon at a later stage. There cannot be any improvement in the truth, but there can be improvement in the way of handling business. At the time of the apostles, there was revival and there was truth. The practical care of the church, however, improved, from management by twelve apostles to management by seven deacons, and later it moved from the hand of the church to the hand of individual households. By the time of Timothy, the widows were taken care of by the members of their own households. The way of handling things changed. There was no longer a wholesale giving away of one's entire possessions to the poor. If that were the case in Timothy, there would have been no need for individuals to care for the widows. At the present moment, we are asking the saints to write down their consecrated items on a list. The purpose of this list is to spare the saints from disposing of all they have. Rather, they should dispose of things according to a careful consideration of practical needs.</p><p>Second Corinthians 8:15 says, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack." Paul did not say that he who gathered much should be in lack. God takes away the "excess" so that no one has any "excess." Yet He has no intention for anyone to have lack. Based on this we can say that the church only deals with the "excess." When a man hands over all of his possessions, the church should return a part back to the consecrated one so that he can take care of the needs of his own household. Why should the church do this? This will save the church many problems. For example, if five hundred brothers and sisters in the church sell all of their possessions and give the money to the church, the church will have to care for the needs of five hundred poor saints. It is better for three hundred who have excess to take care of themselves and to dispose of their excess, which will fill the lack of the other two hundred. This equalizes the wealth, and the church is spared many headaches. The church is not commissioned to manage the supply of food; it should give itself to the ministry of the word. Therefore, we should try our best to ask the brothers and sisters to take care of their own needs. This does not mean that the church is returning or rebating the offerings that the saints have offered. This is not a rebate. This is not like an overpayment of taxes followed by a rebate. It is a gift from the church to the giver. Some may ask, "Does this not mean that everyone is caring for his own again?" No, we are saying that your livelihood is now rationed to you by the church. The returned goods are now the church's possession deposited in your house and entrusted to your care. They still belong to God and to the church. The church has not returned them to you. We are here to live the Body life. Every brother and sister is a servant of the Lord, and everyone is at the same time a financial supporter. This is the reason the Bible speaks of stewards. Formerly, everything belonged to you alone. Now it is the church's possession left in your care; you are assigned to this work as a steward. The tone is completely changed. Formerly you were the master; now you are the steward. We have to learn to live in the Body and to serve our God in this way.</p><h2 class="head2">The Handling of Real and Liquid Assets</h2><p>Third, at the time of Acts, the emphasis was on the disposal of real assets, not liquid assets. The properties, possessions, lands, and houses in Acts 2:44-45 and 4:32-35 were all real assets. Family treasures such as antiques and hoarded goods must be disposed of. We should not have any attachment to real assets; they have to be dealt with in a thorough way. Once we dispose of the real assets, we lose all of our roots on this earth, and all problems are solved. The real assets are items that have bound us to the earth. We have to help the brothers and sisters to be happy; we have to make them willing to be rootless persons on this earth. Of course, we have to take care of practical needs as well. Even those who sell their real estate should not give up their own dwellings. We should not decide for others whether or not they should sell their lands or houses. In consideration of the present state of affairs, it may be better for some brothers and sisters to keep their dwellings.</p><p>As for their accompanying liquid assets, we have to go back to the teaching of John the Baptist when he spoke to the Jews. He said that those who have two garments should give one to those who have not, and those who have food should do the same. Therefore, the biblical pattern is that liquid assets are given away, while real assets are sold. If the brothers and sisters have extra clothing, they can ask the church to give it away for them. The church can find out who the needy ones are and dispose of many items this way. There are too many poor ones outside the church, and we cannot take care of all of them. We should, however, take care of our brothers and sisters; we cannot allow them to remain in want. We cannot ignore their needs. It is a shameful thing if our brothers and sisters are not clothed warmly and fed adequately. The possessions we have today are partly real assets and partly liquid assets. The principle of disposal is to sell the real assets and to give away the liquid assets. Stock is halfway between a real asset and a liquid asset. Actually, it is more a real asset than a liquid asset; it is in the nature of an investment asset. Those who own lands and houses should dispose of them according to practical considerations. In some cases the brothers who own lands should continue to farm them. We have to be firm with the principle but sensitive to the actual needs in the outworking of this practice. We should not do anything in an extreme way. It is harmful to be short or to overdo.</p><h2 class="head2">Conducting One's Own Sale</h2><p>Fourth, in selling one's all, a brother or a sister has to take care of the sales personally. The church is not an auction fair. The brothers and sisters should sell their own possessions and bring the proceeds to the church. At Pentecost the believers sold their lands and houses and brought the money to the feet of the apostles. They sold the goods themselves, and they were clear as to how much they profited or lost. No one knows a person's possessions more clearly than the person himself. If these goods are handed over to the church, the church may not be familiar with the items involved and may not be able to dispose of them in the most judicious way. This will bring in complaints from the offerers. The church should never engage in any selling on behalf of the saints. We want the brothers to sell their own possessions. There is special significance to this exercise. An article that a person owns was bought by him with a price; he has been holding on to it for years. He has a special attachment for such an article. He loves and enjoys it; it is at the seat of his affection. Such a crucial parting should be executed personally by the owner. This is like a man who has a son in his old age. The son is particularly dear to him. Anything to do with the son has to be handled by his aged father personally. The brothers and sisters should do the tearing down before the Lord with their own hands. They have labored for a long time to build up this love. Now the Lord is asking them to tear it down with their own hands. God could have asked Abraham to entrust his son to someone else. He could have asked him to give Isaac to Lot for adoption, or He could have sent an angel to Mount Moriah to do the killing. God, however, wanted Abraham to take up his own sword to do the killing. This would leave a lasting wound in Abraham, and out of such a wound life would flow. The same is true with the brothers and sisters when they sell their all; they have to kill their own Isaacs. This will leave a wound in them. They have to make the cut themselves. In this way blessing will flow out of their wound.</p><h2 class="head2">Making a List</h2><p>Fifth, why should we have the saints make a list? We do not want anyone to go to the extreme. It is wrong to overdo a matter or to come short in it. The church has to walk according to truth; it has to go on step by step in a responsible way. Those who act by their emotion tend to overdo. We should not act by our emotion. We want the brothers and sisters to fellowship with the responsible brothers in the process of their dealing. The purpose of making a list is to give room for consideration. Based on these lists, the responsible ones should carefully discuss the matter with the consecrated brothers and sisters. Some have too much land or too much of other things, and they can give it to the church. For example, some may own land that is suitable for building a meeting hall for the church. The church can accept this land. In Foochow we need at least four meeting halls. I hope we can find land for them. Some items may be useful to others and should not be sold. The practice of making a list is not recorded in Acts. But it is a measure to deal with the excess. This is a matter of doing things according to proper procedure. The purpose of doing this is to avoid mistakes. The saints should make a list and ask the responsible brothers in the church to go over it with them. The list is a means to facilitate our handling of the matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Continuous Offering</h2><p>Sixth, it is not the end once a man has handed over his all. Any income received after one has handed over his all should be kept only insofar as it is necessary to maintain his livelihood. The remainder should be handed over continually. Every month or every week, a person has to keep what he needs to sustain his living. He should place the rest in God's hand. After a man has handed over his all, he will certainly become richer because he who sows much surely will reap much. Our consecration must be a continuous act.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Those Who Are in Business</h2><p>Seventh, we have a question for the brothers and sisters who are still in business: "Do you have a heart to consecrate everything?" Some people can bring their Isaac home without any trouble. Others flounder in their consecration as soon as they bring home their Isaac. Before Abraham could apply a knife to his son, he first had to apply it to himself. If, at that critical juncture, after Abraham had offered up Isaac, you had handed back Abraham's son to him and moved him back to his former position, he would not have been disturbed at all. It would not have changed anything in him. If he had never applied the knife to himself first and if there had never been a wound in him in the first place, you would spoil him by applying oil to him. Without a wound, there can be no blessing. With the brothers who are engaged in business or commerce, whatever needs to be dealt with has to be dealt with. It is better to deal with it time after time than to keep it in one's possession continually. We would rather deal with a person's possession first and then return it back to him later. It is not too good to bind something up with oil before it has ever passed through a dealing. After one has passed through a dealing, he can go on with his business or he can change it. The choice is determined by the need.</p><h2 class="head1">PRINCIPLES OF THE PRACTICE OF SELLING ALL</h2><p>We are conducting an operation. But our operation is different from a surgical operation that a doctor performs. Before a doctor performs a surgery, he first applies anesthesia. Our operation, however, is for the purpose of hurting. Spiritual operations have no need of anesthetic. We are not after man's wealth; we are after men who will forsake all. Therefore, the principle of dealing with the disposed goods is to bring the maximum spiritual benefit to men. We will not and cannot uphold any other principles. You may say that I am cruel. Yes, I am cruel. I want to see wounds in the brothers and sisters. It is a great blessing to have wounds. I want you to deal with your possessions to the point that you have wounds. It has to be a consecration that brings tears, that hurts. It is all right to hurt; this is the only way blessing will flow. First, ask the consecrated ones to pour out the wine generously. Do not apply the oil on them too soon. The greater the wound, the greater will be the result.</p><p>Having said this, we have to give others the assurance that the church always makes the best provisions. Even if the church makes some mistakes occasionally, the saints should bear with them. The church can be wrong at times, but the discipline of the Holy Spirit can never be wrong. Our experience may tell us that an arrangement of the church is not that suitable, but at least we can experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We have to practice this conscientiously according to the revelation of God's Word. If we do this, we will receive the blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">MAMMON</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 2, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><p>All the co-workers should speak the same thing concerning mammon when they set out for the work. There is only one way to deal with mammon, and no one should change it at will. We have to go on together in the same way. We should have the same view towards mammon. The Bible is very clear about this subject. Let us take a look at what it says.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MAMMON</h2><h2 class="head2">It Being an Idol</h2><p>First, the Bible describes mammon as an idol. The Bible always places mammon in opposition to God. There is no true atheist in this world. The Bible does not recognize non-Christians as adherents of other religions. It classifies men into only two categories: those who are serving God and those who are serving mammon. Other religions, such as Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, etc., are counterfeit religions. There are only two true objects of worship: mammon and God. Therefore, mammon is an idol; it is an object apart from God that is being worshipped. It is unthinkable for a Christian to pray and read the Bible on the one hand, and bow to Kuanyin (a Buddhist goddess) and burn incense to her on the other hand. The minimum requirement of being a Christian is to turn from idols to serve the living God (1 Thes. 1:9). We all agree that we have to cast down all idols. Yet we do not consider mammon to be an evil thing. This is a gross mistake. We must be clear that we cannot worship idols, and we must equally be clear that we cannot worship mammon. We cannot serve God and mammon. Mammon is an idol.</p><p>We must never tell others that they need to offer their mammon because we need to build meeting halls or because we need to take care of the work or the poor. We should never lower the meaning of consecration to the level of satisfying needs. This denigrates the meaning of consecration. We deal with mammon not because of our need but because it is an idol. A man can say that he does not want to offer money for building meeting halls. He also can say that he does not want to care for the poor brothers and sisters, but he must not worship idols. Dealing with mammon is not a matter of being rich or poor; it is a matter of idolatry. When we sing, we have to start with the right pitch. It is wrong to start with a pitch that is too high or too low. In the same way, our pitch has to be right with respect to the way we handle mammon. We have to see that mammon is diametrically opposed to God. We should not tell others to give up mammon because we are short of money. If this were the case, they might conclude that they can worship mammon when there is not a lack of money. We must rid ourselves of mammon because mammon is God's enemy. It is terribly wrong for a Christian to remain in a temple of Dagon. It is equally wrong for the idol of mammon to remain in the saints' homes. We are not speaking about being rich or poor. We are saying that mammon as an idol must be removed.</p><p>We have to show Christians that mammon is an idol; it is something that demands worship. It is something apart from God. This problem must be addressed. The Bible does not say that all those who are poor are blessed; it says that those who are poor in spirit are blessed. Being poor in spirit is being poor voluntarily. All the beggars in this world are not poor in spirit. Even those who do not have money can still worship it as an idol in their heart. Mammon indeed usurps man's worship. We must discuss this matter in a thorough way. Mammon is an idol, and Christians must deal with mammon in a thorough way. This matter must be settled.</p><h2 class="head2">Deliverance from Mammon Being<br />a Part of Our Salvation</h2><p>Second, being delivered from mammon is a part of our salvation. We have to show the brothers and sisters, according to the New Testament, first that mammon is an idol, and second that we have been delivered from mammon. Deliverance from mammon is part of our salvation. It is like deliverance from sin, the world, and the flesh. Many people know that in order to be saved, a man must be delivered from sin, from God's punishment, and from the world's bondage, but many people do not know that salvation includes deliverance from mammon. In Luke 18 and 19, three things&mdash;eternal life, the kingdom of the heavens, and salvation&mdash;are linked together. All three things relate to mammon. First, the young ruler wanted to inherit eternal life. The Lord told him to sell all that he had and to follow Him. Second, the Lord spoke on the difficulty of a rich man's entry into God's kingdom. It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter God's kingdom! He went on to say that those who give up houses, wives, or children for the kingdom's sake would receive a hundredfold in this age and eternal life in the age to come. An entry into God's kingdom requires the forsaking of one's all. Peter was saved because he forsook his all. Those who are able to avoid the fate of a camel which has difficulty passing through a needle's eye are the ones who have forsaken their all to enter the kingdom of the heavens. Third, Zaccheus gave half of his possessions to the poor, and the Lord said that salvation had come to his house. Therefore, in order for a man to receive eternal life, the kingdom, and salvation, he has to be delivered from mammon and to dispose of everything.</p><p>Today we are not doing a fund-raising work. We are here to help others to receive eternal life, to enter the kingdom, and to be saved. If we ask many people if they want the kingdom, they will say yes. If we ask them if they want eternal life, they will also say yes. If we ask them if they want to be saved, they will say yes all the more. If, however, we ask if they want to be delivered from mammon, they will say no. A brother from a denomination came to our meetings, and said to my brother Hwai-zhu, "You are very good at fund-raising here at Hardoon Road." My brother asked why he was so interested in the saints' consecration. He answered, "I want to learn and observe a few more times. If your method works well, we will do the same in our denomination." This man only saw how money was offered. He did not see how we teach men to be delivered from mammon.</p><p>When Peter heard the Lord's word concerning a camel going through a needle's eye being easier than a rich man entering God's kingdom, he asked, "Then who can be saved?" He forgot that he himself was a camel, and that this camel, in fact, had passed through the needle's eye already. He forgot that there were eleven other camels who had done the same. While there is nothing harder than a rich man being saved, what is impossible with man is possible with God. The rich young ruler turned back. He was not a sinner or an evil man. He was charming and godly, yet he was not saved. Zaccheus was also a rich man. He was a slave of mammon, yet he was saved. He climbed up and down the tree. His going up and coming down undid him; it made him poor; nevertheless, he was saved. The young ruler is an example of what is "impossible with men," and Zaccheus is an example of what is "possible with God." A man experiences joy when his sins are forgiven. He experiences the same joy when he is delivered from mammon. When a man believes in the Lord, he finds peace in his heart. When mammon no longer occupies any place in him, he also finds peace in his heart. The receiving of eternal life is something that God accomplishes. Deliverance from mammon is also something that God accomplishes. Forgiveness of sins, the receiving of eternal life, and deliverance from mammon are all God's accomplishments. Peter asked, "Then who can be saved?" The Lord could have answered him, saying, "Zaccheus!" When God works in us, we will no longer remain a camel; we will be saved from mammon. Our salvation includes salvation from mammon. We should never leave out this item in our consideration of the sphere our salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Be Rich before the Lord</h2><p>Third, we have to learn to be rich before the Lord. He wants us to sell our all, but He does not want us to be in poverty. He wants us to learn to be rich in Him. As Christians, we are rich men, depending on the ground upon which we stand. In 1926 or 1927 I heard a pastor who said, "Today is New Year's Day. Everyone likes to greet others with the words, `Wishing you prosperity.' While a believer should not be prosperous, he should at least be modestly well-off." Actually, according to the Bible God wants us all to be rich before Him and poor before the world. Only those who are poor on earth can be rich before God. When we are asked to sell our all, we are not being asked to spend all of our money, but to transfer it from our earthly bank to the heavenly bank. We are being asked to change our deposit from one place to another. Selling our all is making a transfer and depositing our money in heaven. Christians can be foolish indeed. When God asks, "Do you believe that it is safe to keep your mammon in the Bank of Shanghai?", we will answer, "Yes." When God asks, "Do you believe in the heavenly bank?", we will answer, "No." We do not deposit our money in the heavenly bank simply because the interest is higher there. God does not attract us with interest. Our Father, the rich One, is able to pay us one hundred dollars interest for every dollar we deposit. Our heavenly bank has an interest rate of ten thousand percent. There is a profit of ten thousand percent. Today it would be sensational if a bank offered three percent interest for any deposit. However, God is asking whether we have faith. He offers a profit of ten thousand percent. Our money has been in the earthly bank. We can invest in an earthly bank, but will we invest in God's eternal bank? Do we want to deposit our money in an eternal account? We are here to serve God! If we see this, we will give our all for this. In the past we gave our all to mammon; we served it. Now we have to put everything on God's side and serve Him. We have to be those who are rich in God.</p><h2 class="head2">Selling One's All to Give to the Poor</h2><p>Fourth, in the Gospels the Lord dealt with mammon by ordering it to be given to the poor. During Pentecost the poor referred to those who were in the church, the household of the faith. When believers sell their all, they should lay the proceeds at the feet of the elders and the apostles, rather than give it immediately to the poor. On the one hand, we should distribute our wealth to the poor outside the church, and on the other hand, we should distribute it to those in the church. There is much benefit in taking care of the unbelieving poor; this can expand our heart's capacity. Today we have the church, and there are two distinct advantages to practicing giving in the church. First, the givers become men who are delivered from mammon. Second, the receivers are believing brothers and sisters. The Lord told men to sell their all because He did not want men to fall into the bondage of mammon. He wanted men to serve Him. The Lord did not say to keep the proceeds that one had received from selling his all in a safe place for two years because there would be no inflation in two years. The Lord cannot wait for two years. A Christian should never accumulate mammon. We have to consider mammon as a venomous snake; it is not simply a bug or an ant. We have to shake off mammon like Paul shook off the viper. It is for our own good that we sell our all.</p><p>The twelve apostles sold their all and gave up everything. At Pentecost, Peter did not give a message on giving one's all, but when the three thousand saw the twelve who had sold their all, they did the same thing. In Acts 4 another five thousand came in. They saw the three thousand who had sold their all, and they did the same thing. Those in the succeeding generation take their example from the previous generation. The five thousand followed the example of the three thousand, the three thousand followed the example of the twelve, and the twelve followed the example of Christ. What we hear can never match what we see. When men come to the church, we want them to see love and oneness, but they should also see that we have sold our all. If we do not set the standard right, the next generation will have no way to go on. Whatever we want our next generation to be, we have to be this in our generation. Today we are in the recovery; we are here to bear the responsibility of the recovery. May we be those who take the way of voluntary poverty. We hope that when the next generation meets again, there will be no need for them to discuss such things as buying land or building houses. Strictly speaking, there is no need to preach about selling one's all. We preach it today because such a practice was lost after Pentecost. We hope that we will not need to speak too much about this in the future. Of course, if the brothers and sisters will not sell their all, we will have to continue preaching this.</p><h2 class="head2">Continually Guarding Against Having "Excess"</h2><p>Fifth, we must uphold and maintain the practice of "He who gathered much had no excess" (2 Cor. 8:15). After we have handed over our all, we will gain new possessions gradually. We do not expect to gather much when we sow; we simply let go when we sow. Nevertheless, it is a fact that we will gather much. What then should we do? Second Corinthians 8 and 9 come after Acts 2 and 4, not before. In 2 Corinthians, we find the words He who gathered much had no excess. This is not a question of whether a man has sold his all, but a question of what a man does after he has sold his all. We have to empty ourselves of everything at least once, but as new income is received, we have to empty again. As God blesses us and increases our income, we surely have to pour out more. Those who sow abundantly should not be in excess. The more absolutely a person deals with the matter of mammon, the faster his money will come back to him. A brother once remarked, "We can never beat God in His work." God's emphasis is on "he who gathered much had no excess;" His emphasis is not on "he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap" (2 Cor. 9:6). This is not a matter of reaping with blessing, but a matter of not having excess. No matter how much income we receive, God wants us to maintain the practice of not having excess. We must deal with money in an absolute way. Before the Lord, we must continually give away our money.</p><p>The five points above concern a Christian's attitude towards money, as seen in the New Testament. This is our way of dealing with mammon. We have to deal with mammon in an absolute way. Today a Christian should begin his pathway of revival from his experience of deliverance from mammon. We have to be delivered from mammon.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO MANAGE THE OFFERING</h2><p>In the future, we have to learn from God's Word how we should handle our finances and how our private money should be separated from the work's money. We have a few guidelines concerning this for our co-workers when they set out for their work.</p><p>First, we should give to the brothers who are in want or to poor people in general.</p><p>Second, we should care for the needs of individual brothers and sisters. Those who are making the offering can write down the name of a certain brother on an envelope and drop it in the offering box in care of the responsible brothers.</p><p>Third, we should care for the need of our own church.</p><p>Fourth, we should care for the need of other churches.</p><p>Fifth, we should support the need of the work within our own region. Churches are local, while the work is regional. A few places combined together form a region. In the New Testament we find two regions of work&mdash;Jerusalem and Antioch. The twelve apostles had Jerusalem as their center. Paul and the other apostles had Antioch as their center. Paul said that they boasted according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure had apportioned to them (2 Cor. 10:13). For years we were clear about the locality being the sphere of a local church, but we were not clear about the work. Now finally we are clear. There are regions of work. The work in Samaria was under Jerusalem. The work in Pamphylia was under Antioch. This shows us clearly that there are regions of work. If there is not a clear distinction between the local church and the work, we will be confused as soon as there are some kind of shake-ups. We have to remember that the church is confined to a locality, while the work extends to a region. Elders are appointed for the care of the local churches, while apostles are raised up for the work of a region. The Bible is very clear about this. It is only man who is not clear about this.</p><p>Sixth, we should also take care of the need of other regions of work. A normal relationship should exist between various regions of work. Jerusalem and Antioch were not cut off one from the other. A relationship and a fellowship existed between them. Antioch was raised up by Barnabas, who came from Jerusalem. Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch and brought Paul to Jerusalem from Antioch. When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent relief. In Acts we find a close relationship between these two regions. They fellowshipped not only in spiritual matters but in material needs as well.</p><p>Presently, we have two regions of work in China&mdash;Foochow and Shanghai. After the eighth month of the Chinese calendar we hope to start the work in Tsingtao or Tientsin as well, linking Tsingtao with Shanghai. Following this we will move on to Kwangtung and Kwangsi through Canton. During the past few days, P'ing Yang in southern Chekiang as well as Swatow in Kwangtung have both had a start. There are twenty-six to twenty-seven counties around Swatow with brothers and sisters speaking the Hakka dialect. Therefore, the work among the Hakka people must be centered around Swatow. The work is regional. The failure in our work in the past was in making the work local. We have to consider our work from the perspective of the whole region. The workers have to bear more responsibility in such regions. Brother Witness Lee is bearing the responsibility of the work in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Ke-san is bearing the responsibility of the work in Foochow.</p><p>These are six different ways to handle our personal finances. Some people think that we are centralizing the management of finances and that we are turning over our money to the control of one person. We never have had such a thought in our mind.</p><h2 class="head1">WAYS TO DISPOSE OF MONEY<br />RECEIVED FROM THE LOCAL CHURCH</h2><p>There are also six ways to take care of money received from the local churches. First, we can remember the poor. Second, we can remember individual brothers and sisters or individual workers. Third, we can spend it on the local needs of the local church. Fourth, we can take care of the needs of other local churches. Fifth, we can take care of the needs of the work in our own region. Sixth, we can take care of the needs of the work of other regions.</p><h2 class="head1">WAYS TO DISPOSE OF MONEY<br />RECEIVED FROM THE REGION</h2><p>There are also six ways to take care of money received from the regions of work. First, we can use it on the poor within the region. Second, we can use it on individual workers within the region. Third, we can take care of the need of the work in the region. Fourth, we can take care of the need of the work in other regions. Fifth, we can take care of the churches within the region. Sixth, we can take care of the churches in other regions.</p><p>In handling the distribution of funds, we have an opportunity to experience God's guidance and the Spirit's discipline in many ways. This exercise requires faith, love, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Every worker must continue to look to the Lord and must continue to exercise faith. The personal walk of faith, which we spoke of in the past, is still necessary. However, in addition to this individual faith, we also need corporate faith. Individual needs must be met by individuals alone. For the church or the work to take care of such a need would only damage the faith of the individuals.</p><p>As to my personal needs, as well as the needs of the work directly under me, such as the expenses of this training, I will never receive anything from the local churches or the work.</p><p>In handing over one's possessions, we would like to see the matter conducted properly in the church. While we do not want anyone to exhibit his consecration, we do want men to testify of their experience. The church does not dictate how the brothers and sisters should dispose of their wealth; it can be done according to any of the above six ways. (This refers to the brothers and sisters who have handed themselves over to the church.) In order to have a proper testimony in this matter, we need witnesses. A believer acts for the purpose of testimony and fellowship, not for boasting. This is like the Lord's death; it was not a boasting, but a testimony. Worldly men, however, die for their friends for the purpose of boasting. In the Gospels the Lord said that we should not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing, but by the time of Acts things had changed. There must be a proper testimony. Of course, one does not publicize his acts with a loud gong. Our acceptance of the Lord and our faith in Him are mysteries, but baptism is a concrete step we take. When something is concrete, it is certain, like cement mixed with water. Love is abstract, but marriage is concrete. A person may experience a change in a hidden way, but when we ask this person to stand up to testify, his change becomes certain. Personally, I am disinclined to ask others to stand up. If anyone encourages men to stand up, however, I certainly have no objection to this exercise. Any concrete or "mechanical" act is sure and trustworthy. Spiritual things cannot remain spiritual; they have to become concrete and "mechanical." We may say that we are following the example of 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, but who knows how much we have offered up and how much we have held back? No one makes an audit of our account, and no one is there to be our accountant. The best thing for us to do is to make a public confession. Once we make a public confession, we turn our action into something concrete. Many people are visible when they walk in but become invisible when they walk out. Our Lord, however, came visibly and left visibly. It is wrong to walk in visibly and walk out invisibly. We have to pay attention to the "mechanical" side of things, not merely the spiritual side. Once we take care of the "mechanical" things, we make our actions concrete. For the sake of testimony in the conscience, we should make public confessions.</p><p>In summary, we have to see that the love of mammon and our service to it is the root of all sins. If a man tolerates mammon, it will be easy for him to indulge in the flesh. Wherever mammon is, there is pride and greed. We must be delivered absolutely from the influence of mammon.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A PRAYER FOR<br />NORTH CHINA AND MANCHURIA</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 3, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</h1><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, we believe that nothing is too difficult for You, though to us it may be impossible. You have Your people in Ch'ang-ch'un, Shen-yang (in Manchuria), and Tsinan. Do not allow them to go through more trials than they can bear. Give them days of peace that they may live in godliness and serve You. The great tribulation is not yet here, so we ask You to prevent the evil one from running loose on a rampage. We pray that the gospel will not be hindered in any way. Thank and praise You. You are the God who answers prayers. Thank and praise You. You are the victorious Lord. We ask that every inch and parcel of land be preserved and that Your children can serve You. The tribulation is not here yet. Now is not Satan's time; it is still our time. Satan may want to initiate something, but he will not succeed. We need Your help. During the past twenty or more years, we have not had much result in the work. But if You will give us another twenty years, we will fully give ourselves to the work. In the past the war prevented us from meeting together. After the war we thought that the days of trials were over, but now Satan has stirred up another war. Lord, grant us wisdom, and grant us a free and open way. All political powers are in Your hand. The victory is Yours, the victory is the church's, and the victory is ours.</p><p>Lord, the crumbs from Your table are better than the richest portions on our table. Be merciful to us and grant us more of Your crumbs.</p><h2 class="head1">A SHARING AT THE END OF THE PRAYER</h2><p>Victory and loss in political power are of little concern to us. We should change our attitude. We should not criticize, curse, or slander. As long as a regime does not forbid us from worshipping our God, we should bless it. Brother Witness Lee said that if a government is a hundred times worse, we should still pray for it.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class="title">RESURRECTION,<br />THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 13, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow<br />Scripture Reading:Acts 2:24-28, 31-34; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Eph. 1:19-23</h1><h2 class="head1">THREE SUBJECTS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>The Bible mainly speaks of three subjects. The first is resurrection, the second is the Holy Spirit, and the third is the church. The human mind cannot comprehend these three things because they are beyond human imagination and description. All three things are revealed to us by the Spirit of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S CREATION BEING INCOMPLETE</h2><p>In order to understand these things, we have to go back to Genesis. When man was created by God, he was created perfect, but not complete. Other forms of creatures were both perfect and complete, but man was perfect yet not complete. After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Man was free to choose between the two. This proves that God's creation of man was not complete. In God's eyes man was not complete. Even though man did not have the knowledge of good and evil, he needed God's life, as typified by the tree of life. When man was created, he was living, but he did not have God's life. He needed to take one more step. Man is not complete until he has God's life (typified by the tree of life). However, before man ate of the tree of life, he first ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He made the wrong choice and delayed his completion. Therefore, man has not reached the peak of his potential. In God's eyes man is still short of something. Today, even at his loftiest height, man is still short of God's glory. Man is limited, and even at his best he is still short. We can say that the whole Old Testament, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Malachi, is a development of the creation story; it is a continuation of God's creation. Although Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, etc., were good, they were still short in God's eyes; they were not able to reach God's original goal in His creation. Although they had God's image, they did not have His likeness. Image refers to the outward shape while likeness refers to inward character and disposition.</p><p>During the past six thousand years, God's work of creation in man has not stopped. God has made no advance as far as the creation of other species is concerned. He has not created more kinds of flowers, birds, horses, etc. These things were complete and perfect from the day they were created; there was no room for improvement, but man has never been completed. In Genesis 1:26 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." Man is created according to God's image and likeness. The word image signifies outward appearance; it does not refer to the inward nature. Adam was created a living soul. He did not have God's Spirit in him. Therefore, he was not complete; he was an unfinished piece. Adam needed God Himself, typified by the tree of life, to be his very nature.</p><p>Man did not reach God's standard at the time of Genesis. This went on until the time of the Lord Jesus. Adam had God's outward appearance, but he was not like God in his nature. When he fell, he came short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). He lost God's likeness. Before the Lord Jesus was incarnated, there was not a single man on earth up to the standard. Sages of past centuries have tried to reach the standard through their asceticism and stoic practices, but they are still short of God. There is a distinction between the Old Testament and the New Testament. In the Old Testament man did not reach God's goal. In the New Testament one man was after God's heart. He is the complete man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING THE ONLY COMPLETED MAN</h2><p>Thank the Lord! What God longed for in ages past, but did not find, is finally here in the New Testament. That man is Christ. In the Lord Jesus God found the man whom He was after. The Lord Jesus is the model man. Christ is not merely a representative of man; He is a representative man. He is the man whom God is after.</p><h2 class="head1">RESURRECTION</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for Resurrection</h2><p>While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was perfect in His character but not in His power. Our Lord was limited in power. This is the reason it was not enough for Him to live thirty-three and a half years. He needed to go through resurrection. This is something beyond our mental power of comprehension. Brothers and sisters, this is a tremendous matter, but it is useless to try to fathom it with the mind. Without revelation, no one will be interested in this subject, just as a village simpleton has no interest whatsoever in the atomic bomb. Why did the Lord need resurrection? He was limited in time and space on earth. Some who came and looked for Him had to remove a roof to reach Him (Mark 2:1-4). One had to press against the crowd to touch the hem of His garment (5:24-27). The centurion was an exception; he had a faith that bypassed the pressing of the crowd. The Lord commended his faith as being great. His servant was ill, and he asked the Lord to say a word so that his servant would be healed (Luke 7:6-10). The centurion's word, in effect, acknowledged that the Lord was beyond time and space. His servant was immediately healed. Here was a man who had revelation. The Lord was conceived through the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:35). As far as His character was concerned, He was the pinnacle of God's creation of man. Yet as far as His power was concerned, He was still limited. This is the reason there is the need of resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">Resurrection Securing for God<br />the Representative Man</h2><p>Let us consider the meaning of resurrection. Resurrection means that God has secured a representative man for Himself. Hebrews 1:5 says, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You." According to Acts 13:33, this verse refers to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Resurrection means that the model man Jesus is now no longer bound by anything. He lives now for eternity. The Lord's resurrection broke all the barriers of the natural realm. First Peter 1:3 says that we are saved and regenerated through His resurrection. There was the possibility of the Lord's death when He lived on the earth, but after His resurrection, death was destroyed, and He lives forever and ever. The potential and the power of death were forever destroyed.</p><p>Hallelujah! God worked on man for four thousand years. The man He sought after is finally here. God declared to the Lord Jesus at His resurrection, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You" (Acts 13:33). He did not declare this in Bethlehem at the Lord's birth. It was after the Lord's resurrection from the dead that God pronounced with joy, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You." Through the Lord's resurrection God secured the man He wants.</p><h2 class="head2">Resurrection Annulling<br />the Limitation of Time and Space</h2><p>What is the meaning of resurrection? It means that a man has broken through all barriers, even the greatest barrier of all&mdash;death. All barriers were destroyed through the Lord Jesus in His resurrection. The New Testament speaks a few times of the raising of the dead. For example, there were the widow's son in Nain (Luke 7:11-15), the daughter of Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue (Matt. 9:18-25), and Lazarus (John 11). However, even the raising of Lazarus was merely a kind of coming back to life or resuscitation. He was bound by grave clothes and would not have been able to walk if others had not loosed him. Eventually, Lazarus still died. Only the Lord's resurrection was a total destruction of death. When He resurrected, He faced death no longer. The Bible shows us that only the Lord is resurrection. Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said in reference to the Lord's resurrection that with Him there is no such thing as coming and going. With Him there is only a matter of appearing and disappearing. He does not come; He appears. He does not go; He disappears. It is no longer a question of coming and going but of being visible or not visible. In John 20:16-17, on the morning of His resurrection, the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him because He was not the same as before. As for Thomas's touching His side, it was a matter of faith. He wanted Thomas to touch in faith. It is possible to touch the resurrected Lord by faith. It is not a matter of coming and going with the resurrected Lord; it is altogether a matter of revelation. Man's biggest limitations are time and space, but these two things cannot limit the Lord. Resurrection means that all limitations have been broken. Hallelujah, our Lord Jesus is no longer bound by anything today! As long as we live in the Holy Spirit, we can touch the Lord. The Lord is in our midst, and all barriers are broken.</p><p>The Lord journeyed from beyond the Jordan to Judea after Lazarus died. When He arrived, Martha said, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died." The Lord said, "Your brother will rise again." She answered, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day" (John 11:21-24). The Lord immediately replied, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live....Do you believe this?" (vv. 25-26). In effect, the Lord was saying, "I am the last day! If you believe into Me, you will see resurrection now. Wherever I am, time no longer exists, and the `last day' no longer exists." As soon as resurrection comes in, the element of time is over. If resurrection is absent, time is a big factor, but wherever resurrection is, time is no longer an issue because resurrection is not bound by time.</p><p>Moreover, resurrection is not bound by space either. The two disciples on the way to Emmaus saw the resurrected Lord, but the disciples in Jerusalem also saw Him on the same day (Luke 24:13-35). When the Son of God resurrected, He transcended geography and time. In His resurrection there is no such thing as a sequence of time. He does not have a time schedule for His work. He does not have to wait three or five years for something to happen. The matter of time and space no longer exists. Today everyone on the whole earth can touch Him at the same time.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of Resurrection Being<br />the Greatest Power</h2><p>The greatest limitation on earth is death; nothing can extend beyond the confines of death. Death is the ultimate limitation of all living creatures. However, when the Lord resurrected, He destroyed this sepulchral limitation. Death is the greatest limitation, but resurrection has conquered death. Therefore, resurrection is the greatest power of all. We began talking about resurrection as early as 1926. But even now we are only touching the hem of the resurrected Lord's garment; we are still far off. If we can touch a little more, we will transcend death and everything else. This is the greatest power of all. Once we touch the power of resurrection, it will be easy to spread the gospel of the kingdom to all of China. Resurrection power is the greatest of all powers.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><h2 class="head2">Transmitting the Resurrected Lord</h2><p>What then is the Holy Spirit? In Acts 2:33 Peter preached the gospel to the Jews. He told them that the Lord was exalted to the right hand of God, had received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, and had poured out this Spirit on men. Therefore, the power of the Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection. This means that the Lord installed the power of resurrection and even resurrection itself into the Holy Spirit when He sent this Spirit to us. As soon as a man touches the Holy Spirit, he touches resurrection. Once a man is in the Spirit, he touches the Lord of resurrection. The Holy Spirit testifies to the resurrection of the Lord. While the Lord was on the earth, some leaned on His bosom. Others kissed Him, pressed upon Him, or received from His hands. He washed the feet and touched the hands of many. It was possible to touch the Lord then. However, this kind of touch cannot compare with our touch today. Today we are not bound by time and space. The resurrected Lord is now in the Holy Spirit. What we see today far exceeds what men saw then. The church has been able to go on continuously for two thousand years because men have inwardly seen the Lord in a clear way. Outwardly we do not see as clearly as the men in the four Gospels, but inwardly our knowledge of the Lord far exceeds that of those in the four Gospels. Once we are in the Spirit, we touch the resurrected Lord. The single, most important work of the Holy Spirit today is to transmit the resurrected Lord to men. The Holy Spirit is not transmitting the Christ of the Gospels to men, but the Christ in resurrection. When men saw the Lord on earth, they could only tell how tall He was, how wise He was, or how old He looked. Some could say that they saw Him when He was twelve or that they knew His brothers. However, we who are in the Holy Spirit today are not bound by time and space. We are touching the Christ who is not limited by time and space.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of Resurrection Being<br />in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The Lord has transcended all barriers. Today the Holy Spirit is here to testify of this transcendent Christ. If a man claims to know the Holy Spirit yet does not know the transcendency of the resurrected Christ, he does not know the Christ in the Holy Spirit. The power of resurrection is in the Holy Spirit. Ephesians 1:21 says that when the resurrected Christ was uplifted, He transcended all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come. God made the resurrected Christ to sit at His right hand and exalted Him to a place that is far beyond human understanding. He has transcended all the names that man can name, not only in this age but also in the age that is coming. Resurrection means the breaking down of all barriers. Only the self-existing and ever-existing One can transcend all, yet God decrees that even those who are not self-existing and ever-existing can transcend all as well. The work of the Holy Spirit today is to reveal this resurrection power to us. We have to see that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection. The Spirit that transcends everything is the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Power of Resurrection Being Deposited<br />in the Church and Operating in the Church</h2><p>Let us move on to the church. What is the church? The church is where the Lord is the Head and we are the Body. What is the relationship between the church and resurrection, and what is the relationship between the church and the Holy Spirit? Ephesians 1:19-20 speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power which God caused to operate in Christ. The church is the place where God demonstrates the operation of the might of His strength, according to the power which He caused to operate in Christ. We have to pay attention to the words according to. They mean that God is causing the same degree of might and strength that operated in Christ to now operate in the church. Those who have might do not necessarily have strength, and those who have strength do not necessarily have might, but here we have "the might of His strength." The same might of strength which God caused to operate in Christ is now similarly operating in the church. The church can now experience the same might and strength that the Lord experienced. The church is the same as the resurrected Lord not only in nature but also in power. If this were not so, everything about the church would be vanity. Just as God broke through all barriers in the Lord, He is breaking through all barriers in the church. Therefore, the church should be the same as the resurrected Lord. It should be as powerful, as free, and as unfettered by any limitation as the Lord is. Otherwise, it cannot be called the church. The might of God's strength not only operated in Christ, but it continually operates in the church as well. Today the church is the depository and storehouse of the power of resurrection. This is the church. Anything less than this will not do. The church is the Body of Christ. Therefore, this might and strength cannot be anything less than they should be.</p><p>Following verses 19 and 20, verse 22 says that God has not only caused Christ to rise from the dead and to transcend all things but that He has also "subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church." He is resurrected, and He is in glory. He is no longer a humble Nazarene, but the victorious Christ. All things are under His feet today. When the Lord was on earth, He was a perfect man, but He was not yet the Head of the church. He was the Head but not the glorified Head. At that time death was not yet totally annulled. Many Bible teachers in their foolishness insist on finding the church in the four Gospels, but no one can find the church in the four Gospels, because Jesus in the four Gospels was a limited man. If there was only this first portion of the Word, the church would only be a limited and finite institution. We may think that the Lord's power and authority on earth were great enough, but God said that this was not enough. He had to pass through death and resurrection, and the Holy Spirit had to come before He could commit the power of resurrection to the church. Today the church has received this power supply from the ascended and glorified Christ. Therefore, there is no problem that the church cannot solve and no temptation that the church cannot overcome because the power of the church is the resurrection power of Christ, the same power that subjected all things under His feet. It is no less than the very power that operated in Christ.</p><p>When the Lord was on the earth, there was no church, because Christ was not yet resurrected; everything was bound. The church was produced after Christ rose from the dead, ascended to the height, and poured forth the Holy Spirit. The church became the Body of Christ after the Lord's resurrection. The church is filled with all that He is; it is the very vessel which holds the resurrected Christ. This is the meaning of the church. The Lord Jesus has passed through everything and has inherited everything. Nevertheless, He is only the Head. The church is His Body; it bears His characteristics. The church is what Christ is in Himself. Just as Christ is unlimited, the church is also unlimited. Nothing can match the relationship between Christ and the church. The body is the best analogy because the head and all the members share the same life and bear the same characteristics. If I make a chair, I can make it without one leg, but the Body of Christ cannot be short of a leg.</p><h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit Manifesting<br />the Resurrection Power of Christ<br />through the Church</h2><p>We believers were given to drink one Spirit. This Spirit constitutes us the one Body of Christ. Therefore, when two persons on earth touch the resurrection of Christ, whatever they bind will be bound and whatever they loose will be loosed (Matt. 18:18-20). The minimum number for the church to function is two. If two persons touch the power of resurrection and stand on resurrection ground, everything will have to obey them and go along with them. In the past the church did not know this. Perhaps we have to go through many years before we experience this, but now we know what the church is. Once we know the church, all problems go away in an instant. We might have had a hard problem in the past which we could not overcome personally. Now our problems are settled in an instant. Today the church is the depository of the resurrection power of Christ. What is the Holy Spirit doing today? He is manifesting the resurrection power of Christ through the church. All the problems are over now. The Lord said that the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. Personally, I believe that the gates here refer to all the gates of Hades. They are all open to the church, and they cannot prevail against the church because Hades represents death, and the church represents resurrection. This is the reason the church is victorious. Whether or not the Lord has a way on earth today is not a matter of changing our behavior or knowing some truth. Some must be ready to pay the price to know resurrection, to know the Holy Spirit, and to know the church. When we know these things, the church will have a glorious testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICE</h2><p>Practically speaking, every one of us has touched a little resurrection at one time or another. Personal salvation is an example of the operation of resurrection. But the power of resurrection can do more: A man is able to suffer for the Lord or even to die and be martyred for Him. First Corinthians 15 speaks of the truth of resurrection. Verse 58 concludes with us abounding in the work of the Lord. The power which sustains us in such a work is the power of resurrection. A man also can bear the cross, receive spiritual training, see light, and be sanctified through the power of resurrection.</p><p>Throughout the last two thousand years this truth has been released a little here and a little there. Today the truth is revealed in its present advanced stage. It is a great thing when a person stands on resurrection ground today. I feel that we have not seen enough of the Lord's resurrection today. He is powerful to subdue everything and to transcend everything. Yet by Himself He is only the Head. The amazing thing, however, is that the Lord wants to become one with us. This corporate man is not limited by anything; he is able to manifest God's power. This is too great a thing. Unless we know this revelation and bear this testimony, we cannot make any progress. We will save ourselves much time and energy if we receive some light from the Lord and have our eyes opened to this fact. May the Lord be merciful to us and open our eyes to see resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">RESURRECTION,<br />THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 20, 1948<br />Place:Customs Lane, Foochow<br />Scripture Reading:Eph. 1:19</h1><h2 class="head1">DEATH BEING THE GREATEST LIMITATION</h2><p>Last Lord's Day we spoke about resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and the church. Today I will add a few words based on our Scripture reading. Last Lord's Day we saw how death is a great limitation. I have to repeat and emphasize this point. All living creatures meet their end when they die. Death is the greatest limitation to a living organism. A small animal ceases to exist when it dies. A large animal also ceases to exist when it dies. Every living organism, whether it is a plant or an animal, is limited by death. The same is true with man. Even if a man's mind becomes more clever than it is today and even if he makes plans for himself like the rich man in the Lord's parable, whom God called "foolish," he is finished once God calls for his soul (Luke 12:16-21). All of our loved ones, our father, mother, and children, are gone once they die. No one can call them back. This can be said of all the great men of this world. No matter how powerful they are and what position they hold, they are finished once they die. Death is the greatest limitation.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD BEING AFTER A MAN OF RESURRECTION</h2><p>When the Lord was on the earth, He was a prototype of all men. He was a prototype during the first forty days after His resurrection. During the thirty-three and a half years He lived on the earth, He was a prototype of human moral virtues. During the forty days after His resurrection, He was a prototype of power. These forty days speak of His power. For years orthodox theology has acknowledged that the earthly Lord Jesus is a pattern. It views the Lord's death as a satisfaction of God's requirement, without which God would condemn us for our sins. We failed and were under God's condemnation. Unless the Lord died for us and the veil of the Holy of Holies was rent for us, we would never have been saved. We would be condemned instead. However, theologians in the past have not seen the truth of Christ's resurrection. Only after 1926 did men begin to see the truth about resurrection. Only He who passed through resurrection can fulfill God's plan. Hebrews 1:5 says, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You." This word refers to the Lord's ascent from the grave. After His resurrection, the Lord rose from the grave, and God said to Him, "This day have I begotten You." When God said, "This day have I begotten You," He had found the man He was after.</p><p>Therefore, we became God's sons on the day of the Lord's resurrection. Since the fall, man has come short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). Unless we pass through resurrection, we cannot be saved. We have come short of God's glory. The Lord is the only One who has not come short of His glory. The Lord is the only perfect man, but God needs something more than a perfect man. He has an additional demand: Such a perfect man must also be a man of power. God's need is not only a moral man but a man of power. Since His birth at Bethlehem, the Lord was a moral man. But after His resurrection, He was manifested to be a man of power. After His resurrection, He became omnipresent. Time and space could limit Him no longer. He became a man endowed with resurrection power. He is now the man God wants, and God's plan of creating man is fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head1">RESURRECTION TRANSCENDING EVERYTHING</h2><p>After the Lord resurrected, time and space were no longer constraints to Him. Death could not contain Him. Through His resurrection He broke the barrier of death. Lazarus's resurrection was different from the Lord's resurrection. The former was only a kind of resuscitation to life; it was not actually a resurrection. Lazarus was not able to break even the bondage of his grave clothes. In the end he still had to go through death. The limitation of death still remained with him. When the Lord resurrected, however, He broke the barrier of death. He passed through death but was not held by death (Acts 2:24). The gates of Hades could not stop Him; they could not swallow Him. He resurrected, and He will die no more. Death has no power or leverage over Him. When the Lord resurrected, not even His disciples like Peter and Thomas could believe it. When Mary the Magdalene went and told Peter and John about the Lord's disappearance from the grave, the two disciples went to look for Him. They only found the linen cloths and the handkerchief which had been over His head folded up in one place; however, the Lord was not there (John 20:1-8). It was like a man who had put on his coat and buttoned it, but who had disappeared out of it altogether! When Lazarus resurrected, he was still wrapped up in his linen cloths and handkerchief; he was still bound and limited. When the Lord resurrected, He left the linen cloths and the handkerchief behind. This means that He transcended all barriers. The Lord's resurrection was fundamentally different from Lazarus's resurrection.</p><p>Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said two things about the Lord in His resurrection: He does not come, but He appears. Neither does He go away, but He disappears. When the Lord resurrected, nothing could hold Him back. He is not limited by death, and He has broken all barriers of time and space. This is not all. God has exalted Him to the highest, and He has given Him a name that is above all names, not only in this age but in the age to come (Eph. 1:20-21). Our Christ has transcended everything in resurrection. Today the Lord is leading us to be as perfect morally as He is as a man. At the same time, He is leading us to experience as much of the power of resurrection as He experienced after His death. God is after a man who is perfect both in moral virtues as well as in power.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AFTER THE LORD'S RESURRECTION&mdash;<br />BORN OF THE SPIRIT TO BE<br />THE BODY OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST,<br />BEING ONE WITH THE HEAD</h2><p>Christ became the Head of the church after His resurrection. Before resurrection, in His status as a man, the Lord was not the Head of the church. After resurrection, when He ascended to the Father, received from the Father the promised Spirit, and poured Him out to men, the church was produced. The Lord resurrected to be the Head to the church. Moreover, He has joined us together to be the one Body. Modern biologists can reconstruct the model of an entire animal from a single bone. Today God has made the Lord Jesus the Head, and He has made us His Body. Therefore, the nature of the Head becomes the nature of the Body. God's Word shows us that just as the Lord is in resurrection, the church is in resurrection. What then is the church? It is that which is impregnated in the resurrection of Christ.</p><p>The church is built upon the ground of resurrection. Without this, the church is not the church. Ephesians 1:19 speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. This power is the resurrection power manifested by God in Christ through His resurrection from the dead. Today the same resurrection power is operating within us. When this power operated in Christ, it made Him the Head. When this power operates in us, it makes us the Body. This is the church. Therefore, unless we experience the resurrection power of Christ, we do not know what the church is. The church is the same as Christ is in resurrection; it should be as unlimited and as victorious over everything as Christ is.</p><p>We say that Ephesians contains the highest truth in the Bible because it shows us the Body of Christ. In nature and in power, the Body of Christ is the same as Christ. In order for us to know the Body of Christ, we need revelation. Without this, the Body will only be a term to us. In our experience, we need to stand on the ground of the church. At least two persons have to come together to touch the resurrection power of the Lord and to pray in one accord. The Lord's Word says clearly that all authority in heaven and on earth is given to Him. Today the Lord wants us to execute this authority (Matt. 28:18-20) because we are His Body. Other than having an earthly body, there is no difference between us and the Lord; we are the same as He is spiritually. This is indeed a great thing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</h2><p>Once we see resurrection, we will know what the Body is. After the Lord resurrected, He poured out the Holy Spirit and produced the church. Through this act He became the Head, and the church became His Body. How great the Body is! No thought can be higher than the thought of accepting another person as a member of one's own body. The Lord Jesus has accepted us as His members, and He has given us His authority. We can freely use it now. How high and transcendent He is!</p><p>Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said that the work of the Holy Spirit is the operation of the power of the Lord's resurrection. Unless a work bears the mark of the operation of the Lord's resurrection power, it cannot be called a work of the Spirit. This matter is truly beyond man's mental apprehension. We have to pray for a spirit of wisdom and revelation. We need a revelation today to see the power that God has granted to us. As long as two or three see this revelation and stand on resurrection ground to pray in one accord, they will execute heavenly authority.</p><p>Hallelujah, we do not need anything more than what we already have! All we need to see is the glory, the riches, and the vastness of what we already possess. The authority in heaven is glorious and great, but it is limited by the earth. As long as there are two persons on earth who know resurrection and who stand on resurrection ground today, they will shake the ends of the earth. Presently, we have only touched the hem of the garment of resurrection. The Lord has released His speaking on resurrection to us in these years. Praise Him! What He has given us is the topmost portion; there cannot be any further improvement because we have become the same as the Lord. This matter rests entirely on our seeing today. May we all pray humbly before God, saying, "O Lord, grant me a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that I can see."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 19, 1948<br />Place:Kuling Mountain</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING THE UNIVERSE<br />AND RULING OVER IT BY AUTHORITY</h2><p>Beginning from today we will look at the matter of authority. Why do we need to consider the matter of authority? First, we must know that God's acts are based upon His throne, and His throne is built on authority. All things were created through God's authority. All natural laws function according to God's authority. God did not create the universe with power, but with authority. He does not uphold the natural laws by power, but by authority. Scientists today have discovered atomic power. Actually, what they have discovered is God's power. Their discovery is merely an unveiling of the laws of nature. According to Hebrews 1:3 God upholds all things by His word, which relates to His authority. God upholds all things by His authority, not by His power. God's authority ensures the constancy of the natural laws in this universe. He created the universe with His authority, and He rules the universe with His authority. God's authority represents God Himself. Looking at the matter in another way, we can say that God is the embodiment of authority. God is also the embodiment of power; He is the embodiment of authority as well as power. It is easy for man to be forgiven when he only offends God's power. It is not easy for him to be forgiven if he offends God's authority. It is a serious thing for a man to offend God's authority. Brothers and sisters, we have to see that authority is the unchanging factor that rules and stabilizes the universe from the beginning of time to its end. Everything in the universe, from the highest design to the lowest form, is upheld by God's authority. From creation, only one thing involves man all the time&mdash;authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</h2><p>Satan became who he is through offending God's authority. Satan is not the one who wrestled with God, but the one who trespassed against His authority. He tried to establish his own throne and rebelled against God's authority and throne. This caused him to become Satan. Isaiah 13 and 14 tell us that Satan wanted to establish his throne above God's throne. This is how he became Satan. The cause of his fall was his challenge of God's authority. He fell and became Satan not only because he committed the many sins spoken of in Ezekiel 28; the root of Satan's sin was his rebellion against God's authority. Satan did not sin and then rebel against God's authority; rather, he trespassed against God's authority and then fell and sinned. He fell because of his trespass against God's authority. This is the principle of Satan's operation&mdash;transgression against God's authority.</p><h2 class="head1">IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO SERVE GOD<br />IN THE PRINCIPLE OF SATAN</h2><p>This shows us clearly that in order to serve God, we cannot trespass His authority. Once we do, we fall under Satan's principle. Either we do not serve God at all or we have to come to terms with the vital place of authority. The first thing we should touch is authority, because authority is the basic rule upon which God governs the universe. We can never harbor any satanic principle of rebellion against authority within us while outwardly serving God. If a man has never been delivered from this satanic principle and if there is still a vestige within him of the principle which led to Satan's enmity against God, the principle which led to Satan's very rebellion, we can never serve God. We can never preach the word of Christ in the principle of Satan. Principle is more important than words. In this universe Satan is not afraid of those who preach Christ's word; he is afraid of those who submit to Christ's authority. Satan is still lodging in the air today. He is rebellious and blasphemous. He should have been cast out of heaven into the bottomless pit already, but he is lingering until the church will obey Christ. This will happen at the end of Revelation. Then Satan will be completely defeated. However, we have to rid ourselves of Satan's principle today. If a man has not rid himself of Satan's principle, he can only preach Satan's word; he cannot preach the word of Christ. Unless God's authority and our submission are fully manifested, we can make many claims about doing God's work, but we are doing Satan's work in actuality. For example, a man may have been in Chungking (the seat of the Chinese government) during the last war, but he may have been working for Nanking (the headquarters of the Japanese occupying army). Submission to authority is a matter of principle, while preaching is merely a matter of work. Principle is more important than work. We have to settle the matter of principle here.</p><p>In Matthew 6:13a the Lord taught the disciples to pray, "Do not bring us into temptation." He does not want to see us falling because of temptation. He also said, "Deliver us from the evil one" (v. 13b). Temptation refers to Satan's work, while the evil one refers to Satan himself. The Lord wants us to pray to be delivered from Satan's work as well as from Satan himself. We pray for God's deliverance from these two things: Satan's work and Satan himself. Following this we read, "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever" (v. 13c). We have to ask God to deliver us from temptation and ask Him to deliver us from Satan himself because the kingdom, the authority, and the glory are all the Lord's; they do not belong to Satan. In this universe, the unique controversy between Satan and God is the matter of authority. The Lord wants us to pray to be delivered from Satan and his work. We must not fall under Satan's authority or his principle. The kingdom, the authority, and the glory are all God's; they do not belong to Satan. This is the reason we have to be delivered from temptation and from the evil one. There are three basic things in the universe: the kingdom, the authority, and the glory. The kingdom belongs to God. So do the authority and the glory. None of these three things belong to Satan. The kingdom of the world today, the authority of the universe, and the glory of all things to come are not altogether the Lord's yet. However, the day will come when the kingdom, authority, and glory will be God's. Today in the church we should take back authority from Satan. We do not recognize the many kingdoms on the earth today. We only recognize the kingdom of the heavens. We have to be under God's rule. We should only acknowledge God's authority. We cannot rob His glory. All glory should go to God.</p><p>If you are here to pick up a teaching about authority, you are in the wrong place. Instead, you must pick up the proper sense&mdash;the sense of God's authority. You have to touch His authority and submit to it. Everything depends on whether or not you are under God's authority. You may have done many good works, but they do not mean much. God cares about your submission to His authority. The controversy in the universe involves the principle of authority. The entire issue today is who has the authority: God or Satan. Satan established his authority through rebelling against God's authority. This is Satan's government. Are we under Satan's government or are we under God's government? This is the crux of the whole issue.</p><h2 class="head1">FIRST TOUCHING AUTHORITY<br />THEN TOUCHING THE PERSON</h2><p>When we think about authority, the first thing that comes to our mind should not be the person. We should only think of authority, not the person involved. We should only be related to authority, not to the person involved. If we set our mind on the person before we consider submission itself, we do not know the meaning of authority. A servant of God must first touch authority before he touches the person. It is wrong to touch the person and then to touch authority. The right way is to first touch authority, being dislodged and conquered by it, instead of being occupied by the object of submission. It is not hard to submit this way. However, if a man submits to authority only after he has touched the person, his submission is not genuine. God has not broken through in such a person. We are not submitting to men, but to the authority which God places in men.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S GREATEST REQUIREMENT<br />BEING SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</h2><p>Of all the commandments which the Bible places before men, the greatest is not the bearing of the cross, offerings, consecration, or sacrifices. The greatest and highest demand in the entire Bible is the demand for submission to authority. Man regards such things as offerings, consecration, and sacrifices as the greatest things, considering them to be the most that a Christian can offer. When many people meet young Christians, their natural inclination is to exhort the latter to give themselves to these things, but please remember that the greatest demand in the Bible is the demand to submit to authority. First Samuel 15:22b says, "To obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams." This means that the most basic requirement in the Bible is obedience. Obedience is more basic and crucial than sacrifice. The other side of obedience is authority. Offerings, consecration, and sacrifices may all be contaminated by self-will. Only obedience is not contaminated by self-will because obedience shuts out the self. We should obey whether or not things go our way. We should submit whether or not we are willing. We have to see that the bearing of the cross is not our highest obligation to God's will; submission to authority is.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S PRAYER<br />IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE</h2><p>A few years ago I spoke in Shanghai on the Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane. Today I would like to speak on this again. Some have the thought that the Lord's prayer, in which His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground, was the result of the weakness of His flesh (Luke 22:44). They have the thought that He acted in this way because He was afraid of the cup. Nothing can be further from the truth. While He was praying in the garden of Gethsemane, the cup and God's will were two different things. This is the reason He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me" (Matt. 26:39). He did not say that He would not do the Father's will. He only asked that the "cup" be removed from Him if possible. He did not ask for God's will to be removed. At this point God's will was something absolute, while the cup was not yet something that was absolute. God's will is an expression of His authority. Before the Father revealed Himself clearly to the Lord, the Lord did not equate the cup with His will. Obedience is not the same as sacrifice, and taking heed is not the same as the fat of rams. There was a time when the cup and God's will were two things. This is the reason the Lord prayed to know God's will. He did not drink the cup simply because it was the cup. He had to wait until the cup and God's will became one thing before He could say, "The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). Once He became clear that the cup was God's will, He readily drank it. Therefore, the Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was for the purpose of determining the relationship between the cup and God's will. The Lord wanted to know if it was God's will for Him to go to the cross. He did not hold to the cross; He held to God's will. The prayer in Gethsemane contains a very deep thought, much deeper than human apprehension. The Lord went to the cross for the sake of accomplishing God's will. His crucifixion was the highest expression of His submission to authority. We have to realize that even with the cross, there was the possibility of a mistake. However, there could never be any mistake with God's will. When the Lord became clear that the cross and God's will were one and the same, He chose the cross without hesitation. Therefore, His crucifixion was an act of submission to God's will. Here we find the Lord upholding God's authority. He was not upholding His act of crucifixion. Crucifixion is not the highest goal; the accomplishment of God's will is. This is the reason Hebrews 10:7 tells us that when Christ came to the earth, He said, "I have come...to do Your will, O God." The Lord is truly our pattern! In our service to the Lord, we should act according to God's will, not according to our will.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR GOD'S SERVANT TO HAVE<br />A GENUINE TOUCH WITH AUTHORITY</h2><p>In working for the Lord, we are God's servants. As servants, the first thing we should touch is the authority of the Master. Those whose eyes are set on men have never touched authority. As ministers of God, being in line with the authority of the Head is the first principle we have to keep. Naturally, we were all under the principle of rebellion. In order to serve God, we have to be confronted by His authority in a definite way. We have to come into His presence and meet His authority face to face. We have to be wounded and defeated by this encounter. We have to be humbled by authority and face it in a genuine way. This experience has to be as real as our experience of salvation. This is the only way for us to be ushered into His service. Before we can participate in His work, we must touch authority in a definite way once. In our relationship with God, one controversy&mdash;whether or not we have touched His authority&mdash;remains. Once we touch authority, we will sense it everywhere. We do not ask others to obey us. Those who know authority will never have a problem with men. When I was in Shanghai someone asked me concerning the matter of submission: "What if God's deputy authority is wrong? What if my inner being cannot respond to the words of a deputy authority?" Those who ask such a question show that they have a fundamental problem. Will a person give up a fish simply because he has found bones in it or give up a bowl of rice simply because he has found a husk in it? Those who ask such questions have their eyes on men, not on authority. We are contending for the reality of the presence of God and an encounter with His authority. This encounter has to produce wounds and brokenness. This is the only way for us to be humbled. Unless there is such an encounter, our problems will never go away, not even if Paul, Peter, Solomon, and David came to our aid.</p><p>A brother in Shanghai once said to me, "Brother Nee, now I see authority. From now on I will obey whatever you say." When I heard this, I said to Brother Lee, "Terrible! He wants to obey me. That is a big mistake." No mistake in this world is greater than this one. Man thinks that obedience is going along with a certain person. If our mind is set on men all the time and if our thoughts are set on obeying men's words all the time, we are on the wrong track. If we constantly expect others to obey us, we are also wrong. If we think this way, we are only touching men; we have not touched authority. I would like to ask a question: "Have we touched the Lord's authority as definitely as we touched Him at the time of our salvation?" If we have not, everything we have is a deception; we are merely acting out our Christian life.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to be brought to the point where we can say that there is such a thing in this universe as authority and that we have touched it and have been wounded by it, just as a man is wounded when he hits the wall with his head. If we can say this, we will have the proper feeling the next time we touch authority. We will have the proper judgment within, and we will not be careless in any way. We will know that we are touching authority, not men. If we only touch men, we may obey when these men are around. As soon as they are gone, however, we will assume our throne again. Some people are only afraid of certain brothers and sisters. When these brothers and sisters are not around, they feel free to do anything. However, if a man has truly touched authority, he will not behave this way. Even if the persons he is afraid of are gone, God's authority will still be present. If a man has touched authority in one place, he will touch authority in every place. Authority fills the whole universe. It fills the world as well as the church. The most perfect manifestation of authority is in the church. Once we find authority in the church, we find headship, we find speaking that represents headship, and we find obedience that issues from this headship. If anyone does not obey this headship, he has not seen God's appointed authority.</p><p>The fundamental problem in our service is that we obey men rather than authority. In Foochow there were two brothers who would obey only me but no one else. These brothers had not touched authority. It was equally wrong for them to obey me and for them to not obey others. It is useless for a man to listen to and to obey others if he has never touched God's authority. We are not here to obey men, but to submit to authority. You have been a Christian for many years. Now you are giving yourself to serve the Lord. If you have never touched God's authority, how can you serve Him? Those who know authority sense it wherever it may be. Those who do not know authority are selective in their obedience. Such a selection will not occur with those who know authority. Everyone who knows authority is enlightened before God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS' JUDGMENT AND PAUL'S JUDGMENT</h2><p>Matthew 26 tells us that the Lord suffered two kinds of judgment after His arrest. The first was a religious judgment before the high priest. The other was a political judgment before Pilate. When asked by Pilate, the Lord Jesus did not answer anything because He was not under any earthly government. When asked by the high priest, He was initially silent, but when the high priest challenged Him by the name of the living God, saying, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God," He answered, "You have said rightly." The religious court condemned Him based on this word (vv. 62-64). Why did the Lord decide to answer after His initial silence? This was because authority was involved. The Lord had to answer. It was not a matter of whether or not He needed to answer the high priest. It was a matter of what the high priest had touched upon; his question touched upon God's authority.</p><p>Consider Paul's judgment in Acts 23. Pay particular attention to his change in attitude. He was a person thoroughly dealt with by the Lord and was able to say a strong word to the Sanhedrin: "Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day" (v. 1). At that time Paul had difficulty with his eyes. He could not see well, and he did not realize that the high priest was there. When the high priest ordered those standing by Paul to strike him on the mouth, Paul said, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck?" (v. 3). Paul was prophesying as well as reasoning. He was saying that it was unreasonable for a man to be struck before he is judged. He did not realize that the chairman of the Sanhedrin was the high priest. When those around him rebuked him, saying, "Do you revile the high priest of God?", he realized that the high priest was the chairman, and he humbled himself and said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, `You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people'" (vv. 4-5). Following this, in verse 6, Paul changed the tone of his conversation and no longer spoke as an apostle. Here we see a man softening himself as soon as he touched authority. Paul touched the authority of the high priest of God. He could not speak to the high priest as if he was standing in God's place. On the one hand, Paul could consider himself equal with any king of the world; no one was greater than he was. He was God's ambassador. Yet as soon as he touched God's authority, he humbled himself. When he found out that Ananias was God's high priest, he immediately humbled himself and subjected himself to authority.</p><p>As workers of the Lord, we must come face to face with authority. Unless we do this, the principle governing our work will not be the principle of submission, but the principle of satanic rebellion. We have to see God's authority. Otherwise, we will be selective in our obedience. When we think that a certain person deserves obedience, we will obey him. When we think that he does not deserve obedience, we will not obey him. This is absolutely wrong. We must have a head-on encounter with authority at least once, before we know what authority really is. Nothing in this world is more important than authority. Every time we touch authority, we are softened. We have to be softened if we are to serve our God. Otherwise, we will be useless. We must find authority in the church, at work, and everywhere around us. This is the only way to know authority, and this is what qualifies us for God's service. Truly we need a great revelation to see this.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF SERVING GOD</h2><p>In Matthew 7:21-23 the Lord rebuked those who prophesied, cast out demons, and did works of power in His name. Why were they rebuked when they were doing these things in the Lord's name? They were rebuked because they were doing these things out of themselves, not out of obedience to God's will. This is the reason the Lord said that only "he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens" can enter the kingdom of the heavens. The present age is full of lawlessness and rebellion. What is sin? Sin is lawlessness and rebellion according to 1 John 3:4. Being lawless is being without the law, and being without the law is sin. Satan sinned by trespassing against authority. Man breaks the law when the law is present and acts irresponsibly when no law is present. In either case he sins; that is, he does not come under authority. This has nothing to do with good or evil. Evil is, of course, sin, but good is sin as well. Breaking the law is a matter of conduct, and it is sin. Being lawless is a matter of motive, and it is sin as well. In lawlessness one not only rebels against authority but acts as if there is no law. In the end times the presence of the lawless one will result in fallen man overturning all forms of authority. He will act according to his self-will and lawlessness will reign. There will be less and less expression of authority on earth. One day, even parental authority, spousal authority, school authority, governmental authority, and all other forms of authority will disappear. From the time of Satan's fall, throughout man's history of transgression to the end of this age, Satan is continually fighting against God's authority. Man is also standing against God's authority. God establishes authority, but man rebels against it. Rebellion constitutes the underlying principle of this world. In order to serve God, we have to experience authority. We have to free ourselves from these two worldly principles&mdash;lawlessness and rebellion.</p><p>We must realize that there are two principles in this universe. One is the principle of God's authority, and the other is the principle of Satan's rebellion. We cannot serve God on the one hand and take the way of rebellion on the other hand. We cannot serve God in a spirit of rebellion and enmity. A rebellious man can give a message, but Satan will laugh at such a man because he is operating under Satan's principle. Service is directly linked to authority. If we do not settle the matter of authority, we will have problems in all areas of our service and living. We have to ask ourselves if we are under God's authority. As servants of God we have to have a fundamental revelation, a revelation of His authority. We have to face our pathway accurately and squarely. We have to know that any kind of rebellion is from Satan. Those who have not seen authority are destroying their own work. We may say that we are destroying Satan's work, but actually we are working according to Satan's principle. This will lead us nowhere. Unless we touch authority and its underlying root, God will not be able to have any work in China, in other places, and in the entire world. If we do not remove the root of rebellion, we will have no future and no work. May the Lord be merciful to us and grant us a real touch with authority. May we turn away from the principle of rebellion and reject the way of rebellion. May the Lord preserve our service in the principle of submission.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF REBELLION<br />IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 21, 1948<br />Place:Kuling Mountain<br />Scripture Reading:Lev. 10:1-2</h1><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, You are God from eternity to eternity, and it is foolish for man to boast and exalt himself before You. Vain men will bow down at Your feet one day. We acknowledge our human finitude and worthlessness, but if You will stretch forth Your hand, all of our problems will be solved, and You will have a way through us. We cannot do anything. We are unclean, and we dwell among those who are unclean. We are too weak to climb up by ourselves. Unless You move Your hand, everything we do is in vain, and our building is in vain. May You lead us to a fuller knowledge of Yourself. Grant us the light and the revelation to see You. Amen.</p><p>The evening before last we saw that sin is lawlessness. In Greek the word is anomia, which means to be without law. To sin is to be without law. Today I hope you will see the significance of this definition. The word lawlessness is used in the Bible seventeen or eighteen times. It is, for example, used in 1 John 3:4. In studying the Bible it is sometimes convenient to coin a single definition for a word. For example, we can give definitions to each of the words light, life, death, etc. First John 3:4 gives "lawlessness" as the definition of sin. To sin is to trespass against the law. When we tell this to others, they may not agree. They may not agree that sin is lawlessness or a trespass against the law, but Romans 2:12 says, "For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law." Those who sin without the law (anomos) shall also perish without the law (anomos). The word lawlessness in 1 John 3:4 comes from the same word as the expression without the law in Romans 2:12 in the original language. Both are anomia. The prefix a- means to be without, and nomos means the law. Together the word means to be lawless. Most people think that a person sins when he breaks the law and that he has not sinned if he has not broken the law. But this is not according to the Bible. The Bible says that to sin is to be without the law. Romans 2 says that those who sin without the law shall perish without the law. Therefore, the meaning of sin is lawlessness.</p><p>A man sins when he walks according to his self-will and rebels against God's authority. Many brothers and sisters have heard this word from us for many years. We must, however, repeat it again and again. Those who do good according to their own flesh do not please God. Even if a man's conduct is approved, his very person is condemned as long as he acts according to the flesh. Many people do not see the reason for this. Man is condemned for doing good because this good is not performed under God's authority. Sin means to act presumptuously. If a man does not come under authority, he sins even when his conduct is good. In God's eyes all goodness performed by self-will is lawlessness. God is not concerned with the number of sheep and cattle and the amount of fat that man offers to Him. He demands obedience and submission. Obedience and submission are man's responses to authority. Sacrifice, however, can be a response to the Lord, or it can be a response to self-will. Submission is denying the self and setting it aside.</p><p>Submission is absolute, but sacrifice is not. A man may want to offer a sacrifice, but this desire may be a resolution of the self for the satisfaction of the self. We have to see what sin is. Sin is man acting according to his own nature and deliberation. Sin has nothing to do with whether or not this nature and deliberation are evil. In God's eyes a man sins when he acts according to his own nature and deliberation. This principle has underlined all human action throughout the six thousand years of human history. Many people say that they are acting out of good intention, but they do not realize how much lawlessness is behind these acts.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAWLESSNESS OF HAM</h2><p>Today we will mention a few clear cases of lawlessness in the Old Testament. These are all familiar stories to us. First, consider the rebellion of Ham against Noah, which is found in Genesis 9:20-27. This passage gives a record of the first slave in the entire Bible. If we read it, we will find out how slavery came into existence. Noah took the lead to do something wrong. He drank of the wine in the vineyard, became drunk, and was naked in his tent. Noah's younger son, Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness in the tent and went out and told his two brothers, Shem and Japheth. As far as the fact is concerned, Noah had disgraced himself; he should not have become drunk. But there was a spirit of rebellion in Ham. He did not remain under his father's authority. When he saw his father's mistake, he went out and told his brothers immediately. Ham did not see how serious authority is. He did not see that his father was his authority. A man should not be tempted in his words or deeds to trespass against God's deputy authority. He should not give up his fear of God or his respect for deputy authority.</p><h2 class="head2">A Rebellious Man Rejoicing<br />in the Humiliation of Authority</h2><p>A fleshly person always rejoices in the humiliation of deputy authority, and the one with a rebellious spirit will always rebel. The absence of authority means freedom for the flesh. This is the reason so many people enjoy seeing authority fall into disgrace. Ham was Noah's son; he was put under Noah's authority. After Noah became drunk and naked, Ham was tempted to rejoice and make fun of his father's stumbling. He immediately went to his two brothers and told them about their father's action. This shows that he had a spirit of rebellion within him. The first result of the flesh's rebellion against authority is a disrespectful attitude. The next result is transgression in words. Ham was rebellious in his attitude; he enjoyed seeing authority in disgrace. When he saw his father's humiliation, he went out and told his brothers. His brothers, however, were different in attitude; they did not rejoice. They considered it a grievous, sad, shameful, and dishonorable thing. They took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, walked backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. They did not see the nakedness of their father because they walked backward.</p><h2 class="head2">The Result of Rebellion&mdash;Slavery Forever</h2><p>When Noah woke from his sleep, he found out what his younger son had done, and he prophesied. This is the first recorded prophecy of man in the Bible. In Noah's prophecy both Shem and Japheth were blessed. Our Lord Jesus was a descendant of Shem. In other words, Shem ushered in Christ. The blessing which Japheth received related to expansion. For the past two thousand years the spreading of the gospel has been done mainly through Japheth's descendants. Japheth ushered in the preachers of Christ. Ham, however, received the curse. His son Canaan was to be a slave to Shem and Japheth. The result of rebellion to authority is perpetual slavery and perpetual subjection to authority. The beginning of slavery in the Bible is with Canaan. Being a slave means being under others' authority and losing one's freedom perpetually.</p><p>We have to see that the first man, Adam, fell through disobedience to God's word and by acting according to his own will. He ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was cursed. After the flood Noah became drunk and exposed his nakedness. However, this incident exposed Ham's rebellion, and he came under a curse which lasts even until today. The first person to be cursed after the flood was Ham. I have a heavy burden within me to say a word to everyone here: If we aspire to serve the Lord, we all must allow the Lord to bring us to a point where we experience authority in a drastic way. We have to allow God's authority to cut through our whole being, even our very constitution. We have to meet authority in a drastic way. If a person only sees Noah as a man and nothing else, he has not touched authority. But if a person touches the authority behind Noah, he will not be rash and careless. We have to touch authority before our service to God will be acceptable to Him. We cannot serve God under the principle of lawlessness or in the spirit of lawlessness.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OFFERING OF STRANGE FIRE<br />BY AARON'S SONS, NADAB AND ABIHU</h2><p>The evening before last we read Leviticus 8 concerning the sanctification of the house of Aaron for the holy priesthood. Chapter nine goes on to speak of Aaron and his house offering sacrifices and the commencement of their priestly service. In chapter ten we find Nadab and Abihu with strange fire. We should first go back to chapters eight and nine. Please note 8:2a, 6, 12-14a, 18, 22b-24, 27, 30-31, 36; 9:1, 8-9, 12, 18.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reason for Being Consumed<br />on Account of the Strange Fire</h2><p>Everyone who is learning to take the way of God's service has to see the seriousness of the story of Nadab and Abihu! They offered strange fire, which was not according to God's command. I am afraid you do not see the seriousness of this offense. God chose Aaron to be the high priest; He did not choose his sons to be the high priests. Aaron's sons became priests by virtue of being in their father's house. Aaron was the high priest. God chose Nadab and Abihu because Aaron's house was right in the sight of the Lord, not because they were right in God's sight personally. God chose the sons of Levi because of their ancestor; the choosing was unrelated to the sons themselves. Aaron's sons became priests after their father's footsteps. The Bible is careful to point out that in their priestly service, it was Aaron with his sons who handled the sacrifices on the altar. God appointed Aaron to be the authority, and his sons were to be under his authority. Leviticus 9:8-9, 12 tells us that Aaron was the one who offered sacrifices; his sons were only his helpers and learners. God had no intention that Nadab and Abihu would do anything by themselves. They saw what Aaron did, and they thought they could do the same. They began to do what God had not commanded them to do. They offered strange fire, which was not according to God's command. Before Aaron moved, they should not have moved. Aaron did not order them to offer the sacrifice; they did it of their own accord. This was strange fire. Nadab and Abihu should have followed Aaron alone. However, they thought that they could offer sacrifices as well, and they did so without Aaron's command. They were not acting under authority when they offered their sacrifices. First Samuel 15:22 says that "to obey is better than sacrifice." In this instance there was sacrifice but no obedience and no submission to authority. It was actually rebellion against God's authority. This is the reason fire came from God and consumed them.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Work Being a Coordination with Authority</h2><p>Our service to God is realized through our coordination with authority. This can be seen in the service of Aaron and his sons. Some people have to find the proper authority above them. Their place is to remain under others as helpers. Others have to stand above men and serve as authorities to many. Our work must be carried out in a good order and in coordination with authority. Unless we work this way, our endeavor will not be pleasing to God. We have read the story of Nadab and Abihu for many years. We have to clearly see that for Nadab and Abihu to act independently of Aaron was the same as for them to act independently of God. In Leviticus 8 and 9 Aaron and his sons were referred to repeatedly in the matter of the offering of sacrifices. God's work is carried out in the principle of coordination. No one can be responsible for a work alone. Rather, three, five, eight, or ten people have to work together like a family. Some should stand in the place of Aaron, while others should stand in the place of his sons. God sanctified both Aaron and his sons. In Leviticus 9 we see Aaron offering sacrifices as a priest and his sons helping him. But after Nadab and Abihu saw how Aaron offered sacrifices, they thought they could offer sacrifices in a similar manner. The result was judgment. Any service that has not been touched by authority is an offering of strange fire. Anyone who says, "Since So-and-so can do it, I can do it as well," is in rebellion. The same thing can be said of those who should follow others but do not.</p><p>Some have challenged Leviticus 8 and 9, saying, "If Aaron's sons were simply following Aaron, why did they need to be under authority?" Aaron's sons might have said, "What is so special about the sacrifices? We can offer the same." But remember, if we behave like Aaron's sons when they followed behind their father, we will bring blessing to others, and our service to God will be acceptable to Him; but if we take the initiative and shake off Aaron's authority, we will be offering strange fire, and the result will be death. I have often felt that an atmosphere of independent evangelism has developed in China since 1926 and 1927. Independent evangelism, however, means independence from coordination and authority. Such practice has inflicted great loss on the church in China. Much blessing has been lost because of a lack of vision in coordination. We have to see that in our service we must join ourselves to the authority that God has established. We have to see the seriousness of this matter. In our service to God, there is the need of coordination with authority.</p><h2 class="head1">AARON AND MIRIAM REVILING MOSES</h2><p>In Numbers 12 Aaron and Miriam reviled God's deputy authority. Aaron was the eldest brother, and Miriam was the eldest sister. Even though Moses was Aaron and Miriam's younger brother, God appointed him as the deputy authority. It was wrong for Moses, as a descendant of Shem, to marry a Cushite, that is, a descendant of Ham. Both Miriam and Aaron were older than Moses, and they reviled him for marrying the Cushite woman. They were brother and sister within the same family, and for them it did not seem out of place to rebuke Moses concerning their unhappiness over their sister-in-law. But their dissatisfaction ultimately involved more than a family dispute; it touched God's work. In verse 2 Aaron and Miriam said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" Once they said this, the situation changed. They moved the controversy from the realm of a family dispute to the realm of God's work. Within the realm of their own family, it might have been all right for Aaron and Miriam to utter their dissatisfaction with Moses' marriage, but once the matter was moved into the realm of God's work, they overstepped. God entrusted the authority of the work to Moses, not to Aaron or Miriam. It might have been all right if they had limited their complaint to within the family or before God alone. But as soon as they touched God's work, they fell into great error. God had not chosen them to be the authority. Instead, God had chosen Moses to be the authority. God alone was qualified to rebuke His servant. No one else was qualified to rebuke him. In His work only God had the position to rebuke Moses. Neither Moses' brother nor his sister could do this. Many people mix family affairs with God's work. This is a great mistake. The Jews made the same mistake. This is the reason they did not believe in Christ. They rejected Him because they thought they knew His brothers and sisters. They thought they knew His family.</p><h2 class="head2">Offending Deputy Authority Being the Same as<br />Offending God's Authority</h2><p>Aaron and Miriam challenged Moses, saying, "Has he [Jehovah] not spoken through us also?" Then the Bible says, "And Jehovah heard it" (Num. 12:2). This may be considered as a parenthetical word. It is not the main body of the text. It seems as if Moses did not hear Aaron and Miriam's word; he did not say anything, but Jehovah heard it. Concerning Moses' reaction, the Bible only says, "Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all men who were on the face of the earth" (v. 3). Suddenly Jehovah spoke to all three of them. He asked them to come to the tabernacle, and He spoke to Aaron and Miriam: "Hear My words: If there is a prophet among you, I Jehovah make Myself known to him in a vision; in a dream I speak with him. Not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house. With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in obscure words; and he beholds the form of Jehovah" (vv. 6-8). God said that had Aaron and Miriam been prophets, He would have spoken to them in a vision or in a dream. But He was different with respect to Moses; He spoke with him mouth to mouth. Here we should consider what deputy authority is. Deputy authority is God's authority; it is authority given to man by God, and it is something initiated by God. No one can touch Moses lightly. As soon as he touches Moses, he touches God in Moses. It seems as if God was saying, "Miriam, even if you are a prophetess, at the most I would have spoken to you in a vision or in a dream. But with Moses I speak mouth to mouth." Then the Lord said, "Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?" (v. 8). God's anger was kindled against them. It is not a small thing to speak against God's deputy authority. It invites God's wrath.</p><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that all authorities are of God and issue from God. No one on earth can take any authority away. No self-assumed authority is real authority, and no one can take away any authority. All authorities come from God. We must see that every authority is from God. Moses' brother and sister did not trespass against Moses; they trespassed against the authority he represented. This is the reason that God's anger was kindled. Once a man touches deputy authority, he touches God, because all authority is from God. Aaron could discipline Moses for his marriage because Moses was the younger brother in their family. God respected Aaron's place. Aaron, however, needed to see that his brother was God's servant in God's work. It was God who gave his brother the authority. If a man offended Moses, he did not offend Moses himself but God who had chosen Moses. It is a frightful thing to touch God's authority. I would like to repeat one word over and over again: Touching God's deputy authority is the same as touching God's authority. We should not presume that we can afford to offend deputy authority. No one should offend God's authority, and no one should offend God's deputy authority. Offending God's deputy authority is the same as offending God's own authority. An offense against God's deputy authority is the same as an offense against God's own authority. Many people say that they will only listen to God, not to any deputy authority. Please remember, however, that if we do not listen to God's deputy authority, we are not listening to God's authority. If we offend God's deputy authority, we are offending God. Deputy authority is God's authority. We do not need to know anything about the person who is acting as the deputy authority. All we have to ask is whether or not he is a deputy authority. A man cannot say that he bows to God yet refuses to obey His deputy authority. If a man is afraid of offending God's authority, he equally should be afraid of offending God's deputy authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Offense against Deputy Authority<br />Being a Serious Thing</h2><p>After God's anger burned against Miriam and Aaron, the cloud was lifted from over the tent of meeting. This signifies the departure of God's presence. Normally, the lifting of the pillar of cloud in the day signaled the children of Israel to set forth on their journey. On this day, however, the lifting of the cloud from the tent of meeting was not a signal to begin the journey. Whenever there is reviling, God's presence is withheld, and the movement of His people stops. This is not a small thing. In man's eyes an argument with Moses only involved Moses; the issue seemed minor. In God's eyes, however, this was very critical. God withdrew His presence because of this argument. This shows the seriousness of the offense. Moreover, Miriam became leprous. She was the one who instigated the whole incident, and the instigator always comes first in everything. Being a leper was no better than being a Cushite. A Cushite, at the most, was dark in skin, but a leper was unclean and had to be kept away for seven days from the camp of God's people.</p><p>This matter was resolved by Moses' intercession for his sister's healing. God told Moses, "If her father had done no more than spit in her face, should she not be disgraced for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp for seven days, and after that she may be brought in again" (12:14). Spitting was a sign of shame to the Jews. Here we are told that if her father had spit in her face, she would have been shut out of the camp for seven days. This meant that she had to bear her shame for seven days. After the seven days, the cloud was lifted, and the Israelites were allowed to move on. God removed one shame with another kind of shame. The sin of reviling was absolved. According to the Bible, transgression against authority is a very serious thing. If we are wrong in our attitude towards God's servant, we stumble, and there is no way for us to go on. We must be very careful and exercised in dealing with God's servants. We cannot speak lightly against them. Today many people revile and deal capriciously with God's servants and those who are ahead of them without realizing the seriousness of the matter. May God open our eyes to see the seriousness of authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REBELLION OF KORAH'S COMPANY</h2><p>The above examples first show sons rebelling against their father, then sons acting arbitrarily, and finally a brother and sister speaking against their own brother. All these things happen because of men's blindness; they do not see the spiritual relationship that exists in their midst. They do not realize that they are not dealing merely with family relationships. A few years after the incident with Miriam, another rebellion broke out. In Numbers 16 we find Moses and Aaron being attacked by Korah's company and by Dathan and Abiram. This time men outside Moses and Aaron's immediate family rose up against them. Korah's company of men were Levites; they were assigned to carry the ark, and they had nothing to do with the sacrifices. Dathan and Abiram were descendants of Reuben. Here we find the tribe of Levi and the tribe of Reuben. According to the flesh, Reuben was Jacob's oldest son. The tribe of Levi was chosen to take the lead in spiritual matters. The tribe of Reuben, however, was the leading tribe in physical matters. These two tribes were not happy that God spoke only through Moses and Aaron. They rose up, reviled, and attacked them. In addition to these men, there were two hundred fifty leaders among the people. These men were chosen by Moses to share the responsibility of ruling over the people of Israel. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, together with the two hundred fifty leaders rose up and spoke against Moses, saying, "You have gone too far! For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?" (v. 3). They all reviled and attacked Moses and Aaron fiercely and vehemently.</p><h2 class="head2">A Deputy Authority Being a Meek Person</h2><p>When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. He was a very meek person, more than all men who were on the face of the earth. Unless a man is meek, he will not fall on his face when others revile him. Those who fear God will fall on their face because they know that authority belongs to God. A deputy authority does not walk around in pomp and style. He does not sit in a high chair and demand obedience from others. Moses was not reviled while sitting on a high pedestal; he was a person who could fall on his face. He was indeed a meek person. This is the reason he had the authority. Unless a man first falls on his face, he cannot truly be lifted up.</p><h2 class="head2">The Serious Consequence of Rebellion</h2><p>Following this, Moses said, "In the morning Jehovah will make known who is His, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him; even him whom He will choose He will cause to come near to Him" (v. 5). He sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said, "We will not come up. Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also make yourself a ruler over us? Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up" (vv. 12-14). Then Moses was angry. He prayed to God, and this precipitated God's judgment. God wanted to consume the entire congregation, but through Moses' intercession, He agreed to destroy only those who rebelled. Moses told the rebellious ones, "In this shall you know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own mind. If these men die the death that all men die, or if they are visited by what is appointed to all men, then Jehovah has not sent me. But if Jehovah creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up, and all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised Jehovah" (vv. 28-30). After he spoke, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with all their goods (vv. 31-32).</p><h2 class="head2">Rebellious Ones Living<br />in the Realm of Reasonings</h2><p>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram had reasons for seeing things their way. They reasoned that the whole congregation was holy. Therefore, they said that Moses should not have assumed authority in himself because God was also with the congregation. Moses and Aaron readily acknowledged that God was with the congregation. The rebellious ones went on to say that Moses and Aaron had exalted themselves above the congregation of Jehovah. They had their own reasons for saying this. Then Dathan and Abiram accused Moses for leading them up out of the land flowing with milk and honey and of not leading them into Canaan but into the wilderness. In comparison with the wilderness, they regarded Egypt as a land flowing with milk and honey. Since the wilderness was not a land flowing with milk and honey, they accused Moses of thinking that they were blind. They were very clear that they were in the wilderness. Their eyes were clear and they saw the situation. They boasted that Moses could never make them turn a blind eye to the situation. They had their reasons, and they could argue a great deal. Please remember, however, that those who only touch reason are slaves to reason, while those who touch authority are servants of God. If a man lives by teaching, he will walk by reasonings. If we are to serve our God, we cannot tolerate the evil of these two companies of men. If we want to take God's way, we have to learn to walk not by sight or by reason. In Dathan and Abiram's own words, sometimes we have to "put out" our own eyes and walk by faith alone. A man often does not have spiritual eyesight unless his fleshly eyes first become blind. If a man has spiritual eyesight and is under God's authority, he will see that Canaan is a fact and the wilderness an empty mirage. All those who submit to authority with blind eyes will enter Canaan.</p><p>We have to ask ourselves, "By what principle do we serve God?" If we are in the principle of Korah's company and Reuben's tribe, we will concur with their arguments and live in the realm of reasons. Moses and Aaron, however, were the ones appointed by God to oversee the conquest of Canaan. Those who obeyed them would enter Canaan. Those who rebelled would die in the wilderness. This is a very solemn principle. The principle of the church is diametrically opposed to the principle of Hades. The principle of the church is obedience, while the principle of Hades is rebellion. If a man rebels, his way is the way of Hades and death. When Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled, the earth opened and they went down to Hades. Such a way is a dark way, and leading them to Caanan is the last thing that such a way could accomplish. Obedience, however, is the way of light; it is a way that leads to Canaan. Brothers and sisters, please remember this word: Those who close their eyes will enter Canaan, while those who open their eyes may not enter it.</p><h2 class="head2">The Fundamental Way to Serve God</h2><p>In all spiritual matters and particularly in our service to God, the most fundamental thing is to touch authority. Those who have only touched their fathers, sons, and brothers, but who have not touched authority, do not have a way to go on. Ham saw his father's mistake, but he did not see that his father was his authority. Aaron's two sons, seeing what their father had done, did the same, but they did not see that their father was the authority. Aaron and Miriam only saw their brother's mistake; they did not touch the matter of deputy authority. Many people only touch their fathers, husbands, and brothers; they have not touched God's authority. Miriam may have been a talkative person and may have thought that it was a small thing for an older sister to rebuke a mild younger brother. She might have done it a hundred times before and might have thought it a trivial thing to rebuke him again. But previously, she touched Moses as her brother. She did not fully realize that God had appointed Moses to be the authority. Once she touched him again, she was touching God's authority. When God's authority is involved, one should forget about any brother-sister relationship or father-son relationship. A person may think that touching his father or brother involves nothing more than touching his earthly kinsman. But to God, he is touching His authority. Korah's company might have thought that they were touching men of their own tribe. They were responsible for carrying the ark, while Moses and Aaron were responsible for offering sacrifices; both were serving God. The other two hundred fifty men also might have thought that they were serving God as well. But they only saw the superficial aspect of things. They thought that since they were serving God as much as Moses was, they were more or less the same as Moses. They did not realize that they were touching God's authority when they touched Moses and Aaron. They only touched men; they did not touch God's authority.</p><p>The most fundamental and crucial point is to touch God's authority before touching men. This is the only way for us to go on in God's service. If a man touches only men but not God, he cannot go on in the way of God's service. We are not merely training you to take the church or the work on. In the coming days, you have to touch authority wherever you go. You have to touch authority in the family, in society, and in the church. It is wrong if a person only touches authority in the church but not in the world. Such a person is of little use in the hand of the Lord. If you touch authority wherever you go, you will be a right person. A sister may submit to authority at home because of pressure from her husband or mother-in-law, but she may throw off all authority once she is away from home. This is wrong. We must touch authority head-on, like knocking our head against a wall and bleeding. Here at Kuling Mountain, we have to touch authority, and our head must bleed from the wound. If we touch authority this way, we will have a proper fear when we go to Shanghai or Tsingtao. We will be afraid of authority inasmuch as a man is afraid of the wall after knocking his head against it. We must have this healthy fear wherever we go; we can no longer be careless. If we do this, it means that we have touched authority in a genuine way. If someone thinks that the wall here at Kuling Mountain is too hard and tries to dodge it, he is making a big mistake. If he really touches God's authority, he will walk softly wherever he goes and talk softly to whomever he meets. This is the fundamental issue. Unless he touches authority this way, he has no way to go on in his service.</p><p>Everything depends on our very person. It depends on how we deal with authority. It has nothing to do with Noah, Moses, or Aaron. It relates to whether or not we have touched God's authority and how we deal with it. God's deputy authority is God's authority. We should note that it is rare for a person to receive direct commands from God today. It is rare for a man to touch God's authority directly. Most of the time, men touch deputy authority. The command from a deputy authority deserves as much attention as a direct command from God. We have to see that deputy authority is God's very own authority. Hopefully, the church will release the proper revelation concerning this matter one day. Then all the brothers and sisters will touch authority and learn submission in everything. That will be a brand new church. There was no king among the Israelites during the time of the judges, and everyone did what was right in his own eyes. Everything was in a state of confusion. The same can be said of the church today. When the matter of authority is not clear among the brothers and sisters and when the proper coordination is not built up, there is confusion everywhere, and everyone walks according to what is right in his own eyes. May God be merciful to us and grant us light to see the seriousness of the matter of authority. May we touch His authority in a genuine way.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Lord, shine a great light on us. Today may we see what we have not seen all these years. May we find authority everywhere and all the time, and may we submit to authority everywhere and all the time. We pray that You would remove all of our rebellion.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE SYSTEM OF AUTHORITY<br />GOD HAS ORDAINED</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 22, 1948<br />Place:Kuling Mountain<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 13:1</h1><p>We have spent the past few days on the subject of God's authority. We did not follow any order in our discussion. Yesterday we spoke of a few examples in the Old Testament related to rebellion against authority. Today I would like to point out one basic principle of authority. This principle is stated as follows: No authority has its origin apart from God. All authorities are from God and are appointed by God. God has ordained His system of authority in the universe, and more particularly, in this world, for the purpose that this system would manifest His authority. We must realize that every authority within this system is ordained by God and is of God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD ORDAINING A SYSTEM<br />OF AUTHORITY IN THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>Although we have said this before, we will repeat it today. God controls and rules over the entire universe (including the physical world) with authority. He runs the universe according to the principle of authority. If we trace authority in this universe to its highest source, we will find God Himself. As we ascend level after level on the ladder of authority, we reach the peak which is God's own authority. Yesterday I said that it is rare for a man to receive direct commandments from God. It is rare to find God's authority directly acting on a person. Most of the time His authority is expressed through those who are charged and commissioned by Him to be deputy authorities. God has ordained certain men, systems, or organizations as His authority. Such deputy authorities are commissioned and ordained by God. Yesterday we also said that a command from a deputy authority deserves as much attention as a direct command from God. All authorities are from God. Therefore, direct authority and deputy (i.e., indirect) authority are equally important. Only the foolish vinedressers demanded the personal appearance of the master. They did not consider the coming of the prophets to be sufficient. Even the son of the master was not good enough for them. This is the reason they killed the prophets one by one. In the end, when the son did come, they did not obey him, but killed him as well. Finally, the master himself had to come to deal with the situation (Matt. 21:33-41). This is the story of the foolish vinedressers. Only a foolish person would say that deputy authority cannot be considered as authority.</p><p>God created the universe with His word. He spoke, and it was done. God did not have to resort to any special means; He did not have to depend on any special kind of power. When He said, "Let there be light," there was light. Once He says something, it is done. This is the basic principle of God's creation of the universe. After creating all things, God instituted many natural laws to rule over the universe. Every object is ruled by some kind of natural law. On the one hand, God established these natural laws. On the other hand, He upholds all things by the word of His power (Heb. 1:3). Therefore, we can say that God rules the entire universe by His authority. The entire universe is upheld by the operation of natural laws; there is no exception. These natural laws continuously operate. This principle applies not only to the natural realm but also to the supernatural realm (i.e., the spiritual realm). God rules over everything in the spiritual realm with His authority. God created the cherubim, the angels, and the twenty-four elders. There are also the gods spoken of in Psalm 82. They are the deputy authorities appointed by God in the universe. Every authority has his own rank in God's ordering. Unfortunately, one of the cherubim fell. Lucifer fell because of his ambition to set up his own throne to make himself equal with God. He wanted to overthrow God's authority and to build up his own authority, but he fell. One-third of the angels followed him as a result of his fall. They became the powers of darkness today. The head of this dark force is the fallen one, Satan.</p><p>In His re-creation, God created man on the sixth day and placed him under His authority. Man is different from other creatures. God entrusted man with authority and assigned him to rule over the earth and to dress and keep it. He put the fowls of the air, the fish of the sea, and the beasts and creeping things of the earth under man's dominion. All living creatures on earth are under man's authority. God commanded man not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because he would die in the day that he ate of it. Whoever ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would die; this was a fact. This command also signifies authority. It was not a threat of God. (God wanted man to receive the knowledge of good and evil directly from Him. But when man fell, good and evil became something within him.) God forbade man to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This was a command, and it related to authority. Eve was tempted to eat of the fruit. In her rebellion she took the fruit and ate it. As a result, she committed the sin of rebellion. Paul said in 1 Timothy that Adam came first in God's creation, and Eve followed. For this reason the woman should submit, but Eve did not submit. She was tempted, and she fell (Gen. 3:12-13). Paul saw authority in the order of creation. In reading Genesis we find that Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when she ignored God's command. She did not ask her husband first. Instead, she stretched out her hand and took the fruit. In reality, when Eve stretched out her hand, she was stretching out her head. Eve's action signified her rebellion against God's established institution on this earth; she did not submit to Adam. If a man stretches out his hand without first checking with authority, in reality he is stretching out his own head. Satan tempted Eve to rebel against Adam. Today he is leading the whole world into rebellion.</p><p>To rebel against God's established institution is to rebel against God's authority. In earthly institutions those who come afterwards should submit to those who have come before. This is God's ordained order. Eve destroyed the order of authority. She ate of the fruit which God forbade. This shows that the relationship between God and man was broken. Man overturned God's authority, and the relationship between God and man was destroyed. Man took the same line as Satan when he overthrew God's authority. Satan fell because he wanted to make himself equal with God. When Satan tempted Eve to eat of the fruit, he told her that she would be like God if she ate of it. This was a temptation to uplift oneself to God's stature. It is according to Satan's principle of overturning God's authority. Satan wanted to usurp God's position. But he got into trouble with God's authority instead. Eve's sin brought her into conflict with human authority on the one hand and with God's authority on the other. She ate of the fruit, and Adam ate of it as well. Satan succeeded, and the line of authority between God and man was broken. Man did not check with God or inquire of Him. He contemplated, planned, and acted in himself. He failed to learn to inquire of Him or to act under His authority. Such an act annulled authority.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY IN GOVERNMENT</h2><p>Although Satan fell, God did not give up the entire universe, because there were still many good and clean angels, and the universe was still under God's care. Likewise, after Adam and Eve rebelled against God's authority and the world and mankind fell, God did not give up the world. He still appoints authority in this world and still calls men to maintain and uphold authority. We can find authority in the government and in the family. All the institutions of authority that God has ordained in this world are involved mainly with human relationships, such as the relationships between men and women, between husband and wife, between parents and children, and between servants and masters. Other than these four domestic relationships, there are official relationships of those holding offices outside the family. God has set up systems of authorities in all forms of human relationships.</p><p>God has put those whom He has chosen into authority in this world. From the day of creation and for the next 1,656 years, God seemingly did not appoint any authority on this earth. During that time some men rose up by themselves and tried to assume authority on their own. After 1,656 years, that is, after the flood, God instituted government among men. He decreed and said to Noah, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" (Gen. 9:6). Capital punishment was God's first decree. After the flood God transferred the power of human rule to man himself. Therefore, all officers and governments are appointed by God. Deputy authority in the civil world started in Noah's time and has been with us until today. Today officers are found in all forms of government. Although many officers and administrators are evil, authority still exists with them. These men may not be godly; they may not believe in God, but they are the deputy authorities and are appointed by God. Although all the kingdoms of the earth are under Satan's dominion, authority still rests in God's hand. Entire nations may be under Satan's influence. In fact, the entire world will be under Satan one day. Yet the principle of authority is still under God's hand.</p><p>Recently I read in the newspaper that England is almost as advanced as Germany and the Soviet Union in its movement towards socialism. It is not a matter of the degree of advancement; in all these countries the advancement is in full swing already. England is still democratic in name, but it is already run by principles which find great kinship to Marx and Engel's communism. The Lord Jesus testified solemnly to Pilate, saying, "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36). God's kingdom is heavenly and spiritual; it is not of this world. Therefore, none of the nations that exist today are God's kingdom. However, they still derive their authority from God. No matter what system of government a nation takes, its authority comes from God. The founding of every nation is based on God's authority. God chose the people of Israel and established them as a nation. The nation of Israel became God's kingdom. David was its king, and he was appointed by God. God first appointed Saul and then later David. Saul was an evil king, while David was a good king. Yet both the evil king and the good king derived their authority from God. The history of the Old Testament shows us clearly that due to Israel's continuous rebellion against God's authority, the king of Babylon came and took all the Israelites away as captives. After Babylon there was Persia. In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, God stirred up his heart, and he made a decree throughout his land. The Bible gives an account of this: "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah, the God of heaven, given to me" (2 Chron. 36:23). He said this because God had stirred up his heart. God even called Cyrus "My shepherd" (Isa. 44:28) and His anointed (45:1). The king of Persia was appointed by God. Although Cyrus did not know God at all, his authority was from God.</p><p>In the New Testament we find Jews suffering under the hands of the Roman Empire, having lost control of their country. The Israelites were in a situation like ours when we were under the hand of the Japanese. The Jews were ridiculed as men without a country. The Lord was born shortly after the conquest of the Jewish nation. At that time the rulers, like Pontius Pilate, were Gentiles, yet they were still God's appointed authorities. Once the Pharisees tempted the Lord by asking Him, "Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?" The Lord answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" (Matt. 22:17, 21). This means that the Lord acknowledged Caesar's authority. He acknowledged the existence of earthly authorities. If the Lord did not know God, He could very well have become a revolutionary leader. But He never gave Himself to any revolutionary movement. He recognized the authority of human government as coming from God.</p><p>The Roman Empire continued from one generation to the next. After Claudius died, Nero came to the throne, and the institution of slavery became much more prevalent. When Paul wrote his Epistles, he told the slaves to obey those over them. He continued the subject of authority. Paul told men during Nero's time to submit to authority. Others could have accused Paul of being a traitor. Such an accusation might not have been a sweet thing to take, but Paul insisted on submission just the same. In the Old Testament there was Jeremiah. In the New Testament there was Paul. These two men had a most difficult job. God charged Jeremiah to tell the Israelites to surrender to the Chaldeans (Jer. 21:9). He told the king of Judah to bring his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and to serve him and his people so that the Jews would live (27:12). In the New Testament Paul had similar words to say. Both of them saw God's authority. This is the reason they charged men to submit to those in authority and to pay tax where tax was due. In Romans 13:1-3 Paul said, positively, that every person should be subject to those over him, and negatively, that whoever resisted authority opposed God's ordination. He said that the authorities which exist are ordained by God. Verse 5 says that it is necessary to be subject, and verse 7 says that we should render tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due. Paul pointed out that God has established authority in government.</p><p>Some may not be able to swallow these words. Paul said that rulers are only a terror to evil workers. Some may argue that many rulers are evil and that men are punished even when they perform much good. But the truth is that there is still the pretense of justice even with evil and corrupt rulers. They cannot cast aside their confession and blatantly claim that they are punishing men or executing them for doing good. Even when a ruler rewards evil for good, he has to first accuse the good man and make him evil before he can punish him. In the same way, when he befriends the mob and enlists them in his army, he first has to extol them for their patriotism. He has to ascribe good names to them first and then prove to others that he is rewarding the good and punishing the evil. He may be wrong in his conduct, but at least he has to be right in his principle. God says that all authorities are from Him. He has established the authorities. Although there are evil rulers and evil laws, these men and institutions still stand for God's authority. The day this world order stops will be the day when all worldly rulers are destroyed and the lawless one appears. It is a good thing that rulers are with us today. A government based on anarchy is one that hastens the coming of Satan's kingdom. Of course, when Satan comes, the kingdom of God will also have drawn near. Satan is the most lawless one. When this lawless one appears, he will annul God's principle of authority. Then there will be no divine authority; evil men will be uplifted, and good men will be destroyed. Then men will call evil those who do good and call good those who commit evil. God's entire principle of authority will be overthrown. This will be the end, and lawlessness will take over completely.</p><p>Today we Christians should pay attention to four things with respect to government. First, we should render tax to whom tax is due. Second, we should render custom to whom custom is due. Third, we should render fear to whom fear is due. It is right for us to fear soldiers and policemen. We are those who are under authority. We cannot say that we have nothing to do with policemen since we are good citizens and have not broken any law. Although the policemen may not come after us, we still have to fear them in our heart. Although the nations are now part of Satan's kingdom, God's authority is still with them. Therefore, we must still render fear to whom fear is due. Fourth, we should render honor to whom honor is due. We have to respect the rulers. Titus 3:1 says that we should be "subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work." This is the proper attitude towards human government.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY IN THE FAMILY</h2><p>God has also ordained authority in the family. God has established proper relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and masters and servants. I would like to draw our attention to the two books in the Bible that rank the highest in spirituality&mdash;Ephesians and Colossians. Both books have two sections. The first section declares spiritual facts, while the second section discusses practical issues of this life. The first section is positive while the second section is negative. In both Epistles of such high standing, there is reference to authority in the family. Both books speak of the relationships between husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and masters and servants. Ephesians 5 and 6 charge us to know authority in the family. According to the divine ordination for the family, the husband should be the authority, and the wife should submit to him. The wife cannot be the authority. Between father and son, the father is the authority. A son may be more educated than the father, but authority still rests with the parents. God has not made children the authority. In the same way, between master and servant, the master is the authority. A servant has to obey his master in all things. Ephesians 6 and Colossians 3 both speak of servants serving their masters as if serving God. The Bible clearly tells us to obey all forms of authority and to be right in our attitude towards them. Wherever we find husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants, we find the presence of God's authority.</p><p>God's authority in the universe is being carried out through human government. The same authority is also carried out through family relationships. God's principle of authority has not changed since the creation of the world. Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, Ephesians and Colossians rank the highest in spirituality, but neither of them neglect the importance of upholding God's authority. These two books do not put authority aside. In reading them I marvel at Paul, who, though erudite in the lofty things of the Spirit, was not negligent of the relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and masters and servants. This shows us that from the creation of the world until now, God has not given up on the matter of authority. Paul shows us in Colossians 3 and 4 that God wants believers to uphold His authority in the church and in the family. He speaks similarly in 1 Timothy 6 and Titus 2 and 3. His words to Timothy and Titus are similar. When he wrote to these spiritual sons, he charged them in the same way. It seems as if he was saying, "This is my teaching, and you have to teach the same thing." Paul charged Timothy and Titus to speak the same thing and not to change his teaching. These four books are very special. While Ephesians and Colossians are on high truths, 1 Timothy and Titus are on the work. On the one hand, Paul spoke on the subject of authority in the highest books on spirituality. On the other hand, he spoke on the same subject in his Epistles related to the work. Towards the end of the apostolic age, we find the same admonition. In his first Epistle Peter said, "Household servants, be subject in all fear to your masters, not only to the good and forbearing but also to the crooked" (2:18). Again he said, "In like manner, wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without the word through the manner of life of their wives" (3:1). Ninety percent of husbands who do not accept the Lord reject Him because of disobedience in their wives. The above verses clearly show us that God intends that we uphold authority in all human relationships.</p><p>Some may have a problem here. When Paul and Peter wrote their Epistles, the Roman Empire was at the height of its power, and slavery was extremely prevalent. Male and female slaves were sold in open markets. It was a cruel business. Some may ask, "Should we allow such an inhumane institution to remain?" Of course, the church does not support slavery, but Paul exhorted slaves to obey their masters on the one hand, and he charged masters to deal well with their slaves on the other hand. Onesimus was a runaway slave, but Paul told Philemon to treat him well. He had no intention of overturning the institution of slavery. It was not a matter of the merit or evil of the system but a matter of God's authority. Whether or not the institution of slavery is justified is a different issue altogether. God's ordination is for slaves to submit to authority. It is better for us to live with a wrong system and uphold God's authority than to destroy a system and thus destroy God's authority in the process. On the one hand, we realize the injustice that existed in the society of the time. On the other hand, we realize that with an institution as wrong and inhumane as slavery, God did not give up His authority.</p><h2 class="head1">IN OTHER RELATIONSHIPS</h2><p>In addition to the family, we have male-female relationships. The Bible shows that both men and women have a proper place. God ordains that there be order and authority between male and female. Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 11 that God is the head of Christ, and the man is the head of the woman (v. 3). Between the sexes God has established authority. Paul said that every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head (v. 5). He also said that women are not permitted to speak in the churches (14:34). In 1 Timothy 2 he forbade women from teaching (v. 12). Yet today many women are teaching. It seems that the tendency for women to preach has been present from the beginning. God charges women to come under authority. Between men and women, the former stand for authority, while the latter stand for obedience.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM</h2><p>We have seen God's authority manifested in various institutions&mdash;first, in human government, second, in the family, and third, in ordinary relationships. There is a fourth place where His authority is ordained&mdash;in the supernatural world, the universe. It seems as if we are conducting a Bible study this morning. The above four considerations show us clearly what authority is. The best example of submission to authority in the Bible can be found in the account of Michael's dispute with the devil over Moses' body as recorded in Jude 9. Michael was one of the cherubim. He was an angel who was given dominion over everything. God made him one of the archangels; yet at one time, he was Satan's subordinate. It was Michael's specific responsibility to contend for God's interest, but he was once a subject of Satan. He disputed with Satan over Moses' body. When Moses died, God probably entrusted his body to Michael for burial. According to the principle of 2 Corinthians 5, Moses must have resurrected on the Mount of Transfiguration. Michael probably was moving Moses' body to that mountain when Satan stopped him and argued with him. Michael was in a difficult position. He had God's order to bring Moses' body to the Mount of Transfiguration, yet Satan, who was once over him, would not let him do it. In reading Jude 9, we find that Michael "did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you." Michael could not rebuke Satan himself. He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you," because the Lord's authority was higher than that of Satan. This is a pattern of how we should submit to authority.</p><p>Michael did not dare to rebuke Satan because Satan was above him in God's original ordination, not because he was afraid or powerless. Here is a lesson for Christians to learn; we should learn from Michael's submission. He only said, "The Lord rebuke you." He invoked a higher authority to rebuke Satan. He dared not rebuke Satan directly because he did not want to upset the order in the divine authority. If our eyes are blind to the way God upholds His authority, nothing more can be said. But if our eyes are opened to this matter, we will realize that God will sacrifice anything but His authority. Unlike Michael, we are the new creation, and we do not have to be under Satan. God has never entrusted man to Satan, but we still should learn the principle of submission from Michael. Michael would not rebuke Satan. He only said, "The Lord rebuke you." Those who have this kind of attitude know God's authority. The book of Jude teaches us to submit to God's authority in this kind of way.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING AUTHORITY IN THE SYSTEMS<br />ESTABLISHED BY GOD</h2><p>Every one of us has to touch authority. Otherwise, we run into problems. If a man touches authority, all of his problems will go away. When we realize that all systems of authority are established by God, we have nothing more to say. Some people do not want to submit to their masters, their parents, or their brothers and sisters. Some wives do not want to submit to their husbands. Some people excuse their disobedience by saying that their masters are too poor or that their husbands or brothers are not worthy of their submission. Some children, who have graduated from universities, think that their parents are too old-fashioned. They think they know more than their parents. This becomes an excuse for not obeying their parents. Many people have problems with other men. If we look around, we will find that many people are asking these questions. Everyone who has not touched authority has these kinds of problems. Some wives despise their husbands; they even fight with their husbands. Some children disobey their parents and argue with them. Some servants ignore or argue with their masters when they cannot submit to them. Some ignore the law when they face corrupt officers or unjust legislation. But whether or not our husband, our parents, or our representatives in the government are evil is none of our business. If we have touched authority, we will not criticize them. The whole issue rests on whether or not we have touched authority. Once we have touched authority, these problems are no longer problems. If a person sees only men, he cannot be of any use to the Lord. We have to realize that the systems of authority established among human society are established and ordained by God. Once we touch God and His authority, all problems go away.</p><p>Yesterday we quoted some examples from the Old Testament to illustrate the matter of rebellion. Even though Moses was wrong when he married the Cushite woman, his sister and brother should not have reviled him rashly because he was God's deputy authority. A deputy authority may be wrong, but it is not our business to criticize him. Our business is to submit to authority. Whether or not masters, husbands, parents, and those in authority have a problem in themselves is not our concern. We need to know only one thing: If we do not submit to them, we have a problem. A person who tries to confront God's deputy authority always runs into problems. We may think that our master or our husband is not as good as we are. This thought exists because we have touched these people only. When we only touch people, we encounter problems. But if we touch authority, we will not have a problem. Some servants only touch their masters. Some children only touch their parents. Some only touch their brothers and sisters. These ones do not have a way to go on because they are only touching men; they have not touched authority and are not willing to yield. A person is useless if he continues to criticize the government, those in authority, parents, superiors, or elders in the church. All of his spiritual power will leak away. He is taking the way of Satan and acting according to his principle.</p><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE DIVINE SYSTEM OF AUTHORITY</h2><p>Since the beginning of the world, God has been ruling and upholding the entire universe with His authority. Both man's fall and the fall of the universe had their source in rebellion. Rebellion has thrown off authority. If we do not deal with this basic issue, we will be useless no matter where we go. We will be unable to work in any place. We cannot preach the gospel of Christ and perform God's work or service while taking Satan's way and maintaining his principle. Once we touch and apprehend God's authority, we will know that God created and maintains the universe by His authority. He has placed His system of authority in everything. We have to uphold the system God has ordained. We have to learn to submit to men and not to touch authority in a light way. In all these relationships we have to learn to know authority and practice obedience. We have to know that there are lords and masters in everything; we cannot assume to be the master as soon as we touch something. We have to learn obedience through many situations. One finds authority in the hospital. As soon as he works in a hospital, he has to obey the authority in the hospital. There is even authority in a restaurant. Some serve as managers, and we have to learn to obey them. If we touch authority in a genuine way, we will find authority wherever we go. In obeying the authority of earthly institutions, we are actually obeying God because all authorities are from God. We have to see that every authority is from God. Only a rebellious and proud man is blind to authority; only he will not submit to God's deputy authority. If we cannot submit to His deputy authority, or if we say that we do not sense God's authority on earth today, we are not qualified to touch God's work; we cannot work for the Lord.</p><p>During the past three days, I have stressed authority. I feel that my utterance is still short. Within myself I know what authority is. Brothers and sisters, we have to ask for mercy to see authority. Our inner being has to be so fine that we will feel what Michael felt when he faced Satan's authority. The church on earth bears the testimony of submission. If the church does not submit, what will it be like? We have to learn to obey when placed under all kinds of circumstances and systems. We should never consider one who rebels and offends authority as a hero. A rebellious person is never a hero. If all the sons of God would stand on the ground of submission, the activities of the lawless ones would be suppressed. Second Thessalonians says that the mystery of lawlessness is now operating, but there is one who is now restraining (2:7). Who is this restraining one? He is not a nominal Christian or a rebellious Christian. Our obedience is what prevents the mystery of Satan's lawlessness from operating. This is a fundamental issue. If this issue is not resolved, no work can follow, because we will still be Satan's men. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we see God's authority in all human institutions.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 23, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><p>In the past few days we touched on the matter of authority. Today we will "hit home" on this subject: God's authority in the church. Two falls occurred in this universe, and both have great repercussions. First, there was the fall of the angels; second, there was the fall of man. In both cases God's authority was overthrown. Although both the angels and man fell, God did not withdraw His authority in the universe. God can withdraw His presence, but He will never withdraw His authority. He does not compromise His authority with anything. Where His authority is, there His presence is. When He withdraws His authority, He withdraws His presence as well. The fall of the angels did not cause Him to turn away; He did not give up His creation as a result of the angels' fall. Nor did man's fall turn Him away. He did not give up the man whom He created. He is still in control of this world, and He is still upholding the system of authority through government, family, and other human relationships. Of course, none of the authorities within these relationships can be compared with the authority in the church. God asserts Himself through asserting His authority. Where authority is, God's presence can be found. In fact, the best way to prove God's existence or presence is through the demonstration of His authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE PLACE<br />WHERE GOD'S AUTHORITY IS MAINTAINED</h2><p>I would like the brothers and sisters to know one thing: Even though God has not withdrawn His authority, and even though His authority is still felt throughout the world and the universe, man daily trespasses against this authority. Every day we find lawlessness operating on earth. Every day man is under rebellion, plotting against God's authority. In addition, fallen angels, evil spirits, and Satan himself offend God's authority daily. Such a situation cannot go on forever; God's authority cannot be challenged forever. According to His desire, plan, and work, God will establish a kingdom on earth. Within the realm of this kingdom, His authority will rule. Every person within this realm will submit to His authority; no one will trespass it. This realm defines the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the kingdom of God, which is the church. God intends to bring order into the chaotic world and chaotic universe. Within the realm of the church, there should be submission everywhere; everything should be under God's almighty rule and should be joined to the heavens. This is the church. This is the kingdom of the heavens, and it is here that God establishes His kingdom. How great the responsibility of the church is! In the midst of chaos and rebellion, God is upholding His authority. If the church joins in this rebellion, God will have no way to go on.</p><p>In the past few days we have seen Israel's rebellion. We have seen how the children of Israel rebelled against Moses and Aaron. By the time of Judges, the people of Israel were in a state of total collapse and confusion. Then God established the kingdom of Israel, asserting His authority through David. Even before David died, however, rebellion had already broken out. After Solomon passed away, the rebellion grew worse. From the time of Rehoboam's idolatry to the dividing of the northern and southern kingdoms, the people were in constant rebellion. This rebellion continued until the time of their captivity. His attempt to establish authority among the Israelites failed. Four hundred years later, starting with John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was preached, and those who were violent took it by force. The prophecies of the prophets and the law ended with John (Matt. 11:12-13). First God sent Elijah, and then He sent His own Son to be a model of obedience to His people. After this God began to build up the church. The church should continue the line of obedience; it should be a vessel of obedience. Yet the church failed; it did not fully obey God's authority nor fully submit to His direct will. God has yet to recover His authority on earth.</p><p>In spite of this, God's will must go on; it must go on until it reaches perfection as recorded in Ephesians 4 and 5. The Lord has to do great things in the church in the end times. Otherwise, a glorious church will not be ready for God. A man has to touch God's authority. He must not fight against any authority, and he must not have a spirit of rebellion. This is the way to serve God according to the divine principle. Unless one serves this way, his work, preaching, and service will be worthless because he will be operating according to Satan's principle. This matter is too crucial. Perhaps some among us will not be able to take this word. Today I am only touching the subject briefly. What is the kingdom, and what is the church? The church as the kingdom is a group of people who uphold God's authority on earth. God's authority is established in the church. The church is the firstfruit. If the church rebels against God's authority, His authority will never be established. Let me give an illustration. When General Chiang Kai-shek had the thought of unifying China, he first established the Whampoa Military Academy. Through it he trained an army and unified the country. What would have happened if the academy had turned against him before he was able to complete the unification? The unification plan would have collapsed. God's will begins with the church. Through the church He establishes His authority. According to God's plan, His authority is established directly and indirectly through the church. One day the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and our Christ. If the church rebels and fails to be a testimony of obedience, God's plan will be totally frustrated.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING OBEDIENCE IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>God must secure a group of people who are absolutely submissive to civil authorities. According to Romans 13:1-7, they should render tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due. In the family there should also be order and authority. One should be a submissive wife, obedient child, or obedient servant. We should maintain our standing and submit to authority in every circumstance. This kind of behavior and attitude constitutes the best testimony. Nothing can be more beautiful in the world than seeing submission in every circumstance. Those who practice this are expressing God's glory and God's authority. We are not submitting to a person when we submit to authority. We are submitting to God. In order to take care of the sense of the spirit within us, we submit to deputy authority. Those who know authority will submit to authority wherever they find it. A brother who listens to only one man is not useful because he is submitting only to man; he has not seen God's authority. Once a man touches God's authority, he can submit to any authority.</p><p>We should submit to authority wherever we are. There is one brother in Foochow who only obeys a certain person. Another brother will not take any word from Brother Chen or Brother Zheng. In Shanghai there is a sister who only responds to the words of Sister Wang and Sister Lee. They are only obeying men; they are not submitting to authority. Submission to authority has nothing to do with persons. We have to touch authority in the kitchen. We have to touch authority in our office. Whenever we find responsible brothers in the church, we find authority. We find the system of authority everywhere. If a man thinks that he needs to only submit to one person, he has not seen authority. Submission is not directed toward one or two persons; it is directed toward all authorities. We must have a feeling for authority. This is not a matter of being polite and careful. We have to have a spirit of submission, a feeling for submission. A person who has touched God's authority once will know it as soon as he touches it. The sisters who are in charge of the kitchen have their authority. If we step into the kitchen we have to obey them. This does not mean that we have to be polite to them and take care to not offend them like those in the world. What we need is a sense of authority. Such a sense comes spontaneously. It is like the feeling an arm has when it is twisted; the feeling of pain is there spontaneously. Those who know divine authority will identify it as soon as they touch it. If a brother says that everyone's word is wrong and that only Brother Witness's or Sister Wang's words are right, he is an outsider as far as spiritual matters are concerned.</p><p>God is looking for a group of people on earth who will not offend or rebel against authority. If a man truly knows authority, his submission will be spontaneous. This is not a matter of politeness. A Christian does not need politeness; he needs a sense of submission. If such a sense is present in the church, the coordination between the brothers and sisters will be spontaneous. Without this the church will be in confusion. We may say that we are submitting to eight or ten persons, but the result of this submission will still be confusion. We need to submit to all authorities. In the church the absence of obedience brings in confusion. Confusion is equally brought in by an obedience to only one or a few persons. The whole issue rests on whether or not we have touched authority. What is God upholding on earth today? He is upholding authority. If a man destroys God's authority, any work, consecration, service, or zeal will be a form of rebellion. It will be nothing but an offense to His authority. Unless we can sense the evil of rebellion and insubordination, we are useless in the work of God. God upholds His authority. If we destroy this authority, we will have no way to go on.</p><p>This matter needs to be fundamentally resolved before the Lord. Unless we settle this, we may not get into trouble when we are on the mountain, but we will certainly get into trouble when we leave. If a man errs in this matter, he may not get into trouble in one place, but he will get into trouble in another place. It is not enough for the brothers from Chefoo to obey Brother Witness alone; they have to find authority wherever they go and submit to it. In order to be obedient wherever we are, we have to see that God alone is the authority and that all authorities are from God. Authority is a mysterious thing. No one knows what authority really is. It is hard to describe authority. This is something as mysterious as God. But once a man touches it, he feels that he has touched God because God is Spirit in Himself, but God is authority in His manifestation. We are speaking about touching authority; we are not arguing about who should obey whom. Those who argue about such things are in depravity. May the Lord have mercy on them. A worker must ask if he is submitting to God's authority. One does not become a worker by being eloquent, persuasive, or capable. Some sisters find it hard to submit to brothers. Some wives find it hard to submit to their husbands. Some children find it hard to submit to their parents. Some servants find it hard to submit to their masters. It is hard for them because they have only touched men. Saul had to be enlightened by the light and fall by the wayside before he could exclaim, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). Once a man sees authority, all critical thoughts against police, government, husbands, parents, and brothers and sisters will go away. Once a man touches authority, all of his problems are solved. A servant of the Lord must touch authority and submit to authority. If he does not settle the issue of authority, he will have no way to go on.</p><h2 class="head1">A SUBMISSIVE CHARACTER</h2><p>Everyone who knows God's authority has a distinctive habit: He looks for authority wherever he goes. The first thing he asks when he goes to a place is who the authority is. There is an urge within him to ask, "To whom should I listen?" He does not say this with just his mouth; he manifests a need for submission within his very being. Submission becomes his very character. It is a characteristic of God's children to obey. This is the way a person acts when he touches authority. Under every circumstance, wherever he is, he looks for authority, for men to be above him. Wherever he goes, he finds the order of divine authority. If a good number of people gather together in a place, and they see things this way, there will be order in that place. God has placed order and authority in the universe, in the world, and in the church. Whether or not someone is good in our eyes and whether or not we approve of him, we have to thank the Lord for setting him up as an object for our submission. It is not a matter of who the person is, but a matter of the authority he has. If we cannot submit to him, we cannot excuse ourselves by saying that we are ignorant of authority. The only thing we can say about ourselves is that we are in rebellion. Those who know authority immediately know when a person is not in submission. When we say that we have to look for objects for submission, we do not mean that we have to look for an imperial officer to whom we should pay homage. We are saying that we have to submit to all deputy authorities. Wherever we go and under every circumstance, we have to look for objects for submission. If a brother or a sister says that he or she cannot submit to a certain person, there is something basically wrong with the nature of his or her Christian character.</p><p>When our Lord was young, He submitted to His parents. When He began His preaching at the age of thirty, a collector of the temple tax came to Peter and asked if his master would pay the temple tax. Peter answered the man, "Yes." After he came into the house, the Lord took the initiative to ask Peter, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?" Peter answered, "From strangers." The Lord then said, "So then the sons are free." But in order not to stumble them, the Lord asked Peter to go to the sea and cast a hook. Peter then found a stater in the mouth of the fish to pay the tax (Matt. 17:24-27). This incident speaks to us of authority. The Lord is the Son of God. Before He revealed Himself, men did not know Him. As far as His status as the Son of God is concerned, He did not have to pay the tax. In order not to stumble others, however, He paid it. Before He revealed His status as the Son of God, He subjected Himself to earthly authorities. He was the Son, and it was wrong for Him to pay the tax Himself because in so doing, it would imply a denial of His sonship. This is the reason He did not take the money from His pocket but paid it through other means instead. He ordered the stater to be taken from the mouth of the fish, and He used it to pay the tax. He paid His share, and He also took care of Peter's share.</p><p>When the Lord was judged by the high priest, He did not answer at first. But when the high priest charged Him by the living God to answer, He responded. This is another example of the Lord submitting to authority. This is the Lord's nature. As God's sons, we also have God's nature, which is a nature of submission. There is something within us that wants to submit. This is the characteristic of the nature within us. In the past we paid considerable attention to holiness but not enough attention to authority. Today we have to pay more attention to authority. We have to know that the nature God has given us is obedient and submissive. If we are not obedient and submissive, we feel inwardly unhappy; something within us will not let us go. If we have objects for submission around us today, but do not want to submit, I seriously question the kind of life we have received.</p><p>Here I must first ask for your forgiveness. In the past there have been many things which I was hesitant to speak about. I know that the time has come, and that I have to speak strong words to you. If your heart is set on submission, these words will be sweet to you! You were born in uncleanness but were saved and brought into the way of holiness. You appreciated the life that you received and felt inwardly relieved and refreshed. You will have the feeling again today if you are led by the Lord to choose obedience, to take obedience, to seek obedience, and to take care of the spirit of obedience. Actually, this feels so much better than merely advancing from uncleanness to holiness. What a joy this affords! You will thank and praise Him loudly, saying, "How sweet obedience is!" So many of our brothers and sisters are not happy or at peace because they are not willing to obey. Others are entering joy and rest through obedience. I know, of course, that certain factors make obedience difficult. Those in such circumstances must shed many tears in order to take the way of obedience. If, however, they obey in tears, they will be rewarded with joy and sweetness. May the Lord open your eyes to see that the life you have received is a life of submission.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY OF SUBMISSION</h2><p>Today God requires that we take a strong stand under all circumstances, at all times, and in the midst of all kinds of environments. We should obey God, and we should obey those whom He has chosen. God needs a group of people who will submit to deputy authority. God desires to see men who will be sensitive to His authority as soon as it is manifested. Such ones are obedient and submissive, and they uphold God's authority. They look for authority everywhere they go, and they submit to this authority. They are neither rebellious nor defiant. Once God finds such men, He has a testimony. His urgent need today is to find expressions of authority as well as testimonies of submission. When God's authority and man's submission meet, we have a testimony that is after God's heart. What a glory it will be if we have three or five brothers and sisters who know authority and submission. Today we hear noise and words everywhere, and we find confusion, friction, and defiance everywhere. What a difference it would make if we had a group of brothers and sisters who realized God's authority and who submitted to this authority! This would bring men face to face with something real. If a place has a testimony of submission, it will find a greater and greater expression of God's authority. The degree of the manifestation of authority depends on the amount of submission. The more manifest the submission, the more expression of authority there is, and the greater the revelation of God there is. If we are this way, even a casual onlooker will know that the local church is different. They will say that God is here. This is the way of our testimony. When a family has a head and there is authority and submission in the family, others will find order in it. No matter where we go, we have to see authority.</p><p>The whole world is in rebellion today. Rebellion lies in man's very nature. When a man acts according to his own nature, he rebels. Today everyone likes to say that this is the age of democracy, and that he is the master of himself. The flesh loves to be in defiance! It loves to go along with its own nature and rebel! Yet a man who has seen God's authority will smell rebellion as soon as it is around. God is high on the throne. He is the God above the heavens. His authority must be honored. How can we uplift ourselves and crave to be our own masters? How can we crave to be equal with God? We have to confess our sins before God, and we have to admit that we are lawless and rebellious men. Since we were saved, how often have we tried to rebel, to turn back, to refuse coordination, to act independently, and to be insubordinate and stubborn? We have to confess these sins.</p><p>If the church cannot get through in the matter of authority, it cannot take up any work or service. I have to shout and repeat a thousand times, even ten thousand times, that we need the testimony of submission in the church. Every time a preacher of the Word preaches, and every time a minister speaks for God, he has to be inwardly sensitive. If you are speaking about submission, and some in the audience are opposing, rebelling, or setting themselves up against you, you will not be able to say any strong words. Your spirit will shrink back. You will not be able to speak with ease and freedom. I have spoken on wives submitting to husbands, servants submitting to masters, and children submitting to parents many times. I do not remember once when I did not encounter any resistance. If a man has not touched God's authority, something in him will be hard as soon as you touch him. The testimony of Jesus has nothing to do with doctrines or teachings. God must have a group of people who are not only holy, righteous, and loving, but who are able to give others the impression that they have a spirit of submission, that is, that they submit to authority. Our testimony is not a lucid exposition of the truth. Genuine testimony is the operation of the spirit of submission among us. If this situation is found among us, God's authority will reign in the church, and God will have a free way to go on. What a beautiful picture it will be when all the brothers and sisters seek submission wherever they go, when the whole church has its head covered, when no one has any personal opinion, loose tongue, or presumptuous thought, and when obedience is manifested on all sides! This should be our testimony. If we build up everything except this one thing, our service will be useless.</p><p>In today's world and in the church, there are many language interpreters. They interpret and communicate. An interpreter translates words that you do not understand into words that you do understand. If the matter of authority is not effectively communicated to you today, your stay on the mountain will be nothing but a torture to your very life. From now on you have to look for authority wherever you go. To look for authority means that you do not try to be the master, head, or lord of your house. If such a submission is manifested in the church today, what an unprecedented highway it will give to the Lord! When others see this, they will bow down and worship the Lord. We can find brotherly love in many places, but we hardly can find submission. It is the most beautiful thing to find brotherly love among the saints on the one hand and mutual submission on the other hand. Submission without brotherly love is Catholicism. Brotherly love without submission is Brethrenism, and if both brotherly love and submission are absent, we have Protestantism. In Christianity we find three different kinds of conditions, characterized by Catholicism, Brethrenism, and Protestantism. We should not belong to any one of them. We should not practice submission at the expense of brotherly love, nor should we practice brotherly love at the expense of submission. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our brotherly love will increase while our submission will not be lacking. We have to take a firm stand and submit to authority. This should be our testimony. It is something that is rare to find today.</p><p>Today a testimony of submission cannot be found anywhere in the world or in the universe. This is the reason God has ordained authority in the church. He expects to find His authority expressed through the church. For years we have experienced great confusion, rebellion, and insubordination. We have to confess our sins to the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us. May we see the system of authority He has ordained in the church, and may we become a testimony of submission to authority.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />SUBMISSION AND SPEAKING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 24, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Pet. 2:10-12</h1><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION BEING THE VERY NATURE<br />OF THE SONS OF GOD</h2><p>Yesterday we spoke of God's desire to manifest His authority in the church. Those who are in the church should submit to authority. The Bible has a few words to say concerning the Christian pathway. Romans 10:16 says that a man is saved through obeying the gospel. This means that the gospel is a command. Romans 10:16, 1 Peter 4:17, and 2 Thessalonians 1:8 all speak of obeying the gospel. Romans 2:8 and 1 Peter 1:22 speak of obeying the truth (which is God's word). God's gospel is a command, and God's truth is also a command. This is the reason the Bible says that we should obey both the gospel and the truth. Obeying carries a more positive sense than submitting. First Peter 3:1 speaks of those who disobey the word. Hebrews 5:9 says that Christ became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation. In other words, God saves those who obey Him. Acts 5:32 says that God has given the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him. Therefore, obedience is a characteristic of a Christian. The name Christian implies those who obey. It is better to call a believer an "obeyer." A Christian is an "obeyer" because this is the virtue, characteristic, and nature of God's children. God can only get what He wants from the church because outside the realm of the church everything is in rebellion against God. If we do not express God's authority in the church, we have given up His very own nature.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH CANNOT FAIL</h2><p>The church as God's chosen vessel is the last "obeyer." For this reason we should not be defeated in the church. We cannot be allowed or permitted to be defeated. God chose the angels, but they failed. He chose the Israelites, but they failed as well. The church cannot fail again. Fukien natives try to make new vessels out of spoiled ones. God's final work, however, is with the church. If the church fails, God cannot have any more work. We have no choice but to obey. We cannot rebel, because God has no further work. God sent Moses, David, and the prophets to the world. Finally Christ came. In God's economy the church is God's final work. You may be obedient or rebellious. God, however, must gain His vessel&mdash;the church. You must have the realization that the church has only one way to go&mdash;to overcome; it cannot fail. It has to be holy and without blemish, free from spots or wrinkles, as described in Ephesians 5. The Lord is building the church upon the rock, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it (Matt. 16:18). The church has no other choice but to overcome. The Lord will perfect the church. It cannot fail God again.</p><p>Some time ago someone asked, "What would happen if we failed again?" We should not ask such a question. We have to overcome. We should not ask, "What would happen if the Lord failed?" The Lord cannot fail; He must overcome. Similarly, we should not ask, "What would happen if we failed?" Such a thought should never enter the mind of the church. We should be nothing but absolute. We must overcome. Just as it was unthinkable for the Lord to sin, it should be unthinkable for the church to fail.</p><p>Josephus was a Jewish historian. He did not believe in Christ. According to his history, demon possession was running rampant when Christ was walking on earth. It seems as if the entire army of Hades rose up against Him. In the end, however, the Lord overcame them all. Therefore, the church must take the way of submission. The destiny of the church is victory. Whether or not we want to submit, we have to submit. God is God, and He never changes. His throne remains forever. The church cannot turn back. Our way today is to be the "obeyer." This is a tremendous way. Who can frustrate God's way? Who are you? Can you frustrate God's will?</p><p>Sometimes I laugh to myself, saying, "How can a tiny, rebellious, and defiant worldling withstand God's way?" The Lord only needs to move His little finger slightly and everything will be cleared up. Only an omnipotent one can say that he does not need to submit to anyone. We are not qualified to say such a word. As soon as we appear before God, before His plan, and before His word, we have to bow down.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />SUBMISSION AND OUR SPEAKING</h2><h2 class="head2">The First Manifestation of Rebellion<br />Being One's Speaking</h2><p>Today we will cover the relationship between authority and speaking. The entire Scripture tells us clearly that a very close relationship exists between speaking and submission. God wants man to submit to authority. He also wants man to be submissive in his speaking. If a man cannot be submissive in his speaking, it is vain to ask him to submit to any authority. Second Peter 2:10-12 first speaks of the flesh and lust and then of those who despise lordships. Those who are undisciplined in the flesh and wanton in lust despise lordship; they are not under any authority. Those who walk soberly and who are under the discipline of the Holy Spirit do not revile dignitaries. Peter said that some are not submissive, that they despise lordship. The outward manifestation of this inward state is a reviling in the mouth. When reviling is expressed in words, it becomes an evil speaking. The first mark of rebellion is in speaking, that is, in one's evil speaking. The tongue is the hardest member to tame. It is the smallest of all members, yet it can boast great things and is set on fire by Gehenna (James 3:5-6). The quickest outward sign of defiance of authority is the exercise of the tongue.</p><p>In the world there are those who are in the position of authority and those who should submit to authority. Those who should submit often merely perform perfunctory ceremonies. They pay homage and say "yes" to everything, but behind the back, they say evil things. Suppose you ask a servant to do something. He may respond immediately, but as soon as he gets into the kitchen, he complains and murmurs. This is often the case with employees toward employers. The employees nod their heads at their employers' faces but speak evilly behind their backs. The same is true with soldiers towards officers or nurses towards doctors. The mouth is the most free to speak. On the one hand, the mouth expresses the heart. On the other hand, the mouth is free to say anything. In a court of law, judges often conclude cases by saying to the defendants, "If you want to challenge this decision, you have three days to appeal to a higher court." Many condemned ones choose not to appeal because they know that they are guilty. This does not mean, however, that they yield to the judgment. They murmur privately and utter many evil words. Students treat their teachers the same way in school. They nod their head at their teachers' faces, but speak evilly of them behind their back. We also find this in a family between children and parents. This is what Paul called "eye-service" (Col. 3:22). It is an obedience performed before one's eyes, not an obedience which issues from the heart. When there is no obedience in the heart, the mouth can only utter words of rebellion. Rebellion is seen everywhere among all systems of secular authorities. Submission is a yielding of the heart as well as the mouth. We only need to see whether or not a person is submissive in his speaking in order to know if he is submissive. God wants man not only to be submissive before the eyes of others, but also in the heart and in the mouth. Privately, we must always bridle our tongue.</p><p>In the world one is considered obedient as long as he yields outwardly, but among God's children, those who are serving Him, there should be submission from the heart and no reviling words out of the mouth. This is true in the family, toward the government, and in the church. A man can refrain from murmuring against God because he has met God. Those who have never touched God's authority will always have a problem. Their problem is like a man's temper, which can be held back only for a day or two or for a few months. Sooner or later, his temper will explode. Some people are like time-delayed bombs. They do not explode immediately, but when the time comes, they explode. It is not enough for a man to touch the elders or the workers as persons. It is not enough for a wife to touch her husband as a person. We need to touch authority. I am not here to teach submission. I am praying that we will touch God and touch authority. I am hoping that we will look for opportunities to submit. As soon as we touch God's authority, we will have nothing more to say. God has to bring us to the point where we will not murmur in our heart or speak rebellion with our mouth. How good and liberating such an experience is!</p><p>Second Peter 2:10 says that those who despise lordship "do not tremble while reviling dignities." Some people do not tremble while they rebel against authority, but those who know God tremble for them. It is a serious thing for a man to not tremble. It is like a little child standing before a tiger and pulling its hair without any fear. Many sisters speak rebelliously against their husbands, and many brothers and sisters maliciously prate against the responsible brothers in the church. They do not tremble, but those who know authority tremble for them. If we want to practice submission, first we must bridle our mouth. The first area we should tackle is our speaking.</p><p>Second Peter 2:11 tells us that even though angels are powerful, they do not accuse those in position before the Lord. First learn from the angels! They are powerful and occupy high places, yet they are submissive. If we do not submit, we are saying that we are greater than the angels. As far as their power and authority are concerned, the angels are greater than man. Yet they would not speak a reviling word. Who are you? Angels dare not speak rashly because they keep their place. Those who know authority never criticize easily. The angels have learned to keep their place before God; they are submissive to authority. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 11:10 says that the woman should have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of angels.</p><p>If a Christian does not submit to authority, he loses all of his power. There are two reasons that Christians lose their power. The first is sin, and the second is rebellion. The greatest sign of rebellion is reviling words that issue from the mouth. It is impossible for a spring to gush forth sweet and bitter water together (James 3:11). Once we gush forth bitter water, the sweet water is gone. The same mouth cannot speak reviling words and words of love at the same time. This is particularly true with a minister of God's word. He cannot revile men with his mouth and then a few minutes later use the same mouth to edify men. A great cause of loss of power in a Christian is rebellion against authority through reviling with his mouth.</p><h2 class="head2">Offense against Authority Being the Gravest Sin</h2><p>Following 2 Peter 2:10-11, Peter gave a very strong word: "But these, like animals without reason, born natural for capture and destruction, reviling in things of which they are ignorant, will also in their corrupting of others be destroyed" (v. 12). This is a most solemn word in the Bible. No word of condemnation is stronger than 2 Peter 2:10-12. Why was Peter so severe in his condemnation? Many sins are considered to be serious by man. Peter, however, realized that the most serious sin in the eyes of God is rebellion against authority. Every day newspapers criticize those in authority, yet Christians read them and even talk about them. In today's society, reviling against those in authority has become all too common. Many people speak against those in authority without having any feeling about it at all. Throughout the Bible God has been upholding His authority. Offense against authority is the greatest sin. God will deal with anyone who sets himself up to overthrow authority. God does not call those who murder or commit adultery "animals without reason." Unlike those who revile, a murderer or adulterer may have some feeling. But those who revile are void of feelings. God considers a reviler an animal, for he is void of feelings. Does a dog feel remorseful after he bites a person? Does he lose his appetite for three days and feel sorrow for himself? Authority is the central theme throughout the entire Bible. Reviling is the greatest sin to God. Brothers and sisters, I hope that we will have a proper feeling within. I hope no one will open his mouth rashly.</p><h2 class="head2">Reviling Words Frustrating<br />the Building of the Church</h2><p>The biggest reason for the loss of oneness in the church and the loss of power is carelessness with the tongue. If the whole church is filled with grudges and murmurings, how can it be built up? If God can seal up our mouths, He can do many things. Who would dare criticize God? Some like to say, "If this is of God, I have nothing to say." Those who speak such words have not seen authority. It is not a matter of gritting our teeth while rebellion is fermenting in our heart. It is a matter of the total eradication of the thought from its root. If a spiritual person speaks to us, we may not understand some of the things he says. If a more spiritual person comes to us, we may not understand much of the things he says. Carrying this argument further, how much of what God would speak to us would be understandable to us? The world criticizes according to what it knows. Yet there are those who criticize freely even though they know little. Do we criticize because we know or because we do not know? When some people criticize, they demonstrate their wisdom. When other people criticize, they demonstrate their stupidity. Many people criticize others because they are unaware of their own foolishness. The more a person knows God, the less he will dare to criticize. He will feel that there are many spiritual things which he does not know. Anyone who destroys authority with his words will find himself destroyed by God.</p><h2 class="head2">Michael's Example</h2><p>Jude 8-10 and 2 Peter 2:10-12 are written in the same tone. In particular, verse 8 of Jude is almost identical to 2 Peter 2:10. We can conclude that these passages are inspired by God because Jude and Peter never had a conference before they wrote their respective books. Despising lordship always leads to reviling and loose speaking. These two things are always linked to each other. The result of despising lordship is reviling and loose talk. It is a mark of defiance for a person to speak loosely. The thing to notice in Jude 9 is that Michael bridled his speaking rather than any other action in his dispute with Satan over Moses' body. He remembered that Satan was formerly his superior. He was faced with an authority that was at one time higher than his own, and he refrained from speaking rashly. He dared not say to Satan, "You are wrong. You should not have caused so much trouble." He only said, "The Lord rebuke you." He dared not say anything to revile Satan. (Of course, we are different from Michael. We were never under Satan. Moreover, we are those who are dead in Christ. Satan cannot do anything to those who are dead; he can only work on those who are living.) Michael was an archangel of God. He received orders from God to deal with Satan. The Bible records this as a pattern for us to follow. We have to be taught how to speak. The Bible gives us this pattern. It shows that we can invoke other authorities to deal with the authority above us. However, we cannot open our own mouth rashly, and we cannot execute judgment with our own hands. A man must first have the ears of a learner before he can have the tongue of a learner. After speaking of the story of Michael, Jude continued his discourse by pointing out the result of reviling, which is the bringing about of destruction to oneself. The result of reviling is to destroy oneself. It also exposes one's foolishness and spiritual predicament. The first lesson we have to learn is to bridle our tongues and refrain from reviling.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF REBELLIOUS SPEAKINGS<br />IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Ham's Speaking</h2><p>In the Old Testament Noah's son discovered the nakedness of his father. He went out and told his brothers. Apparently, he was merely passing on words, but actually he was acting according to the principle of rebellion. He had a spirit of rebellion, and this rebellion was manifested in the way he spoke. Had he humbled himself under authority, he would not have dared to pass on any word. Anyone who desires to learn submission must refrain from passing on words that undermine authority. We have to be restrained in words. The unnecessary spreading of words has caused much havoc. We should never be those who spread unnecessary words to others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reviling of Aaron and Miriam</h2><p>There is also the story of Aaron and Miriam reviling Moses. Although Aaron served alongside Moses, God's calling was to Moses. His calling to Aaron was a result of His calling to Moses. Miriam's calling was an adjunct to the two. Moses' calling was an independent calling. Aaron and Miriam's callings were not independent; they were part of Moses' calling. If Moses had not received a calling, Aaron and Miriam would not have been called. Aaron and Miriam were older than Moses in the flesh, but in God's work, Moses was greater. He was the deputy authority. I cannot tell you the reason for this. I can only say that God likes to do things this way. Aaron and Miriam did not want to submit to Moses' authority, and words escaped their mouths. When they saw that Moses had married a Cushite, they reviled him, saying, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" The Bible says, "And Jehovah heard it" (Num. 12:2). As soon as a man has a spirit of rebellion within him, his mouth reveals it. The proper exercise of authority, however, will shut up many mouths. If a man knows authority, he will stop much noise and many questions. Authority seals up not just the words and noise but questions as well. When a spirit of submission is present, many questions are automatically answered. Everyone who has touched authority submits to God's arrangements. Aaron might have thought that Moses was just his brother and that he had stroked Moses' head and even disciplined him from his youth. What was wrong with rebuking him a little now? He only said one thing: "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" We do not know if he had spoken to anyone else about Moses' affairs or reviled him or challenged his leadership for marrying a Gentile. It seems as if Aaron and Miriam did not say anything serious at all. We may feel that their words were not very serious. We may think that such words could not easily be considered as reviling, but the Bible says that Aaron and Miriam reviled Moses. God understood their words to be a reviling. As soon as we move our little finger, God knows what we are doing. He knows whether or not there is any rebellion within us. There was nothing special about Moses to Aaron and Miriam, but in God's eyes Moses was His chosen authority. Any word that carries a spirit of rebellion, whether it is casual or serious, constitutes rebellion. It is hard to ask a rebellious person to refrain from reviling words.</p><h2 class="head2">The Attack of Korah's Company against Moses</h2><p>Numbers 16 speaks of the rebellion of Korah's company, Dathan and Abiram of the tribe of Reuben, and the two hundred and fifty leaders. Their rebellion was also characterized by their speaking. This rebellion was larger in scope than the previous one. Numbers 16 tells us that they accused Moses and Aaron of having gone too far and of exalting themselves above the congregation of the Lord. Their attack became a reviling. Their rebellion burst out like a flood and opened the door of Sheol. This was a serious rebellion. Their words became absolutely unrestrained. In order to serve God, we have to find authority everywhere. We have to learn to be submissive in our attitude and our words. In order to learn submission, we have to be faithful in the way we speak. We must not open our mouth loosely.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY SHUTS UP REVILING</h2><p>Once we take proper instructions in the matter of submission, we will realize that the condition of the church today is a mess. We cannot find order and authority anywhere. If God grants many of us the leading to touch His authority for the next three to five years, we will realize the contrast between the confusions of the past and the excellence that is in the church. We can find a resemblance of this feeling in the matter of salvation. Formerly, we did not have the assurance of salvation nor a grasp of the content of salvation. As a result, we had little feeling for the matter of salvation. Today everyone knows how great salvation is, and the church's feeling toward this matter has changed. Formerly, the church was not clear about salvation because the way was not clear. The same can be said about authority. We must see authority. Once we see authority, we will realize the multiplicity of our words and their evil. They convey nothing but reviling, gossip, and rebellion. By the Lord's mercy, we will touch authority, and we will not dare to speak rashly. Our knowledge of authority is linked to our speaking. If we cannot control our mouth, we cannot control our own person either. The kind of mouth we have determines the kind of person we are. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34). This is a law.</p><p>We have to deal with a rebellious mouth. We have to deal with reviling words. Yet we cannot deal with rebellion by ourselves. God can. If God gives us the grace to touch authority a little, we will discover something restraining us as soon as we try to speak in a light way. We will not be able to say what we want to say; our words will be stopped. This is not a matter of outward change. Once we know authority, our speaking will change. During the past twenty years, we have not been free to speak about authority. Putting the whole matter in simple words: We have to touch God's authority. It is not the amount of change in the outward man or in our words that matters. As soon as we touch authority, we will become different. We will fall on our knees, and our entire being will wilt away. We will no longer dare revile or criticize. Our mouth will be shut. May the Lord have mercy on us so that no rebellious spirit or rebellious words will be found in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION<br />OF GOD'S AUTHORITY&mdash;<br />THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 25, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Today we will speak about the ultimate expression of God's authority and where it lies. God is authority, and God also ordains authority. In creating the universe God exercised His authority, and He instituted authority in the world, in human government, and in all human relationships. God also established a kingdom and instituted His authority in this kingdom. God desires to manifest authority through Himself, through His kingdom, and through all human relationships. For God to manifest His authority is for Him to manifest Himself. However, these institutions merely express the principles of authority. Although there are many things in the world that enforce outward submission, man is not submissive at heart. Rebellion characterizes half of all human activities, while lip service characterizes the other half. God has not fully secured the authority which He intends to build up in the universe. His authority has not found the proper expression in all these areas. God's authority is not manifested in many human governments or human relationships. Mainly, God has received man's lip service. Many people submit to authority outwardly but not in the heart. This is the reason God's plan is still not fulfilled. Therefore, God needs an instrument or institution to express His authority. This institution is the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING<br />THE PERFECT MANIFESTATION OF GOD'S AUTHORITY</h2><p>God desires to express His authority through the church. Many people do not realize that the church is a crucial and solemn institution. God must carry out His will fully through the church; the church cannot afford any hindrance to Him. If a man does not see the seriousness of this matter, he may presume the church to be nothing but a gathering of Christians, a society of brotherly and sisterly love. He may consider the church a mere gathering of men with the same faith or same love who cherish the same future hope. However, God has a different view toward the church. In man's eyes the church is an organization, a gathering of men with kindred love, but God's view is different. He considers the church to be the Body of Christ. God has made Christ the Head of the church. The church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23); it is not merely the gathering of men with similar goals. The relationship between Christ and the church in God's ordination is a relationship between the Head and the Body.</p><p>No institution on earth can express the submission of the human body to its head. The submission of the body to the head is the ultimate expression of authority. The union and harmony between the head and the body is altogether profound. Nothing manifests divine authority more profoundly than the submission of the body to the head. There is a possibility of dissolution in social relationships as between father and son, master and servant, and husband and wife. However, the body can never be detached from the head. One cannot dissolve the relationship between the body and the head because this would deny the very existence of the life of the body. When the bonds between husband and wife, father and son, and master and servant are broken, each can still exist. This, however, is not true of the body and the head. No submission, such as that of servants to masters, wives to husbands, or sons to fathers, can be as perfect as the submission of the members to the head. The obedience of the ears and the eyes to the head is the most perfect obedience. Between the members and the head, there is authority, and there is life union; this relationship is living and organic. Even the most submissive person in the whole world cannot compare his submission to that which exists between the hand and the head. As soon as the head decides, the hand acts. The eyes do not need the head to tell them explicitly what to see; they do not need explicit commands to see. The instant the head desires to see something, the eyes see it. This is a oneness and submission that come out of an inward harmony. This is the Body of Christ. The Body life is the ultimate and perfect manifestation of authority. God has not found such a total and ultimate manifestation of authority in the universe, the world, or any human relationships. He has to begin with the Body of Christ. From this Body He intends to build up His system of authority in the universe, the world, and the kingdom.</p><p>God twice appointed a head in this universe. The first, the original archangel of the universe, rebelled. The second, Christ, accomplished God's purpose. God has established His authority in six spheres. The first is the original universe. The second is the present world. The third is the kingdom of Israel. Then there is the church, which is the Body of Christ. Fifth, there is the kingdom, and finally, there is eternity. The Body of Christ is in the middle of these six spheres. The first three spheres are linked to and ushered into the future kingdom through the Body of Christ. Satan rebelled, and the world as well as the kingdom of Israel have failed God's purpose. The church, however, as the Body of Christ, will bring in God's system of authority. After the Body of Christ there is the kingdom. After the kingdom, the entire universe will belong to God. The first three attempts of God's work failed, but the last three moves will succeed. In the middle there is the transition, or the turning point, which is the church, the Body of Christ.</p><p>We are not here to engage in exegesis or Bible study. Our intention is not merely to understand the doctrines of the Bible but to be those who echo God's heart's desire. We have to realize the importance of our position. God has given us the highest place and the greatest honor. No other group of people is as blessed as we are, and no other group has as much expectation and hope as we have. However, this means that God's demand for the church is much higher. If we do not see authority, we are basically unqualified to meet God's demand, and there is no way for us to go on. Privately, I have been praying, "God, open my eyes to see what the church is." God's church is a group of people who bear the responsibility of expressing God's authority. God has bestowed this honor upon us for the purpose of accomplishing His goal. If authority is not manifested among us, we have no way to go on. If we do not settle this issue among us, it will not be settled in any other place. The whole church bears the responsibility of expressing God's authority before Him. All of us have to bear this responsibility.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HEAD AND THE BODY BEING ABSOLUTELY ONE</h2><p>When God created the heavens and the earth, He also created the angels. Angels are spirits, and they are distinct from God Himself. Later God created man. Man is a soul, and he is also distinct from God Himself. Until the age of the kingdom, man has the freedom to obey or disobey God. When God created the church, however, He created a Body. Christ Himself is our Head. The life which God has put in us is the same life that is in Christ. We can be one with Christ because we bear Christ's nature. The Head and the Body are absolutely in union; the submission found here is absolute. There is no friction between the Head and the Body; the Head spontaneously directs all the members of the Body, and the members of the Body spontaneously obey the Head. When the human head initiates something, the body physiologically responds in certain ways. Psychological activity triggers physiological activity. The transmission between the psyche and the body is wonderful. When an idea comes to the mind, it is transmitted to the members through the nervous system, and the members act accordingly. This is the mystery of the body. We do not feel that the head and the body are two different things. In fact, they cannot be separated from each other.</p><p>Submission in the body is spontaneous and natural. Many movements of the body have their origin in the subconscious or unconscious part of the psyche. One can differentiate between conscious and subconscious activities in a textbook, but in actual life, the difference is not that apparent. One does not make deliberate distinctions between conscious and subconscious motions. When a part of the body is under duress, such as when an arm is wounded, a person becomes very conscious of that member, especially when he tries to move it. If I ask whether or not you breathed yesterday, you will not have any conscious memory of breathing, but you were breathing. If you are sick with tuberculosis, you will think about your breathing and be conscious of it all the time. When you are healthy, you do not give the slightest thought to such functions, but even though you are unaware of the movement of the body, the head directs it unceasingly. The oneness and harmony between the head and the body are beyond human description. In the body God's authority can be fully illustrated. The submission of the body to the head is the most perfect example of submission to authority. The Lord requires a submission from us that matches that of the body to the head. May the Lord lead us to see the Body of Christ and to realize that this is where God's authority is manifested. No member should be sick; none should murmur, complain, rebel, or be discordant. God desires that we express His authority. If we stand fast, God will have a way to go on. We hope that we will manifest God's authority in this way. If any friction arises among us, it proves that we are short of the manifestation of divine authority. The Body of Christ is not only the place where brothers and sisters fellowship and love one another; it is the place where God's authority is expressed. The relationship among us should be one of spontaneity and harmony; we are not compelled to be together. We are an institution that expresses God's authority, and submission among us should be very spontaneous.</p><h2 class="head1">INDIRECT MANIFESTATION OF AUTHORITY</h2><p>Authority is not only expressed directly in the body, but indirectly as well. For example, the hand helps the foot. To the foot, the hand appears to be helping, but in reality, the whole body is helping it. The head directs the hand to help the foot. Many people realize that there is a oneness of life among the members, but they do not see that there is also a oneness of authority among the members. The church is not only an institution of life but also an institution of authority. If the foot rejects the hand, it rejects the head. The hand does not move by itself; it moves by the authority of the head. Therefore, when the hand helps the foot and the foot rejects it, the foot is rejecting the head. When the foot has a need, the hand is not the only member that helps it; all the members of the body join in to help. Therefore, we have to acknowledge the authority in the members. Acknowledging the authority in the members is acknowledging the authority of the head.</p><p>It is impossible to deny the authority of the members without denying the authority of the Head at the same time. It is impossible to reject deputy authority without rejecting the authority of the Head at the same time. Deputy authority is God's ordination for the Body. In Shanghai I once said that every member of the Body is an authority to us. As a member we only possess our own function. If I am a hand in the Body of Christ, my function is limited to that of the hand. If I want to walk, I have to depend on the feet. Although the hand possesses a great variety of functions, it has to look to the feet for walking. If the hand wants to walk by itself, it puts a very hard task upon itself. If the feet refuse to walk, the hand can do nothing. It is likewise impossible for the hand to know color by touching it. It can try for a lifetime, but it will never distinguish different colors. Once the eyes see, they identify color. The hand cannot see anything by itself; therefore, it needs the judgment of the eyes. The functioning of the eyes becomes the authority to the hand. If God has appointed a certain person to be the eye, everyone has to go to him for seeing. The same can be said of the functions of the nose and the ears. The function of every member in the Body becomes its authority. If any member tries to replace another member, the result will be trouble. The problem today is that everyone acts as if he is a whole body in himself; everyone thinks that he is omnipotent and can do everything. This is impossible. We are not the Body of Christ; we are only a little member. We have to accept the functions of the other members. If we all stand on the ground of a member, we will become useful. Some are mouths, and they can speak. Others are eyes, and they can see. Some are ears, and they can hear. Others are noses, and they can smell. Still others are hands, and they can work. We all have to maintain our standing, receive other members, and coordinate together. We may not see something ourselves, but others have seen it; they are our eyes. Their seeing is our seeing. We may not have heard something ourselves, but others have heard it; they are our ears. Their hearing becomes our hearing. What the mouths have spoken, we have spoken. If we can see this, we will rejoice, and we will be able to submit and receive.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE MEMBERS BEING<br />THE AUTHORITY OF THE MEMBERS</h2><p>In the Body, life and authority are one. This is a most harmonious union. Where the oneness of the Body is, there the authority of the Body is. The function possessed by a member of the Body becomes his authority. There are many things which we do not have to experience ourselves; we only need to submit to those who have experienced them. If I am a hand, I should realize that I am not made to see. Therefore, I have to acknowledge the function of the eyes. If I am a foot, I should realize that I am not made to hear; I have to accept the function of the ears. The problem today is that some want to take the place of the eyes even though they are hands. Others want to take over the function of the ears even though they are legs. Two years ago five brothers were studying a certain portion of the Scripture in my living room. One was an ear, but he wanted to express something. Another was a nose, yet he also wanted to say a few words. It was like the five fingers of the hand conducting a conference among themselves to discuss the color of a pair of eyeglasses. In the end there were five conclusions, and all of them were wrong. We are the Body of Christ, and we can only see through the eyes that God has ordained. If we are not the eyes, we should not insist on seeing everything ourselves. The so-called "seeing" of many people is actually the "touching" of their hands. Day after day God's children are touching colors with their hands. It is no wonder that so many heresies have been produced during the past two thousand years. They all came about when men considered the touching of their hands to be the seeing of their eyes. One portion of the Scripture might not have a definitive judgment if three or five brothers studied it for twenty years. But another brother may be able to give a judgment immediately. If we are a leg, it is wrong for us to do the things that belong to the hand. If we are willing to accept the other members, we will receive the riches of the entire Body. It is easy for the eyes to identify black and white. The hand only needs to accept and submit, and it will receive what the eyes see. If a man is willing to submit to the authority of all the members, he will receive the riches of all the members. God's children are poor because they have not submitted to authority. Christians today want to see everything for themselves. But one cannot do everything by himself. If all the members in the church together possess the riches of the entire Christ, the fullness of the Body of Christ as mentioned in Ephesians will be easily realized. When the eyes are single, the whole body is bright. The eyes can take care of the scenery; there is no need for the ears to try to see. They only need to accept the seeing of the eyes and enjoy this seeing. The ears listen to music, and neither the hands nor the eyes have to listen, yet both share the same enjoyment.</p><p>A member cannot say, "I will only submit to the Head; I will not submit to the other members." Just as a man should not rebel and oppose the Head presumptuously, he should not oppose the members. No one dares challenge the Lord's authority. So if all the members are obedient to the Lord's authority, they should be all the more obedient to the authority of the members with whom they are coordinated. If a member insists on seeing everything himself, he is in rebellion. If one member refuses to receive supply from another member, he is rebelling against the latter because he does not yield to the Lord's coordination. Our body is not like the central switchboard of a telephone system, where every terminal is directly related to just the switchboard. The Lord's authority is manifested in two areas in the Body. In the first the Lord speaks to a member directly. In the second He uses one member to supply another member. In both cases there is the exercise of authority. When the eyes see, they see under the direct supervision of the Head. For the eyes to see is for the whole Body to see. All the members of the Body should submit to the seeing of the eyes. As far as the eyes are concerned, they are supplying. As far as the other members are concerned, they are subjecting themselves to the authority of the Head. What the eyes see, the whole Body sees. This is indirect authority, or deputy authority. Remember, however, that deputy authority is the same as the authority of the Head. It is rebellion for a person to rebel against the Head directly. It is also rebellion for a person to reject the supply of the members or the deputized authority. Once we submit to visible authority, there will be no barrier between us and the Head. When we submit to the other members, we remove all barriers that exist between us and the Head; we become one with the Head. Therefore, the supply a member renders is the authority he possesses. All other members have to submit to him and receive from him.</p><h2 class="head1">MINISTRY BEING AUTHORITY ITSELF</h2><p>First Corinthians 12 speaks of operations, gifts, and various ministries. Whoever has the gift has the ministry, and whoever has the ministry has the authority. For example, the eyes see. The seeing is the gift. The eyes have the gift of seeing, which means that they have the ministry of seeing. This also means that they have the authority of the ministry. The commission that one receives is the authority he inherits. When a man is commissioned to a work, he receives a ministry as far as he is concerned. But as far as others are concerned, he has become their authority. A man may be commissioned to manage a house; to him this is a ministry, but to others his ministry has become his authority. Anyone who enters the house has to obey him. Those who are commissioned have the authority. Those who have the ministry have the authority, and others have no choice but to obey them. The ministry with which God commissions a person becomes his authority, and it is right for others to acknowledge this authority. Today many people only see the relationship they have with the Head; they have not seen the relationship they have with other members; they have not seen how they should receive from one another. If you are a cell, you are directly related to the Head, but at the same time, there are other cells all around you; there is a relationship between you and them. Everyone likes to come under the direct authority of God, but God has arranged indirect authorities for us to practice our submission. Authority comes from many directions in the Body. If the brothers and sisters practice submission when they encounter ministry, there will be oneness and coordination.</p><h2 class="head1">A SUBMISSIVE LIFE</h2><p>It is very hard for God to make the world, the creatures in the universe, or the Israelites obey, because they do not have a life relationship with God. But it is easy for us to submit because we are related to God in life. Submission is God's nature; it is the very nature that God has given us. To us, it is a hard thing not to obey, because we are one in life. This is the same as saying that it is natural and spontaneous for the hands and legs to be harmonious with one another because they are one in life. It is hard for the hands and feet to fight each other. Receiving others' ministry is an easy thing. Conflict in the human body arises only when the body is sick. When the body is healthy, all the members are one. Schism in the body occurs only with schizophrenics. We feel right and comfortable when we submit because we are one Body in the Lord. Why do we not allow the Body of Christ to live a life of joy? Why must God's children fight and bicker with one another? Why must we criticize and destroy each other? This is against the very nature of our life. It is a matter of joy and rest for Christians to obey one another and to submit to one another.</p><h2 class="head1">ACKNOWLEDGING ONE'S LIMITATIONS<br />AND RECEIVING SUPPLY FROM THE BODY</h2><p>If we are submissive, we will not need to bear many burdens; the whole Body will bear these burdens for us. This will result in joy for the whole Body. Once we have tasted this experience, we will realize that we have never enjoyed something like this before in our whole life. It is a tiresome thing to bear all of our burdens alone. Perhaps we have not tired ourselves out yet. This is the reason we are still bearing our burdens. Many people have been bearing such burdens for years. They should have tired of them. Many people do everything by themselves. It is a tedious task for a member to bear the work of the entire Body. We have been working and bearing our own anxieties for years. Many burdens can be shared with others, and many works can be done by others. If we share our many burdens and works with the other members, it will become a light and easy thing for us to go on. We will thank God, saying, "Brother So-and-so can speak this, and Brother So-and-so can see that." As soon as a person accepts his limitations, he enters into rest. If a person who is an eye tries to be the leg, he will probably end up having insomnia. If he is an eye, he should give himself to only be an eye; let the legs run. Submission to the authority of the Body and mutual yielding of the members is a big release. To put it another way, it is a great burden for a person to try to do what he cannot do. We must all learn to accept our limitations. If we do, the Lord will put the greatest rest and joy before us. Otherwise, we will run over others and overtax ourselves when we try to usurp the place of others and do what we cannot do.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING OBEDIENCE IN THE BODY</h2><p>We have to see that it is difficult to practice obedience in the world or in the universe, but it is spontaneous to submit to authority in the Body. It is hard not to submit in the Body. In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul shows us the Body ministry. Today some people are fighting for a ministry. This is foolish. If we are in the Body, everything becomes one. Since the time of creation God has been manifesting His authority. Today is the age of the church; we are in the fourth stage. Only in the church, that is, in the Body of Christ, do we find a perfect relationship between submission and authority. It is hard to ask children to submit to their parents, wives to submit to their husbands, or servants to submit to their masters in the world. It is hard to find a person who happily pays taxes to a customs officer. However, the Lord is asking us to learn obedience in the church, the Body of Christ. The first place to learn submission is not in the family or the world. Unless we learn obedience in the church, we will not obey in the family or obey the government, because we will not have the proper foundation of obedience in us. There are many members in the Body of Christ, and there are many opportunities to learn obedience. If we learn the proper lessons in the Body, we will do well in every other relationship. I have seen many brothers and sisters who obey their parents only because they have learned obedience in the church. First we learn obedience from the Lord and the church, and then we will have proper relationships with others. The church is the test of our obedience to Christ. Unless a man learns these lessons in the church and tears down his individualism there, he will not know how to behave himself anywhere. The church is the testing ground; it is also the perfecting ground. If we do not learn our lessons here, we will fail in everything else we do. If we learn our lessons well in the church, the problem of the kingdom, of the world, and even of the entire universe will be settled.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY AND SUBMISSION BEING<br />PERFECTLY JOINED AS ONE IN THE BODY</h2><p>God's work is in the church. Everything depends on us today. God is recovering His system of authority; His authority must be recovered in the church. He does not wish to see even the slightest trace of rebellion in the church. The way to go on today is to live the Body life, where authority is complemented by mutual love and coordination. Once this problem is settled, all other problems are settled. In the past the truth of authority and submission was objective and impersonal. Authority was objective, and so was submission. Authority was impersonal, and so was submission. We submitted to outward things in an outward way. Today authority and submission have to become organic; they have to become inward and subjective. In the Body of Christ, that is, in the church, authority and submission meet in the same place. The two become a subjective and living whole. Authority and submission become one living entity, a oneness in life. This is the highest form of divine authority. No other oneness can be compared with the oneness of the Head with the Body. The Head and the Body are fully one; there is no possibility of separation. Previously, authority was one thing and submission another. Today in the Body of Christ there is no separation between them; they have become inseparably one.</p><p>The Body is the place where God's authority is manifested. It is also the place where submission is practiced. This is the place where one touches God's authority. This is the church, the Body of Christ. This is also the ultimate expression of God's authority. Authority and submission reach their peak in the Body. Therefore, the Body of Christ is the peak! If we cannot learn submission in the church, we will not learn it anywhere else. If we do not take this way, we will have no way to go on. If God cannot get through in this matter, He cannot get through in other matters. May we learn our lesson here. Without this, we do not have a way to go on. The one place where we will touch authority on earth is the Body of Christ. If we learn this lesson well, we will get through in everything. We have to learn to touch God's authority, not man's authority. The Head is in the church and so are all the members. If we do not touch authority here, we will not touch it anywhere. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S DESIRE FOR MAN TO SUBMIT<br />TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 26, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><h2 class="head1">REBELLION<br />BEING THE GREATEST SIN</h2><p>Today we will continue with the subject of God's authority in the Old Testament. Numbers 16 records two instances of rebellion. We have seen the first rebellion, which covers verses 1 through 40. This was the rebellion of the leaders among God's people. Their end was the way of Sheol; they went straight down to hell. God's people should overcome the gates of Hades, but these ones were overcome by the gates of Hades instead. From verse 41 to the end of the chapter is the second rebellion. This was the rebellion of the entire congregation of Israel. In verse 41 the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of Jehovah." The spirit of rebellion is infectious. Even when a person witnesses judgment on others, he may not stop the rebellion in himself. The people did not take warning from the result of the rebellion of the two hundred fifty leaders. On the contrary, when the rebellious ones were judged and sent to Hades, the whole congregation rose up in rebellion. They forgot that the gates of Hades opened up the first time because of the leaders' own folly. They forgot that it was not Moses and Aaron who had judged the two hundred fifty leaders, but God who had judged them. Moses and Aaron did not open the gates of Hades; God opened them. The congregation only saw men; they did not realize that authority comes from God, and they attacked boldly. As the entire congregation was attacking Moses and Aaron, God stepped forward and vindicated Himself. He showed that authority comes from Him alone. In reality, the people were not opposing Moses and Aaron; they were opposing God. Moses and Aaron saw the rebellion of the congregation, but they did not open their mouths to argue with them. Instead, God spoke. His glory was manifested in the tabernacle. His glory manifested itself not only in times of deliverance, but in times of judgment as well. God told Moses and Aaron that He would destroy the entire congregation. As soon as a man begins to rebel, he moves his feet towards the gates of Hades.</p><p>Before Moses and Aaron spoke, God stepped in to deal with the people. God's glory was manifested in the execution of His judgment. God could tolerate the ten murmurings of the people in the wilderness. He could tolerate their sin of reminiscing about Egypt or their lack of interest in entering Canaan. These sins prevented them from entering Canaan directly through Kadesh-barnea and caused them to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years. However, He could not tolerate their touching His authority. He would not tolerate them for another thirty-eight years but would destroy them in an instant. The sin of rebellion is more serious than any other kind of sin. The Israelites were already at the threshold of Canaan. If God would not let them go in, it would defeat the purpose of their exodus out of Egypt. Yet God was willing to let the entire generation go. He could bear many sins and forgive many trespasses, but rebellion is the pathway to hell; it is in the principle of death and Satan. This sin is more serious than any other sin. As the people were opposing God's authority, God spoke to Moses and Aaron, and after He spoke, a plague broke out. Within a few minutes 14,700 persons died. What a sobering thing! Fortunately, Moses had keen spiritual discernment; he ordered Aaron to take the censer, put fire in it from off the altar, place incense on it, and carry it to the assembly to make propitiation for them. This stopped the plague. This shows us how serious it is to stand against authority!</p><h2 class="head1">SAUL'S STUMBLING IN THE MATTER OF AUTHORITY</h2><p>After the children of Israel entered Canaan, they fell into confusion time after time during the period of the judges. Everyone did according to what was right in his own sight. God was not able to set up His authority among the people. God's authority was not found among them until the kingdom of Israel was established and the period of the kings began. When the Israelites came out of Egypt, the entire race experienced deliverance. By the time of the kings, the authority of the kingdom was established. Saul was the first king of the kingdom of Israel. God chose him and made him the authority, that is, God's deputy authority. Later, Saul fell in the matter of authority. God commanded him to destroy the Amalekites and everything they possessed, but Saul disobeyed God's command and had pity on Agag the king of Amalek. He was not willing to destroy the best of the sheep and the oxen of the Amalekites. He did not hearken to God's word. Therefore, Samuel said to him, "Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices/As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?/Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams" (1 Sam. 15:22). He told Saul that God wanted obedience and submission from him, not the best of the sheep, oxen, and sacrifices. Saul was God's appointed authority, yet he did not keep his place as an authority. Saul was the greatest utilitarian in the Old Testament, and Judas was his counterpart in the New Testament. Saul was the Old Testament pragmatist, and Judas was the New Testament pragmatist. Saul was a little better than Judas; he spared things for the Lord, while Judas tried to save the money spent on the ointment for the poor. Yet the principle of rebellion in both cases is the same.</p><h2 class="head1">DAVID HONORING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h2><p>After Saul disobeyed God, he was put aside. Although Saul was still on the throne, in God's eyes he was over. God's intention was for David to be the king. Out of jealousy, Saul tried very hard to kill David, but David was unwilling to kill Saul in return. Both were anointed by the divine ointment. However, Saul was acting under God's past will, while David was acting under God's present plan and will. Both were kings. David was under God's anointing as well as God's plan. God intended for David to be king, and He also anointed David as king. It was wrong for Saul to oppose David. How could anyone oppose David as king? In man's eyes there was nothing wrong with David moving his hand a little to put himself on the throne. This was in line with God's will, and God had set Saul aside already. In God's eyes Saul's kingship was over. Was it not justifiable for David to help God to remove Saul? Was it not justifiable for him to assume the kingship sooner and to accomplish God's plan? God's will was for David to be the king. Was it not right for him to assume the kingship according to God's will? According to man there is nothing wrong with this, but this was not the way David reasoned. In 1 Samuel 24, while Saul was chasing David in the wilderness of Engedi, Saul entered a cave to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding in the inner part of the cave. The two enemies crossed paths. It would have been easy for David to kill Saul then. He could have thought, "God committed Goliath to my hand at one time. Now He has put Saul in my hand. What is wrong for me to kill him like I killed Goliath?" Had David killed Saul, he would have hastened God's plan in a sense, but by so doing, he would have rebelled against God's authority. Although Saul had failed, he still was the king and God's anointed authority. Although he had failed, David was still under his authority at one time. David's killing of Saul would have gained him his kingship at the expense of rebellion. This would have put him under a standing of rebellion. The proper way was for David to submit to God's authority rather than to His plan. Rebellion had disqualified Saul, and it could have disqualified David as well. Killing Saul would have put him in a wrong position. He was willing to take the right position and risk the danger of being killed by Saul rather than to rebel against God's deputy authority.</p><p>David's relationship with Saul was the same as Michael's relationship with Satan. David dealt with Saul in the same principle that Michael dealt with Satan. David only said, "May Jehovah judge between me and you" (1 Sam. 24:12). He was truly a person who knew divine authority. He was unlike many men today who behave lawlessly and recklessly in the church, in their family, and in society. If these men were in David's place, ninety-nine and a half out of a hundred would have killed Saul. We must uphold God's principle of authority more than our own existence. May the Lord grant us a little light to see the seriousness of God's authority. His authority is a tremendous thing. God will forever honor His own authority. We have to realize how sensitive and delicate the matter of authority is. It should not be lightly touched. This is the very principle governing the entire universe. A person cannot say that he only needs to submit to God's direct authority. He must first submit to God's appointed deputy authority. I wish that heaven would open and light would come to you to show you what God's authority means. If God has the intention for you to be the king, let Him move His hand and let Him put you on the throne! You must realize how sensitive God's authority is. You must realize this before you can be a man of light before Him. Once authority is overturned, everything is finished. You may think that there is nothing wrong in your enthusiasm for soul-winning and your zeal for work, but have you touched God's authority? Saul could have had many reasons for acting as he did. He could have reasoned, "Agag is not bad. Many of the people of Israel are short of meat, and the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites are so excellent. What a waste it would be to kill them all!" He was insensitive to the seriousness of the act of rebellion against authority. This is where he differed from David. David was very sensitive to authority; he upheld authority to the point of almost losing his own life. Saul, however, had his own thoughts. His heart was on the sheep and oxen, and he wanted to offer them as sacrifices to God. Instead, he sacrificed God's command.</p><p>The next incident is recorded in 1 Samuel 26. Saul and his captains with their choice men sought David in the wilderness of Ziph. There they camped and slept. Another temptation was presented before David here. He easily could have killed Saul, for "a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them" (v. 12). An ignorant Christian would sing "hallelujah" at such a juncture. He would think that the opportunity to remove Saul had come his way again. But David only took away Saul's spear and water jug; he let Saul go. Unless a man has received a great light from the Lord, he can easily reason within himself, "I let him go the first time; that should have justified my innocence. I was more than fair in letting him go the first time. Now this time I can surely kill him. Saul is still coming after me. Now I can kill him." David, however, was under a strong light. He dared not rebel against God's deputy authority. He always upheld God's authority. An authority is always an authority. Our submission to authority must not be affected by our environment. This is the only way that we can assume deputy authority ourselves.</p><h2 class="head1">DAVID'S ABSOLUTE UPHOLDING OF GOD'S AUTHORITY</h2><p>Let me quote a third incident. This will show you more clearly the matter of submission to authority. After 1 Samuel, we come to chapter one of 2 Samuel, which details David's reaction to Saul's suicide. In man's eyes, it was good news for David that Saul had died. Second Samuel 1 tells us that a young man came and reported to David how he had killed Saul, based on Saul's plea as he approached his death (vv. 6-10). The young man thought that he would surely receive a reward from David. Instead, David responded, "How is it that you were not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?" (v. 14). He then ordered the young messenger to be killed because he had said with his own mouth that he had killed Jehovah's anointed. This shows us that not only did David himself refrain from rebellion and tearing down God's deputy authority, but he forbade others from doing the same. Here we find the extent to which David upheld God's authority. It is wonderful to see David's maintaining of such a relationship with God's authority; he was not careless in any way. This is the reason God loved David and established an everlasting kingdom for him. God said that David was "a man after His heart" (1 Sam. 13:14). God allowed his kingdom to continue. Even our Lord was a descendant of David according to the flesh (Rom. 1:3). In order for us to be a king, we must first submit to the King. In order for us to be an authority, we must first submit to authority. In order for us to be anointed, we must first humble ourselves before the Anointed One. God allows only those who submit to the King to be the kings. He only allows those who submit to authority to be the authority. This is a serious matter. We have to eradicate the root of rebellion in us. If we want to be an authority, we must first submit to authority. An authority must never be rash in action or words; he must never act impulsively. Today many workers and conference speakers are satisfied with their good works and fruits. But often I have thought of asking them, "You are boasting about so many things that you have done, but how many times have you submitted in your life? Do you know what submission means?" I am afraid that some people have never learned to submit to anyone in their whole life; they have never submitted to anyone's authority. Today those who want to be an authority must first learn to submit to authority.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION BEING THE UNIQUE CRUCIAL MATTER</h2><p>In order to deal with the brothers and sisters and bring them into submission, we ourselves must first eradicate the spirit of rebellion and the thoughts of rebellion within us. We are not here merely to earn a living or to play games. These are sober days! The most basic issue is the matter of authority. If we do not settle this issue, it is useless for us to talk about other things. If we do not know authority, we will not have a way to go on in our work, our service, or even our personal walk as a Christian. We must remember that the kind of person we are determines the kind of persons we raise up. We must submit to authority. This is the unique crucial matter. If we do not settle this matter in a fundamental way, we cannot go on. The church is the institution of submission. My heart is not on the power or weakness of the brothers and sisters. I am not afraid of foolishness or lowliness in men. The only thing that I am afraid of is rebellion. A nation's first concern is not the poverty or weakness of its citizens but whether or not there is division and rebellion. Once there is division and rebellion, the nation perishes. In the same way, when division arises in a family, it is finished. Where authority is absent, confusion reigns, and no building can be realized. It is a solemn thing that we are gathered together here. I hope that we will all see the seriousness of the matter of authority. God's deputy authority can be found in our government, our society, our family, and the church. We have to learn to submit to deputy authority before we can assume deputy authority.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD ENTRUSTING HIMSELF<br />TO THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h2><p>Some may ask, "What happens if the deputy authority makes a mistake? Should we still submit to him?" We have to see that God has entrusted Himself to the deputy authority. I must shout loudly that God's deputy authority is God's revealed authority. God's deputy authority is in fact God's very authority. God charges children to submit to their parents, wives to submit to their husbands, employees to submit to their superiors, and citizens to submit to those in authority. Some wonder if these deputy authorities are worthy of submission. They wonder how God could ever have entrusted Himself to such husbands or officers. Brothers and sisters, do you think that God does not know that among government officials, half of them are avaricious? Do you think that God is ignorant to the mistakes of those in authority? We are so worried that those in authority may make mistakes, but we must realize that God's greatness lies in the very fact that He is able to entrust His authority to man. Man is afraid of entrusting authority to other men. Since God wants man to submit to deputy authority, we can see the great responsibility that a deputy authority bears. It is not an easy thing for God to entrust His authority to man. However, since God is not afraid to hand His authority to man, it means that He can put His trust in the deputy authority. We have to realize that even though it is difficult to submit to deputy authority, it is even more difficult for God to appoint deputy authority. It is not a light matter for God to entrust Himself to His deputy authority.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING AT PEACE TO SUBMIT TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h2><p>Since God dares to commit Himself to the deputy authority, we should dare to submit ourselves to the same. God puts His trust in all the masters, parents, husbands, and men in position. He does not say that we should submit only to the half that are good. If that is the case, we may choose to take the other half, to whom we think we owe no submission. Since God was at peace to use a man such as Saul, David was at peace to submit to him. Saul's behavior before God was God's business; David's attitude was simply one of submission. Whether or not Moses and Aaron were wrong in how they behaved is not for me to know; all I need to know is that they were God's deputy authority. All the Israelites needed to know was that Moses and Aaron were deputy authorities. That should have been enough for them to practice submission. When the Israelites had a complaint, they did not argue with God; they did not say that God was wrong. Rather, they said that Moses and Aaron were wrong. When the Israelites rebelled against Moses and Aaron, however, God said that they were rebelling against Him. Where authority is present, God upholds this authority. Where authority is absent, God appoints authority. First God appoints authority, and then He upholds authority. Whether or not a deputy authority is wrong is nobody else's business, but if I am wrong in my attitude, I have to bear the responsibility. We have to learn to have the courage to submit to deputy authority. God never argues with us about the rights and wrongs of the deputy authority. He only charges us to take care of ourselves. God took care of Saul's right and wrong. We have to be responsible for how we behave. If God did not have trust in such a man, He would not have appointed him in the first place. It is a serious thing for God to entrust Himself to man unconditionally. Many people entrust themselves to others conditionally. For example, a man may entrust another person with his money. He may say that the other person can use his money as long as the amount is under a hundred dollars. But if the amount is exceeded by one dollar, he should check before spending it. This is a conditional trust, but God entrusts His authority to man absolutely.</p><p>It is a great thing to entrust someone with authority. We have to believe that God has entrusted Himself to His deputy authority. He will surely honor the authority He has appointed. According to our rebellious nature, we are happy only to submit to God's direct authority; we have no respect for His appointed deputy authority. Many people think that they can submit as long as they can set aside God's deputy authority. Yet ninety percent of all authorities are deputy authorities. If God has no qualm about entrusting Himself to these deputy authorities, we should have no qualm in submitting to them. Since the Lord is happy to commission men to be His authority, we should be happy to submit to these commissioned authorities.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD HONORING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h2><p>Let us consider again the ordinance regarding the taking of a vow in Numbers 30 and see how God honors deputy authority. In the entire chapter, only verse 2 speaks about man. From verse 3 onward, the subject is the vow of the woman. The woman is under authority. Before she is married, she is her father's daughter. After she is married, she is her husband's wife. Prior to her marriage, her father is her authority. After she is married, her husband is her authority. No man or woman can revoke his or her vow before the Lord; a person must carry out his or her vow. This is God's direct commandment; it relates to God's direct authority. The woman has an added consideration; she is under an indirect authority&mdash;her father or her husband. The father or husband is a woman's deputy authority. This is an authority appointed by God. When a girl makes a vow at home before she is married, this vow has to be approved by her father before God will recognize it. It seems as if God is saying that in order for a woman to submit to God's authority, she must first submit to His deputy authority. If the father objects to the vow, God will not acknowledge it. If He acknowledged it, He would be overturning His own authority. God honors His own deputy authority, which He appointed Himself. If the deputy authority approves it, the direct Authority endorses it. If the deputy authority does not approve it, the direct Authority will not endorse it. The whole chapter is on this one matter. After a woman is married, she is under the authority of her husband. As long as her husband does not approve a vow, God will not hold the wife accountable for it. God only requires that the wife submit to the deputy authority. In the New Testament a man cannot say that he has made a gift to God of what is due to his parents and, therefore, has no further obligation to honor his parents (Matt. 15:5-6). God says that we should honor our father and mother (v. 4). A man cannot overturn God's deputy authority; he cannot make an excuse by saying that he is submitting to God's direct authority. God says that if a person does not submit to deputy authority, his vows will not be honored by Him. In the same way, after a woman is married, the vow she makes in the presence of and with the consent of her husband is acknowledged. If the husband does not consent to it, God will annul the vow. If the husband dies and the woman remarries, the same submission applies to the second husband; he is the deputy authority, inasmuch as God is the authority. Here we find God establishing His deputy authority.</p><p>What should we do when the deputy authority makes a mistake? Numbers 30:15 says that if a husband makes null and void the vows and pledges of his wife after he has heard them, he will have to bear her iniquity. If a deputy authority makes a mistake, we do not have to bear any responsibility for his mistake; he has to bear the responsibility of the iniquity himself. God only requires obedience from the wife. In this chapter of Scripture, God shows us that He will not allow a person to overstep His appointed deputy authority even if it is under the pretense of obeying God directly. We cannot say that since we have received a command from God, we will obey God only and do not need to take heed to the command of the elders or the apostles. If the husband is wrong, he must bear not only his own sin but the sin of his wife as well. Therefore, we have to learn to be a deputy authority ourselves. A deputy authority has to learn to obey God. If we are wrong, we must bear not only our own sin but the sin of misguiding others. The entire New Testament upholds the place of deputy authority. In the Gospels we find Christ exercising submission when He answered the high priest who questioned Him in the name of God. In Acts we find Paul doing the same thing when he faced Ananias the high priest.</p><p>The only portion in the New Testament where we find an exception to this rule is when Peter testified concerning the resurrected Christ and the Sanhedrin tried to stop him from preaching in the name of the Lord. Peter and the other apostles answered, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29). The authority of the Sanhedrin was also a deputy authority, and it was right for the Jews to obey it. But in this case, the Sanhedrin was clearly acting contrary to God's authority by rejecting the Lord's name and forbidding the apostles from preaching the Lord. The apostles could not go along with this. Only under such circumstances were they allowed to say, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." Other than this, a person should not rebel against God's deputy authority under any circumstance. We cannot be careless in this matter. We cannot practice rebellion under the pretense of obeying God. We cannot rebel against the deputy authority while claiming that we are obeying God. What a solemn matter deputy authority is! God's authority is established successively step by step through submission in each step. We cannot disobey our parents while claiming that we are obeying God. When a person rebels against deputy authority, he is rebelling against God's authority. We have to learn to identify God's deputy authorities, and we have to learn to honor them, uphold them, and build them up. We must obey deputy authority, and we must eradicate the spirit of rebellion in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE NAME OF JESUS<br />AND HOW IT IS RELATED TO AUTHORITY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Monday, June 28, 1948<br />Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1, 17-19</h1><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY OVER POWER</h2><p>Today we will speak about the relationship between the name of Jesus and authority. How much does the name of Jesus include! How little do we know about it! Luke 24:47 says that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name. This means that forgiveness comes from the name of Jesus. It is also through this name that the disciples received life, cast out demons, caused men to walk, and baptized men. It is also through this name that believers are justified, that they pray to God, and that God pours out the Holy Spirit. The emphasis here is that the Bible equates the name of Jesus with authority. Luke 10 speaks of the seventy disciples going out to preach. In verse 17 they returned and reported to the Lord, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name." In verse 19 the Lord answered them, saying, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you." The name in verse 17 equals the authority in verse 19. The Lord's name is His authority. The serpents are related to Satan, and the scorpions are related to his power.</p><p>There is a big difference between authority and power. Twenty years ago we saw the difference between authority and power. In Shanghai I once said that the power spoken of in the New Testament is like dynamite; it is not an ordinary kind of power but a tremendous power. Yet authority transcends such a power. Authority can subdue the greatest and strongest power. Authority prevails over power; it subdues even the power of dynamite. The Lord said that He has given us authority to overcome the power of Satan.</p><p>Everywhere in this world, we find authority prevailing over power. An elderly man of seventy years old may not be able to walk. He may cough all the time, his back may be hunched, and he may carry a stick with him everywhere. His thirty-year-old son may be very strong physically, but the son has to obey the words of the father. As far as power is concerned, the son is stronger than the father, yet he has to obey the father. The son obeys the father not because of his power but because of his authority. Consider the example of a school. A teacher may have a few dozen or even a hundred students in a class. All the students obey the teacher. As far as their power is concerned, the students' combined power is surely much greater than that of the teacher. Yet they obey the teacher. When the teacher assigns the students work, they obey. When the teacher prepares an examination, the students take the exam. The students obey the teacher not on account of his power but on account of his authority. As far as power is concerned, ten strong teachers would still be unable to subdue a class of over a hundred students. The issue, however, is not power but authority. The teacher has the authority to rule over the students. This is an example of authority over power.</p><p>God's priority in the whole universe is authority. Satan controls man with his power. He instills fear in man with his power. Yet he does not have any authority. Let me give another illustration which I used twenty years ago when I was speaking in Shanghai. There is a busy intersection in the city of Shanghai. Many cars go through it every minute. During its busiest hours over a hundred cars can pass through it at any one moment. However, only one policeman directs traffic. One person controls over a hundred cars at any one moment. As far as power is concerned, a hundred-horsepower car is strong enough to pulverize the policeman, but all the cars at the intersection only move according to the waving of the policeman's arm. His club is neither short nor long; it is no good as a weapon for beating either men or dogs. It is useless even for kneading flour dough, but that little club is very useful for directing hundreds of cars. This is another example of authority over power.</p><p>As soon as the Lord's disciples exercised authority, Satan fell like lightning out of heaven. It is true that he possesses power in this world, but he does not have any authority. He merely exercises his power through messengers who follow him. God, however, has appointed us to be His authority to subdue Satan. No matter how powerful Satan is, authority is in our hand. As long as we have authority, everything is under us. This universe is ruled by authority. God has established authority as the fundamental principle of administration. As soon as a man touches authority, his own power disintegrates. A robber may be armed with a gun, but as soon as he meets a policeman, his boldness leaves him. The policeman does not have to run away; the robber is the one who has to run. Authority is behind the whole issue. When a sergeant gives a command, the soldiers march, and when he halts, the soldiers stop. What gives the sergeant the ground to direct his soldiers? The soldiers have weapons. Why do they have to listen to one man? Here we find authority prevailing over power. If a man knows authority, he will spontaneously obey. No one can go up against authority with his power. Authority will eventually prevail over power. In the spiritual realm we are the ones with representative authority. Although Satan has power, the victory will always be ours, because authority always prevails over power.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NAME OF JESUS SIGNIFYING AUTHORITY</h2><p>We have to realize that all our authority is identified with the name of Jesus. Authority is embodied in the name of Jesus. When the seventy disciples went out in the name of the Lord, they were able to cast out demons; the demons had to obey them. Some of the disciples might have been quite crude and uneducated, but when they cast out the demons in that name, it was very effective. This is because, in the Lord's own words, authority had been given to them. As soon as we speak the name of Jesus, the devil trembles. We have to see that authority is in the name. Philippians 2:10 says that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, because God has given the Lord the highest authority. The supreme name of Jesus represents His supreme authority. Jesus was exalted through His infinite, absolute, perfect, unquestionable, and immeasurable obedience. In man's eyes He was humbled to the lowest point. In God's eyes, however, "he who humbles himself shall be exalted" (Luke 18:14). The Lord Jesus was submissive to the end, when He met His death at the cross. His death on the cross epitomizes His submission. Through this submission He received all the authority.</p><p>Before He went to the cross, the Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" (Matt. 26:39). The cup refers to the crucifixion. The Lord did not drink the cup just because it came His way while He was on earth. He drank the cup only when He identified it with God's will. The Lord did not pray, "If it is possible, let Your will pass from Me." Rather, He prayed, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me." He was not afraid of the cup. His concern was whether or not the cup was God's will. The Lord did not come for the cross, but for the carrying out of God's will. He would gladly go to the cross if this was God's will. If it was not God's will, He would not bind Himself to the cross. Hence, to Him the cross was not merely a symbol of suffering, but a symbol of submission to God's will. By itself suffering deserves no merit. It deserves merit only when it coincides with God's will. Therefore, the Lord's crucifixion is the highest expression of His submission. After He expressed submission through the cross, God raised Him up to the highest point, even to the throne. On earth the Lord was a representative of submission. On the throne He is a representative of authority. This is the reason He was able to say to the disciples after His resurrection, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations" (Matt. 28:18-19). He is now on the throne. On the cross He was the epitome of humility. On the throne He is the exemplar of supreme exaltation. He has received all authority on the throne, and this authority is now carried by His name. The Lord received this name because He had perfected absolute submission.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE LORD'S NAME</h2><p>Before the Lord's resurrection, authority was in God's hand. After the Lord was crucified, resurrected, and exalted, God gave all authority to Him. On one side we see total submission. On the other side we see the highest authority. When the Lord was exalted, God gave Him the name of Jesus. Yet the Lord has passed on this name to us. Today every aspect of our work is carried out in this name. In this name we preach the gospel, gather to meet, and teach and receive one another. If we do not know this name, how can we work for the Lord? If we do not know submission, we will never know God's authority. It is not enough for us to know authority in an abstract way. We have to know it in a practical way through Christ. Had Christ not carried out submission to its consummate conclusion, He would not have been able to return to heaven. He took an unimaginable risk upon Himself when He chose not to return to heaven through the pathway of His divinity. In one sense He lived His human life without divine intervention. He exercised His submission in the position of a man. This was the basis of His exaltation. Today Jesus is Lord; God has bestowed on Him the highest name, the name in which every knee must bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth. Today we are commissioned to preach in this name, and we are made to partake of this name. Here are two things: doing things in His name and coming under His name. What is the difference between these two things? Mrs. Weigh is free to do things in the name of Brother Weigh. This is because she has first given herself to come under his name. After she has given herself to come under his name, she has the right to partake of all that her husband has. In order for us to walk and do things in the Lord's name, we must first belong to His name. First, we are baptized into His name. This is the basis for us to walk and do things in His name.</p><p>Once we have the name of Jesus, everything becomes simple. We can overcome all things and deal with all problems. We are called Christians because we are called into Christ's name. We are the same as He is in everything, except that He is the male and we are the female counterpart. The names Solomon and Shulamite are the same word in Hebrew; one is masculine and the other feminine. The question now remains whether or not we are able to use His name and do things in His name. We have to realize the source of His name. He submitted Himself to the uttermost. There was no rebellion in Him whatsoever. He did not have any opinion of His own, and there was no trace of insubordination in word or attitude. He upheld God's authority to the uttermost. Through this submission He received His name. I do not know if you realize the gravity of this matter. When the Lord sent the seventy disciples to cast out demons, He told them to act in His name. This means He committed His name to the disciples and allowed them to use it freely. It seems as if the Lord was saying, "Take My name and tell the demons to get out!" The Lord told the disciples in John 14 and 16 that whatever they asked of the Father in His name, the Father would give to them (14:13-14; 16:23). It seems as if the Lord was saying that whatever is asked of the Father in His name is counted as His own asking. Luke 24:47 says, "Repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name." The Lord intends for men to grant others forgiveness, to cast out demons, and to petition the Father in His name. The Chinese way of authorization is not by signature but by seal. As long as one has the right seal, he can conduct business. A seal is good enough for withdrawing money from the bank and for conducting transactions. If the government or the state commits its official seal to you, it is a very serious matter. If you use the seal by mistake, the government will bear the consequences. When the Lord says that we can do things in His name, it means that He has entrusted His "seal" to us. Whenever we use the seal, the Lord will validate it. This name is committed to our hand. Whatever we say, He will do.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO APPLY THE NAME OF JESUS</h2><p>When we apply the Lord's name, He will honor it. Brothers and sisters, do we see our position? If we have not seen it yet, we cannot work for the Lord. It seems as if the Lord is saying, "If you dare to say yes to anyone, I will say yes as well." This is the reason the Lord said in Matthew 18:18, "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven." The Lord has put His authority in our hand. Who are we? Suppose we become rebellious and disobedient and exercise this name irresponsibly. Everything will be thrown into confusion. The Lord says that He will back up whatever promise we give to others. Those who do not see the gravity of their responsibility are foolish; they are living in darkness. In receiving the saints, we cannot receive those whom we like and reject those whom we dislike. We are doing it in the name of the Lord, and we cannot be careless. The more the Lord entrusts Himself to us, the more careful we must be. We should say, "I am not qualified to use this name. I am afraid of making mistakes." The greater the commission, the more we should walk in submission. This is not a small matter. The responsibility is too great. Only a careless and foolish person will act rashly when he receives such a commission. Actually, we are not qualified to do things in the Lord's name at all. We need to experience the Lord's breaking before we can learn obedience little by little, and before we can work in His name. What if we belong to the category of those described in the Gospels, who use the Lord's name but do not follow Him (Mark 9:38)? Or what if we are walking after the footsteps of the seven sons of Sceva in Acts, who took it upon themselves to cast out demons in the name of the Lord? They acted in the name of the Lord, yet they did not know the Lord. The demons ignored them (19:13-16). I am not asking if we are able to do a certain thing. I am asking if we dare to do it if the Lord commits His name to us. No one working for the Lord should fail to be struck by the aura and tremendous honor of doing things in His name. It is most glorious for the Lord to entrust His name to us when we preach His word. This does not give us license to speak in any way we want. Rather, we should learn to submit to authority. If we do not know authority and if we are ignorant about obedience, we will not be able to do anything. Every worker of the Lord has to be able to apply the name of Jesus. The Lord has given this seal to us unconditionally. What should we do? Only a foolish man would dare to use it carelessly. When authority is in my hand, I am induced to greater submission. I would not dare to be careless or rash.</p><p>In the Gospels the Lord Jesus made reference to His own name no more than twenty times. But after His resurrection the New Testament speaks of His name more. The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord's name in reference to coming events as does Luke 10. Acts speaks of His name thirty-seven times. In Acts 4:12 we find that the one thing the Jewish synagogue opposed was this very name. Acts records the sequence of events which happened after the Lord's ascension. In this book we find the greatest number of references to doing things in the Lord's name. Today we have the Lord's name. We can keep this name like a gold or silver coin in our pocket, and we can use it any time we want. The preaching of the apostles in all the Epistles, beginning with the book of Romans, involves the exercise of this name.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NAME JESUS AND THE NAME OF JESUS</h2><p>There is a difference between the name Jesus and the name of Jesus. The name Jesus was given by man to the Lord when He was on earth. Jesus was His personal name on earth. Philippians 2, however, tells us that when the Lord resurrected and ascended, God gave Him the name which is above every name, the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus exceeds all other names. Although the two expressions appear to be the same, they are very different in flavor. In Matthew 1 we have the name Jesus, and in Philippians 2 we have the name of Jesus. The two names are different in scope. After His resurrection, the Lord's name was exalted above all other names. In the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING SUBJECT TO AUTHORITY AND<br />TAKING THE NAME OF JESUS WITH CARE</h2><p>Now the name which is above every name has been given to us. The name of Jesus is living. The example of a seal is not very appropriate because a seal is dead, while the name of Jesus is living. This name is more accessible to us than a dead seal. The Lord says that we can now act in His name. How should we act? We dare not act rashly. We must first touch God's authority and know what it means to submit to this authority. We must be subject to it before we dare to use the name of Jesus fearfully. Our eyes must be opened to see that authority is in the name of Jesus; we do not have any authority in ourselves. Today God has given us His name; we can walk and act in His name, but we must act the same way as the Lord. The Lord received this name through the process of submission. Before we can apply this name, we must also learn submission.</p><p>Do not think that the church has fallen into desolation. On the one hand, we can say that the church is in ruin. But on the other hand, it is not in ruin, because the name of Jesus is still here. The light we have received today is much brighter than at the time of the apostles. They only had the beginning; we have the consummation. We are closer to the day of the Lord than Paul. Therefore, we have to humble ourselves under God's hand. May we not be sloppy or careless in anything.</p><p>Today Satan has no authority of his own; all authority is in Christ. All the power added together cannot overcome authority, and all authority is in the Lord's hand. It seems as if the Lord is saying, "Go and do whatever you will and say whatever you will; I will honor it." For this reason our flesh must be dealt with. The name of Jesus is applicable both to God and to the devil. It is only a matter of how we are going to apply this name. May we prostrate ourselves before God and drive away any spirit of rebellion. May we see greater accomplishments in these days than in the days of the apostles. If we speak only positively and speak nothing negatively, we will have a continual open door before us. If we are absolute in our submission, we will be free to supplicate for others, confess our sins to God, and wait on Him&mdash;all in the name of Jesus.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE CONDITION FOR<br />BEING AN AUTHORITY&mdash;SUBMISSION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: July 3, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><p>The condition for knowing God's authority is submission, and the result of knowing His authority is also submission. The more we are obedient, the more we will see God's authority. God's requirement for His appointed authority is submission. Those who cannot submit to authority will never be chosen by God to be an authority. When the Lord was on earth, He praised only one Gentile&mdash;the centurion (Matt. 8:10). Other than him, He hardly recommended anyone. The centurion was praised because he knew authority; he had learned the meaning of faith from his understanding of authority. He knew that authority was in the Lord's word; he knew the meaning of authority. He said, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" (v. 9). The centurion knew that he had authority above him, that he was a man under authority. He also was aware of being an authority to his subordinates.</p><p>Perhaps it is too early for us to speak of authority today. The authority which the church possesses today is spiritual. We must wait for the kingdom to come before we will possess actual authority. The full manifestation will come in the next age. Then the glory, the kingdom, and the authority will all be Christ's. Today is not the time for the church to reign; this is only a time of training and preparation. Dispensationally speaking, it is too early to speak of authority today. However, we have ground to speak about authority today because God has appointed deputy authority in the church today. A servant of the Lord must come to know authority and submission. If a man has never seen the matter of authority, he can never submit. On the other hand, if a man does not have the experience of submission, he can never be an authority.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY<br />BEING SUBMISSION TO GOD</h2><p>I hope that those who are learning to be an authority will not have a wrong concept: In leading those who, under God's sovereignty, are under them, they should not try to lead them to submit to them. Instead, they should lead them to submit to God's authority. They should not try to lead someone to meet men, but to meet God. If a man only meets men, he still does not know the meaning of authority. Those who have never met God are not submitting to God, but to men only. Actually, a person who has never touched God's authority will never submit to men. In God's sovereignty and according to the order of His authority, some people are placed under us. If we are the deputy authority to them, we have to realize that we are not asking submission for ourselves; we are leading them to submit to God. It is a great mistake for anyone to expect others to submit to himself.</p><p>God has no intention to uphold your own dignity. He has no intention for wives, children, and slaves to just submit to their husbands, fathers, and masters. God's intention is for man to submit to Him. The submission which God requires from man is the same in nature as the path which He has designated for man; it is submission to God. We are not here to maintain our own dignity or position. We are not here to carry out our own order, but to execute God's authority. If we demand that others submit to us, we are merely leading them to touch ourselves. If we are under the illusion that authority means for others to submit to us, we need to go back to the very basics in our training. A deputy authority is merely a temporary appointment from God. We submit to a certain person because he represents God's authority. If we rebel against him, we are offending God's authority. For example, a few brothers from Shangtung once came to our meeting in Yu-Hua-Chun [Editor's note: a training center in Shanghai]. I spoke to them about submission to authority. (At that time I did not have the liberty to say too much.) When they heard it, they tried to practice submission. But when they returned to Chefoo, they would not submit to Brother Witness. These ones only touched men. If we have touched only men, but not touched God's authority, we do not know authority. Those who have seen God's authority will find authority wherever they go.</p><p>In our submission, we must meet God Himself, not just men. Suppose we teach a child in Foochow about electricity and let him touch a bare wire. He will feel the shock from the current. If he goes to Shanghai and tries to touch electricity there, he will feel the same thing. This will teach him not to meddle with electricity carelessly. If he has only touched an insulated wire, however, he has not experienced electricity itself. He may find an electrified wire with black or yellow insulation and play with it out of curiosity. In real life, of course, the result still could be tragic. We are not here to teach men to touch the insulation around the electrical wire, but to help them to touch electricity itself. We have to help people to know authority, not the figures who represent authority. Unless we give them this proper help, we are sending them to certain disaster.</p><h2 class="head1">A DEPUTY AUTHORITY MUST NOT TRY<br />TO UPHOLD HIS OWN AUTHORITY</h2><p>A deputy authority must not try to uphold his own authority. If you think that you can demand obedience, that your position, gift, or power justifies such a demand, you are not qualified to be an authority. If your disposition is such that you want others to obey you, you are not qualified to be an authority; you are not the type of person who can receive submission from others. The result of rebellion, no matter where it occurs and no matter whom it is directed against, is the overturning of God's authority, not a challenge to man's demand. If you are challenged as a deputy authority, you have to realize that others are not offending you; there is no need for you to jump up in defense of yourself. They are offending the authority whom you represent. In reality they are rebelling against God's authority. Whenever rebellion occurs, you should uphold God's authority and grieve for its neglect. As for you, there should be no feeling of personal offense. Whether an offense is directed against you or not, the ultimate challenge is against God's authority. As for you, you must be willing to be set aside. Although the apostles played a leading role in God's work, they were not afraid of being offended in the matter of authority; their prime concern was upholding God's authority. You should never be concerned with rejection. You should have no personal expectation of your own; you are here to uphold God's authority. If anyone has offended you, you should say to yourself, "I am merely a deputy authority; I am also ignorant in many areas."</p><p>If anyone offends God's authority, this offense has nothing to do with me personally; I merely acknowledge the anointing's presence. Except for the fact that God has placed His authority upon me, I have no desire to assume any authority of my own. Others do not have to submit to me. Even when others submit to me, I know that it is because God's authority is upon me. At the same time, when I find God's anointing resting upon a person, I will submit to him. The two hundred and fifty leaders among the Israelites offered incense to God; they sinned and were judged and destroyed. But what happened to the censers? They were not destroyed. God ordered that they be hammered into plates and used as a covering for the altar, because the censers were sanctified already (Num. 16:36-38). This does not mean that the brass of those censers was different from the brass of any other kind of censers. If there is any difference at all, the difference lies in the fact that it was touched by God. Is there anything we have which has not been received from God? If there is any difference between us and others, it is because God's authority is upon us. Other than this authority, we are no different than anyone else. Philemon was the same as Onesimus, and Aquila and Priscilla were the same. Can we say that all masters are better than their servants? Can we say that all fathers are better than their sons? Can we say that all husbands are better than their wives? Why then does God want servants to obey masters, wives to obey husbands, and children to obey parents? He wants this because this is the order of authority He has arranged. This is unrelated to whether or not a person is good or bad. It is God who has ordained everything.</p><p>No deputy authority is self-appointed. I do not choose to be an authority myself. Every one of us has to know that authority is from God. There is no authority that is not from God. If someone obeys us, we have to know that this happens because God has ordained it. The same principle applies to our submission to authority and our acting as the authority to others. All authority is appointed by God. It is a gross mistake for us to think that we are an authority by ourselves or to try to establish ourselves as the authority. It is wrong for any brother to recommend himself as the authority. We should not uphold ourselves. We do not have any intrinsic authority within ourselves. All of man's authority comes from outside of him; God is the One who has appointed him to be the authority. If there is any authority in us, this authority should merely lead others to obey God's authority in us; it should not demand that others obey us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF DEPUTY AUTHORITY&mdash;OBEDIENCE</h2><p>Everything about a deputy authority hinges on the kind of obedience he renders to other authorities above him. We must not have any craving to be a deputy authority or any expectation of others obeying us. We should only expect to obey others; obedience should be our very nature. If we are not obedient, we will not feel peaceful or comfortable within. The obedience I am speaking of here is different from the obedience spoken of in other places. Elsewhere obedience is spoken of in a shallow way because the speakers have not touched God's authority themselves. This obedience only touches men; it is not directly linked to God's authority. No matter where we go, there is plenty of opportunity for us to obey and submit. There should be an inner longing within us to look for objects of submission. Love, mercy, and meekness should be our very nature; so should obedience. If a person does not have the opportunity to express his love, he feels unhappy. The same can be said of obedience. Within us there is a longing to submit to others, and as soon as we find the object of our submission, we are relieved and happy. This is to walk according to our very nature. Unless we can express this very nature of obedience, we cannot be entrusted with any authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF ABSALOM</h2><p>Absalom was David's son. David was his authority; yet he stole men to himself to listen to his judgment. He attracted men to himself and usurped his father's authority (2 Sam. 15:1-6). He wanted to be appointed king and wanted others to see that he could be a better king than his father. As far as his position was concerned, Absalom was in line to the throne of David. Yet he tried to usurp the throne by his own method. The principle of Absalom was the principle of rebellion; he did not want to subject himself to the authority of David; he tried to establish his own authority instead. Being an authority means to submit to God's authority. Only those who submit to authority can be an authority. Absalom's principle was a deadly one. He tried to usurp authority and assume the kingship by his own flesh. He rebelled against David's authority and attempted to establish his own authority. In the end he was rejected by God. Anyone who tries to assume authority by himself is a rebellious Absalom. His end will be God's sure rejection. Whenever a man tries to be an authority, he is saying that he does not want God's authority. Absalom did not care for God to establish him as the authority. As a result, God did not appoint him as the authority. David was a man who willingly gave up his own authority. In Absalom we see the opposite. This is the reason David found favor in God's sight while Absalom was rejected. Absalom did a fine job when he judged the people at the gate of the city. In man's eyes he was a good judge, but his goal was to usurp authority. God does not want man to be motivated by ambition for authority. If a man craves being an authority, he will end up either in death or rebellion. This is the principle of Absalom. When we move to a place and find someone who wants to be an authority, we should not allow him to be one. (This is different from aspiring for overseership and desiring a good work in 1 Timothy 3:1.)</p><p>We should totally eradicate the ambition for authority within us. We should loathe the desire to rule over others. Unless we are free from these thoughts, we are not worthy of God's trust. If our mind is set on being an authority, we do not know the meaning of submission. We have to learn to submit to authority from our heart. Everyone who murmurs and complains does not know authority. Only submissive ones find others submitting to them. Only an obedient man can lead others to a knowledge of authority. In the world an authority commands respect and admiration from others. In the spiritual realm it is altogether different. In the world only certain kinds of people can be an authority; they have to act certain ways. For example, the principal of a school has to act like a principal. In the spiritual realm, however, an authority does not walk around in pomp and pretense; rather, he is a submissive man. The honor of the high priest is not upon a person himself, but it is given by God (Heb. 5:4). The more submissive a person is, the less he will conduct himself with pomp and pretense outwardly and the less he is likely to become an object of obedience to others. Yet these are the ones who can bring others to submission. This is absolutely different from the way of worldly authorities. We are not here to inspire men to submit to men but to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS' SUBMISSION</h2><p>Consider the pattern of the Lord Jesus. Philippians 2:8 says that the Lord was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. The Lord's humbling of Himself was something beyond human imagination. It is hard to fathom such obedience. In verse 5 Paul says that we should let "this mind" be in us, which was also in Christ Jesus. The whole passage concerns taking the mind of Christ. "This mind" is a mind that becomes "obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross" (v. 8). Having the mind of Christ is to have a mind that will obey even unto death. This mind seeks every opportunity to obey. The Son of God was in heaven; He was God, equal with God in rank, power, possession, and existence. Obedience is not a necessity within the Godhead, because there is no distinction of rank, privilege, or greatness between the Father, Son, and Spirit. As such, there is no need of obedience. Yet when Christ came to the earth, He gave up all honor, power, position, and form, and became a common man, being obedient even as a slave.</p><p>One of the wonders of the universe is that Christ refused to return to the Father through the pathway of His divinity. He returned instead through the pathway of obedience. This is like saying that even though man is able to walk on water across the sea, he insists on swimming across it. The Lord "climbed" back to God through learning obedience. The Lord had only one mind in Him. He was simple in His motive. From the beginning to the end His mind was set on obedience. He did not have any thought of gaining authority. During the thirty-three and a half years that He lived the human life, His mind was set on obedience. He did not become obedient by accident or as a result of favorable environment; He was obedient in His very mind. He was obedient everywhere and in everything. To have a mind of obedience means to actively seek for authority to come under. The Lord was always looking for God's will and to obey it. He said, "The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing" (John 5:19). The Son cannot initiate anything; He cannot act according to His own will. This is to have a mind to obey. There may be obedient men on earth, but it is difficult to find a person who has a mind to obey. A person who has a mind to obey is one who seeks for opportunity to obey all the time. He is fearful of losing any opportunity to obey. He is a person bound by obedience. The thought of taking up any form of authority is nonexistent in him. With some people obedience is conditional; they have ulterior motives in their obedience or they obey simply because it happens to fit their preference to obey. A man who has a mind to obey is different. If a man has a mind to gain a place in public office, he will set his mind on using every opportunity to reach his goal. This was how the Son was in His obedience; He was fearful that He would lose His chance for submission. He sought for every opportunity to obey. His mind was not set on being an authority. In order to establish authority, the Lord first established obedience. Without establishing obedience, He could never have established authority. Therefore, Christ came and established God's authority through His obedience. The mind of Jesus of Nazareth was one that sought and reached out for obedience.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S PRAYER IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE</h2><p>In His prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, it appears that He was afraid to take the cup. The cup represents the cross; it represents redemption. The Lord knew that man needed redemption. He came to the earth and lived for over thirty years for the purpose of going to the cross. Yet the Lord was not set on taking the cup; He was not set on going to the cross to accomplish redemption for man. He was seeking God's will. He was obedient to God's will. The Lord could choose to go to the cross or not to go to the cross. He could choose to take the cup or refuse the cup. The Lord's ultimate intention was to do the will of God. This is not an easy thing to do. God told Abraham to take Isaac to Mount Moriah and offer him up on the altar as a burnt offering. It was hard for Abraham to obey. But when Abraham took up his knife and was ready to kill, God told him to stop. This was also difficult for Abraham. He had already lifted up his knife, and it was hard for him to drop it. If Christ had refused to give up His crucifixion, His obedience would not have been perfect. Right up to the point when He was about to die, the Lord was not set on taking the cross. It would not have been a perfect obedience if the Lord had been inflexible about His crucifixion. In this respect the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was a most profound exercise. Right up to the point of His death, He was still unsettled as to His taking of the cross; He was still inquiring of God. To Him the cross was dispensable; He was not decided on this issue. He could take the cup, or He could reject it. Yet He would not insist on His own will, but only God's will. This was the Lord's mind.</p><p>Throughout the ages many theologians have seriously offended the Lord by foolishly misjudging Him. They thought that the Lord was afraid to die, that He was weak in His flesh and fearful of the bitter cup. Actually, the Lord was not afraid of death. He was trying to be certain of God's will. He could drink the cup, or He could refuse the cup, but God's will must be done. The Lord did not pray that God would allow Him to act independently; He prayed that He would act according to God's will. To Him, God's will was absolute, while the cup was relative. Our Lord never acted against God's will. Once He was clear that the cross was God's will, He told the disciples, "Arise, let us be going" (Matt. 26:46). As they were leaving the garden, the persecutors came. Peter drew his sword and struck the ear of the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear. The Lord told Peter, "Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). After the Lord became clear that the cup was God's will, He no longer hesitated. The Lord was not set on dying; He was set on obeying. It is not enough to have a mind to die or to go to the cross. The Lord had a mind to obey!</p><h2 class="head1">THROUGH OBEDIENCE THE LORD RECEIVING<br />THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY</h2><p>Philippians 2 goes on to tell us that God highly exalted Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, making Him Lord (vv. 9-11). The Lord proceeded from His divinity for the purpose of establishing God's authority. He was obedient unto death. In the end God raised Him from the dead and bestowed on Him the highest name&mdash;the name of Jesus. Now He is the Lord. We have to learn obedience every step of the way, just like Him. The Lord was obedient to the end, and God highly exalted Him and committed all authority to Him. Revelation 4 and 5 describe the situation after the Lord's ascension. All authority in heaven and on earth is no longer in God's hand; it has been given to Christ. No one can open God's scroll except the Lord (5:2, 5) because God has committed all authority to Him. Today He is God, and He is also man. He sits in heaven as a man.</p><p>Unless we are obedient all the way, we cannot express God's authority. Our submission to authority is the basis of becoming an authority. This is the straight pathway. Christ took this way before God made Him the authority. If we desire to be an authority, we must have a thorough understanding of authority and submission. We must not claim any authority for ourselves. We must have a mind to obey; we must have the mind in us that was in Christ Jesus. Even after a man becomes an authority, he must still have a mind to obey. He has to maintain this ground and practice obedience. No matter what position we have as an authority, we should still have a mind to obey. The sooner we have a mind to obey, the sooner God will make us an authority. We worship the Lord that He was so clear about the nature of authority.</p><p>Suppose the Father had said to the Lord at the end of His time on earth, "You have been on earth for thirty-three years, and You have finished the work that I have assigned to You. Now You can return to heaven." Even if the Lord had considered the cross for thirty-three years, He would have immediately returned to the Father; He would not have waited for the cross. This was the Lord's mind; He did not insist on His own will. God requires the same thing from us. He told Abraham to bring Isaac to the altar, and Abraham obeyed. Later He told Abraham to take Isaac back, telling him that his son would not die, and Abraham took Isaac back without any hesitation. God's requirement on us is no less than His requirement on Christ. We have to have this mind in us, which was in Christ Jesus. Only an obedient man can have the mind of Christ Jesus. If we have a mind that is set on obedience, God will be free to commit His authority to us just as He committed it to Christ. The scroll in Revelation 5 contains the mystery of the future of the universe. God did not open the scroll Himself. He committed it to the Lamb of God; Jesus of Nazareth was the One who opened it. God has left the execution of the plan of the universe to the Lamb. Through the Lord's absolute obedience, God entrusted such authority to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING TO TAKE<br />THE WAY OF OBEDIENCE</h2><p>We know that this is the end time and that God is recovering the church. He wants to entrust the church with His authority. During the past few days, we have seen that the church is the ultimate expression of God's authority. The church cannot fail. The church has failed during the past two thousand years, but from now on it cannot fail. It has to reach the glorious state described in Ephesians 4 and 5. In the future men will recognize authority through the church. How solemn is our responsibility today! We can no longer say that one church's failure will be compensated by another church's revival. We can fail no longer. Today the church must move at a rapid pace. God is recovering His authority through us today. Are we someone that God can trust? God's way hinges on us today. We have to be absolute in our obedience. We have to obey to the end. Otherwise, God will not have a recovery. Today rebellion still exists in the church, and unless we deal with this problem, there is no way for the church to be recovered.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />REASON AND OBEDIENCE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Morning, July 5, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><h2 class="head1">THE SOURCE OF REBELLIOUS SPEAKING&mdash;REASONS</h2><p>Man's rebellion against authority is manifested in his speaking as well as in his reasons. Those who do not know authority revile, and this reviling comes from reasoning. Man reviles because he reasons within himself. For example, Aaron and Miriam reviled Moses because Moses married a Cushite. They said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" (Num. 12:2). Our words always follow our reasons. Aaron and Miriam first reasoned in their mind. Perhaps they thought, "All three of us are servants of God, and God has spoken to all of us. Miriam is the first prophetess, and Aaron is the high priest. All of us are appointed by God. Does God speak to Moses only and not to us as well?" Apparently, nothing was wrong with such a thought; it seemed reasonable enough. Reasons are hidden in the heart, and words are uttered through the mouth. Words of rebellion occur because there are reasons within one's heart. The first cause of rebellion is reasons within one's heart. Unless one deals thoroughly with his reasons, he cannot stop his speaking.</p><p>In the Bible God never reasons with man. Where reasoning abounds, authority is absent. God's decisions are beyond the consent or dissent of human mentality or reasoning. All we need to ask is whether or not there is the presence of authority. Under God's authority, reason has no ground to assert itself whatsoever. Outwardly rebellion is expressed through our speaking. Before we open our mouth, however, we first have reasons within our heart. Unless we first are delivered from reasons, we will never find deliverance in our speaking. The speaking of Korah's company and the two hundred fifty leaders was reasonable enough in its own way. They said, "For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?" (Num. 16:3). This was not simply rebellious speaking; it was backed up by reasons. If the whole congregation was short in holiness, perhaps God's exclusive communication with Moses and Aaron was justified. But if the whole congregation was holy, how could Moses and Aaron claim that God was speaking to them alone? They judged the two leaders with their words, and their words were fully backed up by reasons and arguments. Their heart was full of reasons. As soon as we have reasons in our heart, we have words in our mouth. All revilings come from reasons. Therefore, the first expression of rebellion is reasons.</p><p>In addition to the words of Korah's company and the two hundred fifty leaders, there were also the words of Dathan and Abiram. Their words were of a cruder nature. Outwardly speaking, the words of Korah's company were more reasonable and convincing than Dathan and Abiram's. Dathan and Abiram's words implied that they were being cheated. They were sarcastic. In a mocking way they implied, "God was going to lead us into the land flowing with milk and honey, but you have brought us into the wilderness. We have not seen any land flowing with milk and honey; instead, we were led out of a land flowing with milk and honey." They thought that there were plenty of fields, meat, and vineyards in Egypt, and they thought they had none of these in the wilderness. They indeed had many reasons. A person who is under authority would never say, "Moses and Aaron said this." They would only consider what God had said. Everyone who places himself under authority does not reason; he only acts according to God's word. What the hand touches, the eyes see, and the heart feels mean nothing to him. According to human eyes, the wilderness was much inferior to Egypt, but those who walk by faith are satisfied with God's will. They walk according to God's word. The rebellious ones said, "You have brought us to a barren land to kill us. Are you going to make yourself a ruler over us? You have not led us to the land flowing with milk and honey, and have not given us fields and vineyards for our inheritance." Their words were cruder than those of Korah's company. Korah's company spoke in spiritual terms, but Dathan and Abiram spoke in material terms. We cannot help but marvel at the reasons and tongues of the rebellious ones!</p><p>Dathan and Abiram continued, "Will you put out the eyes of these men?" (v. 14). It was as if they were saying, "Are you trying to cover the eyes of everyone with your two hands? This is the wilderness. Where are the fields and the vineyards that you have promised?" Their eyes could only see the wilderness; they could not see any land flowing with milk and honey. God's promised land was not yet in sight; they could only regard the place they had left behind as being better. They thought they were very clear and that they had reasons to back up their words. Similarly, those whose eyes are on the earth are like Dathan and Abiram. Moses was not blind, but he was not acting by sight. It seems as if he was void of sight, reason, or argument. He only had God. He did what he did because God had told him to do it. Do not think that these rebellious ones were altogether wrong. In terms of human reason, they were, in fact, quite right. Human thoughts and reasons indeed have their place. Yet they do not count in the eyes of God. In our pursuit of the knowledge and the things of God, we often have to "cut out" our fleshly eyes. We have to ignore reasons and consider what God has said. Those who take the way of obedience and subject themselves to God's authority do not have anything to say. In fact, they do not have any reasons to give. Once we cast all reasons aside, our speaking stops.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING MERCY ON WHOM HE WILLS<br />AND HARDENING WHOM HE WILLS</h2><p>I will give you a little testimony. The first time I touched something concerning authority was when I read Romans 9. This chapter is hard to handle. In this chapter Paul showed how the Gentiles were called by God. First he spoke of Jacob and Esau, and then he spoke of Pharaoh as a negative example. It seems as if God was not fair in these instances. In man's eyes Jacob was naughty while Esau was honest, yet God loved the wicked Jacob and hated the honest Esau (v. 13). Paul posed the question: "Is there unrighteousness with God?", and his answer was, "Absolutely not!" (v. 14). It was as if Paul was saying, "God can do whatever He wants." If God wants to love Jacob, He can love Jacob. If He wants to hate Esau, He can hate Esau. The human mind may argue about God's treatment of Esau and find God unfair, yet God said to Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth" (v. 17). Was God unfair in hardening Pharaoh? We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority. We mortals, who are feeble as dust, have no basis to reason with Him. When I first read the Bible and came to the passage in Exodus where it says that God hardened Pharaoh, I was very surprised. God shows mercy and grace. But He also hardens men. God is the One who does everything. This is amazing. In effect, Paul was saying, "How about this for a reason? Is this not a good enough reason?" If this reason is good enough, we are stripped of all arguments for Esau and Pharaoh.</p><p>Some may ask, "Why does He still find fault? For who withstands His will?" (v. 19). In my youth, when I came across this passage, I said to myself, "I admire anyone who can understand and believe this chapter." When I came to this passage, I thought that it was impossible for Paul to present a perfect argument. I was actually worrying and sweating for him at this point. Yet I noticed that Paul did not get into any argument at all. On the contrary, he simply asked, "O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?" (v. 20). Paul did not respond with an argument. Rather, he asked, "Who are you?" It is not a matter of arguments and reasons but a matter of, "Who are you who answers back to God?" God is the God of glory, the One who sits on the throne. We are simply footstools before His throne; our place is only to obey. We must humble ourselves before Him. We have no right to argue with Him. We cannot have a round-table meeting with Him. Rather, we should prostrate in the dust before His feet. God does not have to consult us before doing anything. He does not need our consent. Only those who are equal with God can argue with Him. Are we equal with God? Men try to exalt themselves to be equal with God, but Christ humbled Himself. He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, becoming obedient (Phil. 2:6-8). How can we consider ourselves equal with God? Paul did not bother to give an answer; he did not try to furnish a reason. Instead he asked, "Who are you? How dare you say such a thing to God?"</p><p>When Paul fell on his way to Damascus, he only asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). Once a man is enlightened, he can only say, "Lord, what do You want me to do?" He has no heart to reason anymore. A servant of God must not reason; he must cast off reason from him. A man must not live in reason, but under God's authority. What can the creatures say to the Creator? Romans 9 tells us only one thing&mdash;authority. He is God; He will have mercy on whom He wills, and He will harden whom He wills (v. 18). We have nothing to say. When God says He loves Jacob, that is whom He wills to love. When He says that He hates Esau, that is whom He wills to hate. When He says that He will harden a certain man, He wills to harden that man. God acts according to His authority and nothing else; He does not act according to reasons.</p><p>We have to know God's acts, not according to reason but according to authority. Throughout history no one who truly has known God has been ignorant of His authority. We cannot reason with God, because He is the Creator. He sits on the throne, while our place is in the dust. It is beyond our grasp to even try to be His footstool. We dare not look up to His face of glory; we can only look at His feet. In order to know God, we can only take the way of submission, not the way of reason. Unless reason is fully purged from us, we cannot know God. I must strongly repeat: Those who have not been fully delivered from reason can expect little perfecting from God. They are limited in capacity and usefulness. If we desire to obtain mercy from God and to participate in His work, we have to drive away all our reasons. In God there is only command and authority. Our place before God is simply obedience and obedience alone.</p><p>We all admire the measure of life which Madame Guyon had. We cannot find her arguing with God even once. She never reasoned with God. Authority is diametrically opposed to reason. We read in God's Word that He loved Jacob and hated Esau and that He shows mercy to whom He wills and hardens whom He wills. If we are truly enlightened by this word, all our reasons will be gone. We serve God because He is God. He does not reason with us. The One we serve is God. When God says something, it is done. He is sovereign over everything; He is the highest. His glory is unmatched in every way; it is beyond man's reach. Once we reason with God, there is no more worship. Once obedience disappears, worship disappears also. Man's reason cannot stand before God. God never argues with man. He only asks, "Who are you?" Once we prostrate ourselves in the dust, all desire for reasoning goes away. We have nothing to say before God. The only thing we can do is to stand in obedience.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM REASON</h2><p>There is another lesson which we have to learn: All those who reason with God are actually not reasoning with Him, but rebelling against Him. This means they are rebelling and offending God's authority. The law of gravity operates in such a way that the lower an object is, the steadier it becomes. Those who remain in a low position before God have the greatest stability. The more a man lays low and the more he prostrates himself in the dust, the more rest he has. Those who stand on a table are more liable to fall down, but those who have fallen will not fall further. A man who has fallen needs someone to lift him up before he can walk. Once a man sees God's authority, all reasons go away. The more reasons a man has, the less experience he has of God's authority.</p><p>Numbers 16 shows us another rebellion among the people of Israel after the rebellion of Korah's company with the two hundred fifty leaders. The people accused Moses of killing God's people. This rebellion was a rebellion of the entire congregation. Even though the earth opened its mouth and swallowed Korah's company and the two hundred fifty men, the people were still blind to God's authority. They were reasoning even more than before. Finally, God was forced to judge them and punish them with the plague. Reasons come before rebellion. The root of rebellion is our reasons. In order to be delivered from rebellion, God must first deliver us from reasons.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERTHROWING THE STRONGHOLD OF REASON</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us that reasoning is a kind of stronghold. In order to obey Christ, a man must take captive his every thought and overthrow the stronghold of reasonings. Verse 5 says, "As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ." Every high thing refers to everything that hinders a man from the knowledge of God. The greatest of these things is reasonings. Once a man reasons with God, this reasoning becomes a high thing in the eyes of God. Paul said that these strongholds must be overthrown. They are erected by Satan, and they are related to reasons. When a man is not subject to Christ, he is bound by these strongholds. A man is able to obey Christ only by overthrowing these strongholds and taking captive these thoughts. Reasonings are strongholds erected by Satan. As soon as a man reasons, his thoughts are taken captive; they become bound by his reasons. The Word of God tells us how strongly reasonings influence man's whole being. Do not regard reasonings as a small thing. Once reasonings come in, thoughts become rebellious, and words and actions follow. If we can overthrow our reasons, our thoughts will spontaneously obey the Lord, and all problems will be solved.</p><p>Satan tries to imprison man with thoughts and reasons. Our thoughts are rebellious because they have been carried away by our reasons. The more reasons we have, the less we can overcome our thoughts. Everything that Satan does is backed up by reasons. He does not speak in vain; he erects strongholds within a man's thoughts and garrisons them so that the man cannot run away. Do not think that we are free when we reason within ourselves in our own room. We have to realize that we are a prisoner, chained and locked inside iron gates and walls. There is no way for us to free ourselves. There is no way for us to obey Christ. We can call 2 Corinthians 10 the "Jessie Penn-Lewis chapter." No one can match her clarity of understanding about the freedom of a Christian's mental state. Whether or not Christ's authority is in control depends on how a man thinks and how free his thoughts are, and how free a man's thoughts are depends on how much he is delivered from reasonings. Paul said that in order to overthrow the mental strongholds, a man must be powerful before God. He must overthrow reasonings with spiritual weapons so that his thoughts may be captured back to the obedience of Christ.</p><p>In reading 2 Corinthians 10, we are easily reminded of the story of Eve's rebellion against God in Genesis 3, which can be considered as a footnote to 2 Corinthians 10. Satan did not persuade Eve to sin. He merely reasoned with Eve and stirred her up to think. She looked and saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was pleasing to the eyes. She thought that the fruit was good for food and that the fruit would open her eyes and give her discernment between good and evil. There were wonderful reasons behind her action. Satan stirred up her thoughts by asking one question. As a result, Eve began to reason, and the end of this reasoning was her eating of the fruit. Action comes after reasons. After Eve reasoned with herself, she decided to ignore God's command. She thought that she could eat the fruit. She ignored God's word and allowed reasoning to come in. Please remember that reasoning has no place in the pathway of obedience. The pathway of obedience does not have any trace of reasonings. In the world no one will do anything without a reason, but in the spiritual realm, the more reasons and thoughts a person has, the less likely he will obey. For a Christian, reasons are Satan's strongholds. They close up a man's thoughts and rob him of his freedom. As soon as a man reasons, his thoughts are taken hostage. Man's reasons are always joined to his thoughts. As soon as thoughts are taken hostage, a man cannot obey Christ. If we want to be a free man and want to obey Christ, we have to overthrow the reasons in the mind with our spiritual weapons.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO TOUCH AUTHORITY</h2><p>The obedience we are speaking of today is different from the obedience that men spoke of in the past. We are saying that a man must first touch authority before he submits. There is a big difference between submission that comes after one encounters authority and submission that comes without any encounter with authority. After a man recognizes God's authority, his obedience will have a different flavor. His previous obedience was lower in quality. The new obedience is much higher in quality. Only one who has touched God's authority will possess genuine submission and know God's will. Everything depends on whether or not a man has touched God's authority. Once this matter is settled, all other problems are solved. Once this issue is dealt with, all revilings will stop, and all reasoning will cease.</p><p>If the Lord reveals Himself to us today, we will behave differently when we walk into the kitchen tomorrow; we will act obediently according the cook's order. When we come together, we will not need to form a committee to discuss the order of submission. Our reasonings and thoughts will be captured, and we will do nothing but look for those to whom we should submit. Those who are under authority obey the Lord's commands; their eyes are not set on how others behave. Instead, they identify the authority that rests in others and obey accordingly. In no other passage of the Bible do we find God speaking to His children like He does in Romans 9. This chapter shows us that God never reasons. In other places we find examples of reasonings. Romans 6, 7, and 8 all have fine reasonings. God has a basis for doing things, but Romans 9 tells us that God's selection is based on His will, His calling, His choice, and His sovereignty; no reasons need be given. Here we touch God Himself. He is the Lord high above, and we should prostrate ourselves before His authority. True worship comes not only from the cross but from a knowledge of God's authority. When we see that He is high above, we will realize how small we are. This contrast will invoke us to genuine worship. We do not have to know whether God's actions are good or bad. We only need to know that God has done it and be satisfied with it. Once we see that the Lord occupies the highest place, we will render Him the greatest worship.</p><p>Once we know God's glory and authority, our reasonings and rebellious thoughts will go away. May the Lord have mercy on us so that the eyes of our understanding would not be blinded by Satan through our reasonings and thoughts. May we not take the way of the recovery in vain. May the Lord deliver us from all reasons, all spirits of rebellion, and all defiant thoughts.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THOUGHTS AND SUBMISSION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Morning, July 6, 1948<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 10:4-5</h1><p>Today we want to continue our discussion with 2 Corinthians 10:4-5. Every high thing is translated "edifices" by Henry Alford. It means tall buildings. It is used to describe structures, edifices, erected in one's heart. The word thought is noema in the original language. It is used six times in the New Testament: once in Philippians and five times in 2 Corinthians. In 2 Corinthians 2:11 it is translated as schemes, and in 3:14, 4:4, 10:5, and 11:3 it is rendered thoughts. It carries more of an idea of volition than of mental activity, and it can alternatively be translated as "purpose in the heart."</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CAPTIVE THE THOUGHTS</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us that the high things in man are strongholds; they are the things that hinder a man from knowing God. For example, an unbeliever has many excuses; these are his strongholds. Every time he is asked to believe in the Lord, he turns to these excuses to protect himself. He says that he is busy or that he has prior engagements. These are reasons which a man uses to fence himself in, reasons by which he rejects God. They are actually the work of Satan. We should note, however, that these verses refer to believers who have been taken captive in their thoughts. All the high things that hinder a man from knowing God must be overthrown before his thoughts can be taken captive. To take captive means to capture. God overthrows our strongholds for the purpose of capturing our thoughts. This is the only way that we can come to the obedience of Christ. By nature, man's thoughts are free; they operate according to their own will. If they are left to themselves, they will never come to the obedience of Christ. Our thoughts must be made a slave before they can serve the Lord. Our thoughts represent our existence as an independent person. Our mind first judges certain things to be good, thinks about them, and finally makes decisions based upon them. Our proposals and decisions represent our very being. In order to maintain our personal freedom, we have to make decisions. In order to preserve ourselves and justify our decisions and ideas as being superior, we surround ourselves with many reasons. We have to maintain that our way is right, and we provide reasons to justify why we forbid anyone to touch our decisions. We fortify ourselves with all kinds of reasons, like village folks who protect their hamlets with barracks and fortifications. This is what happens when a man's thoughts are surrounded by strongholds.</p><p>Yesterday I said that a servant of God must not reason. Everyone who wants to serve the Lord must have his eyes opened to Romans 9; he must experience this chapter. It is not enough to stop one's speaking or reasonings; his thoughts must be taken captive. The mouth has to be stopped, and reasons have to go away. More than this, the thoughts have to be taken captive and stripped of all ideas and proposals. The stopping of one's mouth is merely a superficial dealing. Inwardly one has to deal with reasons and thoughts. A man must have reasons overthrown and thoughts captured before he can be brought to the obedience of Christ. It is easy to spot those who can submit to authority. It is not hard to identify those who have touched authority. Those who have touched authority and who practice genuine submission are bridled in their tongues; they do not have many reasons. Neither do they propose many things. Those who have not touched authority always try to fortify their own thoughts with reasons and proposals. A day will come when a man's thoughts are taken captive; they will be "kidnapped." That will be the day when he is brought to the obedience of Christ.</p><p>Many people like to be God's counselors. They want God to listen to them and take their advice. They think they can draft God's blueprints. Wherever the ones whose thoughts are not captured go, they want to make improvements instead of live out submission. Their favorite expression is, "To me, this is wrong, and that is wrong. You have to do this and that." Their thoughts and reasonings are never held in check, and they can never be submissive. We have to be dealt with to the point that our thoughts are captured. Our proposals must be dealt with before we can see authority. If we are full of self-ideas and self-proposals, we do not know authority. There are two omniscient beings in this universe&mdash;God and the self. We want to be men's counselor, and we also want to be God's counselor. We want to change everything around wherever we go. It seems as if we know everything. This clearly shows that our thoughts are not captured; we still do not know authority. Obeying Christ means to be under authority, to stop all proposals, and to lose all interest in making proposals. We should become persons without any conception; our only desire should be to obey. Those who have touched God's authority have no desire to make proposals. They only care to obey.</p><h2 class="head1">PAUL'S THOUGHTS BEING CAPTURED</h2><p>Paul, who was Saul, was an intelligent, clever, and rational person. He was very resourceful, and he served God with his own zeal. On his way to Damascus to arrest Christians, he met a great light and fell to the ground. From that day forward, he was stripped of his own proposals and ideas. He asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" He no longer wanted to do anything by himself. Once he met the great light, he became foolish. He no longer had any plans or proposals. May the Lord give us such "foolishness," a "foolishness" that results from enlightenment. Light not only humbles us but silences us. Once a man touches God's authority and sees His light, he does not have to suppress his words or muzzle his proposals. Spontaneously his cleverness, concepts, and suggestions are gone. He is conscious of his captivity. He is brought to the obedience and rule of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF REBELLION IN THOUGHTS</h2><p>Let us consider some Old Testament examples of thoughts that were not taken captive. First we have Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron. Their sin was different from the sins of others. Others sinned by indulging in the flesh. Nadab and Abihu sinned in the matter of serving the Lord. They proposed something by themselves and offered strange fire. They did not subject themselves to their father's authority. Instead, they made proposals on their own and offered sacrifices with their censers. Their sin was an offense against God and against His minister. They thought that they were doing a good thing, but they actually were offering incense according to their own conviction. They thought they were rendering service to God. They thought that even if they were wrong, their mistake would fall within the realm of divine service. They thought that it was serious and fatal to commit worldly sins but that it was minor and inconsequential to commit mistakes in God's service. Little did they realize that God immediately rejected them and sentenced them to death. Their actions were the result of their runaway thoughts. They had their own ideas about divine service, and the result was terrible.</p><p>Consider the case of King Saul. He was rejected because he kept the best of the sheep and oxen for himself. He considered it a waste to destroy these choice goods. He was not rejected because he stole, robbed, or extorted from the people of Israel. He had many reasons and ideas. He wanted to offer these as sacrifices to God. He wanted to please God in his own way. If a man has not touched authority, his thoughts will always be a problem to him. It is not a matter of whether or not one has the desire to serve the Lord, but a matter of the means he uses to serve the Lord. He should not think that he can act according to his own will as long as he has a desire to serve God. This is where many people stumble. In God's service no one can propose anything. God is the One who proposes. Even if He appoints us to be a king, He does not want us to make any proposal of our own. He only wants us to be an executor of His order and His will. It is wrong for us to think that we can tell others what to do just because we have been appointed by God to be an authority. We should have only one aspiration, which is to find out what God wants us to do. God says that obedience is better than sacrifice and taking heed better than the fat of rams. Saul did not realize that he had no right to propose anything to God; he had no right to make suggestions to God. Man can only say, "Lord, what do You want me to do? Your servant is listening." Our place is in the dust and among the footstools. Saul saw the excellent and fat livestock and thought it a waste to destroy them. He wanted to save them and offer them to God. Would it not be much better to save them? Saul had a heart to serve God; he had a heart to make sacrifices, but he did not have a heart to obey. Rather than offering everything to the Lord, it is better for him to say, "Lord, I dare not make any proposals or suggestions of my own; I want to obey You in everything." No oblation of fat or offering of fragrance can take the place of obedience. In the end Samuel told Saul, "Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah,/He has also rejected you from being king" (1 Sam. 15:23b). The Lord ordered Saul to destroy the Amalekites and all their livestock, but Saul did not want to do it. Ultimately, a young Amalekite killed Saul (2 Sam. 1:8-10). God wanted Saul to destroy all the Amalekites, but he would not do it. In the end he was killed by an Amalekite, and his reign ended. This is a serious thing.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY OF SUBMISSION</h2><p>During the past two weeks, I have been speaking on the subject of submission. Nothing in this world can be more beautiful than seeing a group of people who know authority. Among those who know authority, no one makes proposals or suggestions lightly. No one harbors any spirit of rebellion or utters any word of rebellion. When others contact them, they remark, "What a group of truly submissive people!" Within these ones there is not a trace of rebellion. Everyone serves by keeping his own place. When this happens, we will have a glorious day; it will be the kingdom of the Lord among us. The Lord will be able to point to us and say, "At least I have one group of people on earth who will submit to authority." It is true that God has Christ, His Firstborn, who is submissive to Him. He is the firstfruit, but God is waiting for His many sons to render the same testimony of obedience. As long as there is one church that is absolute, that obeys absolutely, and that renders a testimony of submission to God, Satan will be defeated, even if this church is small in number. However, if we operate according to Satan's principle, we will be a laughingstock to him even if we are zealous in our own way. Even if we preach the gospel, suffer for the Lord, accomplish great works, and increase in number, Satan will say, "You are on my side, and together we are against God." This is a sure way to mockery. We should never denigrate ourselves to such a low state as to serve God according to Satan's principles.</p><p>From now on, our feeling concerning the matter of obedience and submission should be different. It should be different from what it was before we came to Foochow. If our feelings remain the same, I have nothing more to say. Our submission must be different. The way is clear. From today forward, we have to learn to bridle our speaking, cut our reasons, and stop making proposals in our mind. This is very crucial. If we set our mind on learning this lesson, God will bless us. When the queen of Sheba beheld Solomon's glory, she had no more spirit in her (1 Kings 10:4-5). When God reveals His glory to us, we will fall down, and spontaneously we will submit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY TO SERVE GOD&mdash;FULL SUBMISSION</h2><p>According to the law of Moses, only the Levites were qualified to carry the ark of God. When the Israelites entered Canaan, it was the Levites who carried the ark across the river Jordan. The riverbed was rough, but the ark did not fall (Josh. 3:15-17). When David became king, he wanted to receive the ark into his city, yet he did not inquire of God concerning how it should be carried. He made his own proposal and followed the example of the Philistines by ordering the ark to be carried by an oxcart (1 Sam. 6:7-12). The oxen stumbled, and the ark fell. Uzzah reached out for the ark without a second thought to what he was doing, and God struck him dead (2 Sam. 6:1-7). But even if the ark had not fallen, even if it had remained safely on the cart, it was still not on the shoulders of the Levites. This shows us that God does not want man to make any proposals of his own. In our service we have to obey God. Brothers and sisters, please remember: Either we do not serve God at all, or we should serve without any idea or suggestion of our own. In order to serve our God, we have to submit to authority. We can never come to God with our own opinions. If we hold on to our own opinions, we will never serve God well. We may still claim that we are working for the church or for Christianity, but we cannot say that we are serving God. In order to serve God, we have to take a different way&mdash;the way of full submission. God has to be in control of everything. We cannot propose anything. Our human opinions have to be thoroughly destroyed.</p><p>In talking to many brothers and sisters about their service, I have discovered that many have never been dealt with in their natural disposition, personality, opinion, and thought. Many people are too free in their thoughts. Their thoughts have not been taken captive; they have never touched God's authority. How can a man be brought to the obedience of Christ? Second Corinthians 10 tells us that our thoughts must first be taken captive by the Lord. Instead of acting freely as in the past, we must now allow the Lord to capture our thoughts. We must now be imprisoned by Christ, instead of by the strongholds of our own reasonings. This passage is related to Eve's temptation in Genesis 3. Eve saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was pleasing to the eyes and good for food, and that it would give her wisdom. She began to reason in her heart, and her thoughts went after Satan's will. Her thoughts were taken captive by Satan. This was the beginning of man's fall. Our thoughts are the problem to our service of the Lord. May God grant us the strength to destroy all reasons and to shatter all the things that we consider reasonable. Once the power of God comes, all self-exalted edifices and strongholds will be destroyed, and we will have a captured mind to submit to Him. Unless our thoughts are captured, we can never submit to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">A CHANNEL FOR GOD TO EXPRESS HIS AUTHORITY</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:6 says, "And we are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled." How is one's obedience fulfilled? It is fulfilled in the condition prescribed in verse 5, that is, in being taken captive in one's thoughts. When this happens, obedience is fulfilled. It is only as a man's thoughts are taken captive that his obedience is fulfilled. When a man holds on to his opinions and proposals, his obedience is not fulfilled. Paul had worked in Corinth and had witnessed three groups of men there: those who were generally disobedient, those who were obedient, including Paul, and those who were rebellious. God's Word says that when the thoughts of the disobedient ones were taken captive and their obedience was fulfilled, they would join Paul and the obedient ones, whose obedience was already fulfilled. When the two groups of obedient ones would join together, God would execute judgment upon the rebellious ones. I do not know how many obedient ones God will gain. But I believe that when the obedience of some is fulfilled, they will not only render a good testimony but will also afford God a highway through which He can deal with all rebels and rebellions in this world.</p><p>When each of us leaves this place, we have to learn to be captured. We should not seek freedom. Our thoughts have to be captured by Christ. If we allow this to happen, the way before us will be glorious. If throughout this land we find disciplined tongues that are bridled in speech, tempered minds that are free from reasonings, and captured thoughts that are free from self-opinions, God will manifest His authority on earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS CONCERNING<br />SUBMISSION AND AUTHORITY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Morning, June 29, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain</h1><p>Brother Suen Lu-dian: You said that God does not want man to obey His authority while being rebellious to a deputy authority. What should a person do if his parents forbid him from going to the meetings?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We have to differentiate between submission and obedience. Submission is a matter of inward motive and attitude, while obedience is a matter of outward act and move. According to God's Word, we should be absolute and unconditional in our submission, but relative and conditional in our obedience. In Acts 5:29 Peter said, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." If someone in authority wants us to sin, we have to be submissive in attitude but we should not obey. For example, a mother may try to force her daughter to join her in a mahjong game. It is wrong for a Christian to engage in mahjong, and the daughter must not obey her mother. Yet she should still be respectful and submissive in her attitude, and she should not be rebellious or argumentative in any way. She can lower her head and softly say, "Mother, I do want to honor your word. I wish I could obey you, but I cannot follow you in this matter because I have believed in the Lord." Submission is absolute, while obedience is relative. In Acts the Jewish Sanhedrin forbade the apostles from preaching the gospel. The apostles were submissive in their attitude, but they had to be faithful to the Lord's gospel commission, and they could not heed the prohibition of the Jewish council. However, they did not disobey in a rancorous and tumultuous way; rather, they disobeyed humbly. There should not be any malicious remark or rude expression. Once a man touches authority, he becomes soft and tender. If a man is rough and hard, it proves that he has never touched God's authority. Even when a submissive man disobeys, he disobeys meekly and tenderly. If the deputy authority is wrong, one can put off the matter of obedience, but there is still the absolute need of submission. We cannot bang the table or stomp the floor. We cannot drop our countenance or raise our voice. We cannot disobey in this way. The Bible does not allow anyone to say to his parents, "Whatever you would have been profited by me is now corban. I do not have to take care of you anymore" (Mark 7:10-12). Submission in heart, attitude, and word is absolute. We have to be firm about these three points. As long as something is not sinful, it should serve as a gateway for us to learn submission and obedience. Our submission must be absolute, while our obedience depends on the nature of the matter. Many people have a problem with obedience because they have a rebellious spirit. If we take care of our heart, our attitude, and our words, we will be proper persons.</p><p>Whenever there is a conflict between deputy authority and direct authority, we can choose to submit to the deputy authority but not to obey him. Any prohibition of God's commission, such as a ban on the preaching of the gospel, should be met with submission, not obedience. Any charge to commit God's forbidden acts, such as an enjoinment to sin, should likewise be met with submission, not obedience. We cannot revile the rulers of the state or our parents. We cannot stage revolutions or insurrections. In attitude and heart we should always be submissive. The preaching of the gospel, however, is a direct injunction of the Lord; no matter how much men oppose us, we should still persevere in it. Nebuchadnezzar commanded all men to worship his image, but God's people could not obey him even though he was the king. In all other things we should submit and obey.</p><p>Dr. F. B. Meyer once spoke of a sister who came to him, asking, "My mother takes me to many social functions. I feel that they are not profitable, and I do not like to go. I often have tried to turn down my mother's invitations, but I know I should submit to her. What should I do?" Dr. Meyer said, "You should go, but you should ask the Lord to guard your heart." When a man is taught by God, he is softened. The daughter in this case should have said to her mother, "I will go, but I would prefer that you allow me not to go." If she did not stand on the ground of submission, it would be useless even if she stayed home. Inwardly there still would not be submission in her. After the sister heard Dr. Meyer's word, she accompanied her mother to the social functions, but she was different. Before there had always been a rumbling in her heart as well as on the floor, but now there was no rumbling in her heart and no noise on the floor. She experienced more blessing by going than by staying behind. Children should always be submissive in their attitude toward their parents, but their actual conduct should be determined by the circumstance, especially when the actions are of a questionable nature. When parents force their children to go to certain places, their children may go along with much stomping and trampling. They may go in a fit of anger and return in a fit of anger. Some parents may want their children to sin, and their children may choose to stay with a rebellious attitude at home. In either case&mdash;whether or not the children go with their parents&mdash;they have gained no spiritual lesson from their action.</p><p>In the case of parents stopping their children from going to meetings, we do not have a clear-cut situation. This is a borderline case. A person's attitude to his parents in such a case should be, "I wish I could go to the meeting. If you do not allow me to go, I will submit and stay, but I hope that you will allow me to go next time." If we argue with our parents for two hours and insist on going to meetings, we are not acting in a way that is becoming as a Christian. Parents may want their children to go to places that the children do not want to go. If sin is not involved in the matter, there is not a clear decision. Submission is absolute, but obedience is another matter. If the parents insist that their children should or should not go to a certain place, the children should obey. If the parents do not insist, the children can choose. In either case, the children should be submissive in attitude. If we have this kind of attitude, God will release us in His own way.</p><p>Question: At what point in a person's experience can we say that he has seen the matter of authority?</p><p>Watchman Nee: A man's experience of salvation relates to the amount of light he has received. If a man receives enough light, he will feel the need for salvation. The same can be said about the experience of authority; it depends on the amount of light a man has received. If a man receives enough light, he will touch authority. His inner being will shrivel and be brought to submission. When grass is exposed to the scorching sun, it can do nothing but wilt. Once a man touches authority in a genuine way, several things will happen.</p><p>First, those who have touched authority look for authority wherever they go. They seek out objects of submission. This is the normal response of a person who has touched authority. He no longer is the same as what he used to be, having no fear of anything or anyone. The church is a "training institute" that trains Christians in the lesson of submission. Submission cannot be found anywhere in the world, and a Christian can only learn submission in the church. Such submission is from the heart; it is not an outward performance. Once a man learns submission, he searches for authority wherever he goes.</p><p>Second, those who have touched authority are tender. Once a man touches God's authority, he is softened. Something within him wilts away. He is not able to be tough in himself any longer. He is fearful of making mistakes, of falling into disobedience. It is easy to change such a person. Tenderness is a clear sign of an encounter with authority. Those who have touched authority are quite afraid of offending authority, even if by accident.</p><p>Third, no one who has touched authority wants to be an authority. Those who have touched authority have no desire or interest in being an authority. A man who has met authority always remains under authority; he is always afraid of making mistakes. However, many people like to be God's counselors; they like to rule over others. These ones do not know anything about authority. I do not like to be anyone's counselor or to give any proposals or opinions. I do not like to rule over others, but those who have a natural inclination for these things have never touched authority. Even if we are an authority, we have to realize that there is authority above us. How do we know that our charge to those under us is acceptable to those above us? Those who like to be God's counselor love to be an authority over others. No one is qualified to be God's counselor, but many people want to be one. A genuine authority goes through much deliberation, consideration, and prayer before he proposes anything or makes any decision. He is afraid of initiating anything that goes against the will of his authority, that is, the will of those above him. Problems often arise between husbands and wives because there is no realization of authority. When husbands and wives argue, authority is not the first priority; in fact, authority is set aside. A husband often says to his wife, "I am the authority. You must submit to me." A husband who says this does not know what it means to be an authority. This is how problems arise in many instances.</p><p>Fourth, those who have touched authority are very discreet with their tongues. A man who has genuinely touched authority has a disciplined mouth. His mouth is restricted, shut up, and he is fearful of any careless speaking. One of the greatest tests of a person is his words. Those who have touched authority are sensitive to any word that is out of place, any criticism, or any word of rebellion. Those who know authority are as sensitive to authority as they are sensitive to sin. This sensitivity is like the physical sensations of the body; as soon as it is triggered, there is a reaction.</p><p>Fifth, those who have touched authority are fully aware of rebellion in others, just as a person who has had a genuine experience of salvation knows whether or not others are saved. Similarly, those who have had a genuine experience of dealing with sins know whether or not others are involved in sin. Once we touch authority, we can turn around and identify the many rebellious acts in others. We find rebellious words here and there and find offenses against authority in many people. We find that many brothers and sisters whom we used to admire or revivalists whom we once respected have a spirit of rebellion behind them. We would not dare to criticize them, but we pity them, saying, "Such a brother or sister could have been a wonderful authority. Yet he has never touched authority himself. Oh, how much we need God's mercy!" Such a consciousness instills fear in us and prayer for others. If we have never touched authority, we are lawless, and we will not be conscious of any lawlessness in others. The first manifestation of lawlessness is rebellion, which comes from Satan. Once we touch authority, we detect the lawlessness and rebellion that is running rampant everywhere. We realize that the principle of lawlessness has saturated the whole earth and even permeated the church. We can bring the brothers and sisters into the same submission one by one by first touching authority and submitting to it ourselves. I hope that after three or five years, we will all be different. Everyone has to come under authority before he or she can be useful. We hope to see the testimony of authority manifested everywhere among the brothers and sisters. This will be something unseen and unheard of anywhere on earth. If we subject our words and our spirit to those in authority, the church will have a testimony of submission and will be able to go on. If the church is submissive, many attacks from the enemy will be eliminated. Only after we have judged ourselves can we condemn the mistakes in others, and only then will our condemnation be accompanied by much supplication. If we all learn this lesson, the church will take a big step in the way of recovery. It is easier to submit to authority than to be an authority. When we touch authority, our first reaction is to seek to submit to others and not to seek for submission from others. Unless we are brought to this point, God cannot use us to be an authority.</p><p>Question: I believe that a genuine God-fearing person would not find it hard to submit to his parents or those in authority, but among the co-workers how should we choose to whom we should submit? In a case where there are contrary opinions between two different teachers, whom should one obey? How do we know whom to follow without an absolute outward standard of judgment of spiritual authority?</p><p>Watchman Nee: If a man has never touched authority, he cannot establish a proper relationship between submission and authority while abiding by the principle of submission. Those who have touched authority can immediately identify the proper relationship between submission and authority. The New Testament describes those who offend authority as animals without reason (2 Pet. 2:10-12; Jude 8-10). There is no way for an animal to know the relationship between submission and authority. If two dogs are put together, it is impossible to appoint one as the authority and ask the other to submit to the first. When they want to fight, they simply fight. They do not know authority, and they never touch authority. The same can be said of applying the principle of submission to those who have never touched authority; it simply does not work. Once a man touches authority, all problems are solved. As soon as he offends authority, he realizes that he has offended God. It is useless to point out a mistake to a man who has never seen the matter of authority. We have to lead him to the knowledge of authority before pointing out his mistake. Once we touch authority, there is a new consciousness in us. We will not need to resort to dialogues, votes, elections, and consensus. Those who know authority are no longer like animals without reason. We cannot be hasty in our work. We have to bring others slowly and gradually under the rule of authority. This means that we must experience these things first; we first must touch authority ourselves.</p><p>In the church those who have the gift of teaching should give themselves to coordination in the Body. If a person functions as a teacher independently, it is easy for him to develop a spirit of rebellion. If we take care of the matter of coordination, things will turn out well even if there are few gifts among us. If we do not take care of coordination, however, a great gift will become a source of trouble and even a tool for rebellion. Among the elders there are always some who are more senior and more respected than others. They are the ones who should take the lead. There are also apostles who are appointed by God. But even among the apostles, there are great ones and small ones, renowned ones and not so renowned ones. Even among the twelve apostles there were differences in rank; some were leaders to the others. There is an explicit injunction in the Bible to submit to elders and apostles. However, nothing is legal among us. We cannot say that we cannot find our deputy authority because God has not explicitly pointed him out to us. If we have not met or found our deputy authority, it simply means that we are, in Peter's words, animals without reason. No remark can be stronger than this one. If someone wants to offend authority, let him offend; but as for us, we choose to submit absolutely. The Lord rebukes the antagonizers. They either fall down or slide back. If they remain in the church, we can ignore them, mark them out, and refuse to communicate with them. God will eventually prevail, and the brothers and sisters will eventually take this way.</p><p>The church can fail no longer. We should never say that the church has failed and that we will wait for the next thing to happen to rectify the situation. The church must arrive at the glory and victory of Ephesians 4 and 5. We must believe this. If the church continues to fail, what will happen to it? The kingdom will not come in to rectify the church's failure. Rather, the victory of the church ushers in the kingdom. Eventually, this victory will be extended to the world and then to the entire universe. May God set us firmly on this ground so that we never fail. If the brothers and sisters are willing to take this word, we have a way to go on. If they are not willing to take this word, we still must go on. We have to turn the whole church around so that everyone touches authority. May God prepare their hearts to be good soil. When we return to our localities, we have to find the time to pray with three or five brothers and sisters and help each one of them deal with the matter of authority and settle it. If they do not settle it now, they will not have a way to go on later. If we do not settle this matter here on the mountain, we should not leave here. We have to settle this matter right here and not postpone it. Even if we say that we cannot get through, we still have to get through. We have to force ourselves to get through in this matter. We have to be bold and strong before the Lord and be very clear about this way. We all have to make it; we should not allow anyone to say that he cannot make it. If we delay the Lord's time, I am afraid we will have to wait for another twenty years. The Lord does not have that much time. The Bible is being fulfilled, and the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith. It will reach that state. Some have asked, "What if the church cannot reach that state?" We cannot ask this. We cannot let go. My purpose for bringing us here is to get through; we cannot fail. We cannot have one part which gets through and another part which fails. The church is the final work of God on earth today. We should consider ourselves to be the final work. There will be no one after us. For this reason we must succeed.</p><p>Sister Wang Shu-ging: If some schools insist on cutting the girls' hair, what should we do? Can we sue the school?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The Bible does not permit believers to sue anyone (cf. 1 Cor. 6:1-2). If others sue us, we can respond to the suit, but we cannot initiate a lawsuit. When problems arise between believers and unbelievers, the unbelievers can be the plaintiff. Believers can defend themselves, but that is all they can do. A believer cannot turn around and file a suit. It is all right for Christians to be defendants, but never plaintiffs. This applies to a Christian's personal affairs. As citizens of a state, however, we have the right to enjoy the freedom guaranteed by the constitution. Christians can enjoy the same freedom as others. If a school forces girls to cut their hair, the parents can sue the school, and we can help the parents in their fight against the schools. It is the freedom of individual citizens to keep their hair. There is no law that says that a person cannot be a citizen of the Republic of China if he or she keeps long hair. A school principal cannot say that a girl can no longer be a student if she has long hair. This is a matter of personal liberty. If someone asks me to intervene in this matter, I will. Nevertheless, we have to be proper in our attitude. We may invite those for a meal, go to the court together, and then drive them home afterward. In such matters we should be free from personal feelings. We are here to fight for the truth only. If the post office writes a letter saying that they will not deliver Bibles, we can invite the postmaster to a meal and still sue him. A Christian can fight for his right under the constitution. Yet we are fighting for the truth, not for personal conflicts.</p><p>In territories occupied by the Communists, some members of the party confiscate property and possessions and distribute them to others. If a Christian receives such distributed goods, he has no choice but to keep them. But when the situation changes, he can inform the original owners to come and retrieve their goods.</p><p>It is more serious for a school to demand its girl students to cut their hair than to cut their fingers. Cutting one's finger only involves individuals, but cutting the hair involves the truth and the Lord. If a sister is not clear about the truth and has cut her hair already, she should cover her head with a scarf. When her hair grows back, she can take the scarf off.</p><p>Question: Some time ago the church in Swatow excommunicated a co-worker. Was that right or wrong?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Concerning this matter I need to say a word to the brothers in Swatow. I have been in the work for over ten years. I have to apologize to the brothers with respect to a few things related to the excommunication of that co-worker. After that incident Swatow sent Brother Wen-kwang to Shanghai and asked us to excommunicate the same brother from the work. We were reluctant to assume the burden of others in our work, but this was wrong on our part. The real matter did not involve whether or not the brother should have been excommunicated. There was no question about the rightness or correctness of the act itself. Unfortunately, the church in Swatow was in the position of rebellion when it excommunicated him. The co-workers should have been the ones to excommunicate that co-worker from the work. It should not have been handled through the church in Swatow. When the brothers in Swatow executed the excommunication, it exposed them to a position more precarious than that of "The Lord rebuke you" in Jude. If the co-workers had handled the situation then, the issue of authority would not have been involved. I admit that I was wrong in leaving the brothers in Swatow in a quandary. I did not have the opportunity to make this matter clear before; I wish to take this opportunity today to make this clear.</p><p>The church's excommunication can only be applied to six kinds of people, as spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5. Others who are not clearly wrong in conduct, but who are wrong only in attitude or motive, should not be excommunicated, because there is no absolute standard for such things. The church can only exhort the various parties. If the parties choose to ignore the church, at the most the church can turn its head the other way and consider them as Gentiles. As for the case spoken of in Matthew 18, it involves offenses against individuals; it is an entirely different matter altogether.</p><p>Question: If a person commits an error with respect to submission to authority, can we point out his error to him?</p><p>Watchman Nee: If a person has never touched authority, it is useless to point out his error to him. For example, if you work in the Public Works Department and a few of your colleagues speak defiantly against their superior, it is useless to point out their error to them. They are unbelievers who are totally in the realm of rebellion. If you point out their error, at the most they will nod their heads; they will not change their heart. What use is it to do this? You must first help a person to see authority. Whether or not you point out the error is not that crucial. In pointing out others' error, you should be like one who is touching contamination and defilement. When such things come to you, you should recoil. You have to exercise extreme care in such things. You should not be sucked into the tide of rebellion and should not fall into the realm of rebellion. The basic problem with a rebellious person is that he has not seen authority. Suppose a man smokes. What use is it to help him merely stop smoking? He needs some basic dealings. He needs to touch authority. Miscellaneous dealings are not very effective. You have to bring a man face to face with authority. Only after you have done this can you say, "The way you just acted was wrong. Those few words amounted to rebellion." You have to learn to fear God. God is never loose with you in such matters.</p><p>Suppose a person is very lazy. He invites himself to this and that house for dinner but never takes up any job. You have to announce his name to the brothers and sisters and forbid anyone to invite him to their home. If you do this, you will stop his habitual ill. Some idle ones may criticize you, but in a nice way you can say, "Sorry, I do not have the time to listen to you." The problem today is that many people love to play politics. This makes the situation worse. There is so much gossip because so many like to hear such gossip.</p><p>We have to grow in faith and in love. We should rebuke the brothers and sisters who should be rebuked. The best way is, of course, to exhort them with love. At any rate, we should not play politics in dealing with the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Question: How should we muzzle a person who loves to speak and spread rumors?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Brother Miao made the best remark of his life when he said, "The ears are a trash can. No one throws good things like gold, silver, flour, or rice into a trash can." If anyone comes to you with gossip, you should say, "Sorry, my ears are not trash cans." They will have no choice but to take their trash elsewhere. Those who cause divisions should be marked out, and no one should have any communication with them. We should maintain our purity in our fellowship. If any word is to go out, we must first examine it and see if there is any element of rebellion or gossip in it. Much so-called fellowship among believers is actually gossip. We must quarantine all rebellions. Titus 3 says that we should refuse a factious man after a first and second admonition (v. 10). This refusal does not mean an open excommunication. It is a measure that aims at preserving the purity of fellowship. Many times measures taken among the brothers and sisters have nothing to do with love; they are a matter of dealing with infection. If a man speaks in a rebellious way, the best way to love him is to separate him from others. This is the greatest love one can give to him, because this will bring him profit and save others. Quarantine is exercised under the principle that it is an effort of recovery for the quarantined and a measure of prevention against infection for others.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ASSUMING AUTHORITY</h2><p>Those who truly possess authority never have to defend their authority. Nine out of ten persons are prone to touch men, not God. God may or may not have appointed one to be an authority, but it is always unsightly for a man to recommend himself as the authority. In 1 Corinthians the apostles were ranked first, but in 2 Corinthians the apostles were ranked last. In the first book the apostles were the first to be mentioned; this relates to truth. In the second book Paul said they were the last because there he was speaking on his own behalf. Both books are right. The Corinthians despised the apostle, and placed him, who should have been first, in the last place. Paul said that he was indeed the last. When he was attacked, he defended himself by saying that he was less than the least; yet he was not without grace. There are always two sides to every spiritual matter. It is equally wrong for an authority to expect submission from others and for a rebellious man to refuse to submit to him. If Brother Witness comes here, the brothers have to take care that he eats well. However, Brother Witness has to exercise care that he does not eat too well. If the brothers are concerned that Brother Witness is eating too well, they are probably not real brothers. However, if Brother Witness is afraid that he is not eating well enough, that is also wrong. We are here to uphold God's authority, not our own. We must touch the matter of authority before God. If a man only touches authority in man, the care he exercises will be nothing more than a sign of a weak conscience.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO TOUCH AUTHORITY IN A THOROUGH WAY</h2><p>I have said enough. Have we touched God's authority? Every one of us has to settle this question within himself. It is not important whether the policeman is called Chang or Hwang. As a citizen of the state we have seen that we must obey the police. If we are not subdued in this matter, we are useless. In covering the matter of authority, we cannot appoint one or two disobedient persons to go out and preach obedience. It is useless if we only touch men. If we have a craving for others to submit to us, we are still an outsider. I am not here to pass on some teachings about authority. I am not saying that we should take these teachings to others and subject them to our authority. We are for the humbling of our very person. We are concerned with whether or not we have touched authority. An authority is very tolerant of others' offenses. Christ was the greatest authority God ever appointed. Yet He experienced the greatest offense in the whole world. He was offended throughout His life. In the end He was crucified on the cross. Authority belongs to the Lord, not to us. The One who appoints authority is the Lord. If we can prostrate ourselves before God, all of our problems will go away. If we are still craving submission from others and are concerned only about upholding our own authority, we are far from seeing the reality of authority. We cannot be careless or loose in this matter. We have to be absolute. I will not let this matter slip by easily. We have to climb up a high mountain to see this matter. We have to uphold God's authority and testify to this authority. We should never consider how we can be an authority. Rather, we should learn submission and turn away from rebellion. We need to learn to drain out every drop of our rebellious blood. I hope that we will spend more time praying alone or in small groups. I hope that we will deal with this matter thoroughly. May we clearly see the principle of authority and submission as it is displayed in Christ. It is wonderful that we can learn authority and submission here! I pray that we will rise above the clouds and see everything clearly. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2><p>I have an additional word. First Corinthians 16:16 says, "You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring." Who are the "such ones"? We should look back at verse 15: "Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints." This means that anyone who has gone before us in the Lord should be an object of our submission. Concerning the house of Stephanas, the emphasis here is that they were given to minister to the saints. Although they might not have been that old, the believers should have submitted to them on account of their seniority. First Timothy 5:17 says, "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching." We should obey the elders who take the lead in the church. First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble." Those who are younger should be subject to the elders, and everyone should be subject one to another.</p></body></html>
