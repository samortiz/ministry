   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DEFINITION OF REGENERATION TO BE BEGOTTEN OF GOD AND TO HAVE GOD'S ETERNAL LIFE IN ADDITION TO MAN'S NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regeneration does not mean that "all the things of the past died yesterday and all the things henceforth are born today," as some may think.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nor is it a so-called daily self-renovation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regeneration is to be begotten of God John 1:13 and to have the life of God in addition to the natural life of man 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God begets us within, His life enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle Paul said, "It is no longer I who live" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our old "I" has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our baptism shows that we have also been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul also said that Christ, the One who died and rose from the dead, is our life Col 3:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are clear words from the Bible, and our Christian life can also testify to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why do we pray every day?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why do we have morning watch every day?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do these things so that we may draw near to the Lord and come before Him to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our calling on Him is our breathing of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He as the Spirit is like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we call on Him and pray to Him, we breathe Him in, and He enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all can testify that if in the morning we do not pray or call on Him, we feel empty and restless throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we call on Him, we have the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IV.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God also ordained that man, who was fallen and dead in sins, should be redeemed and regenerated Acts 11:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>V. THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REGENERATION THROUGH CHRIST'S RESURRECTION AND AT THE TIME OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regeneration was accomplished through Christ's resurrection and at the time of Christ's resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, it was not at the time of our believing that we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we were regenerated two thousand years ago when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God had already chosen and predestinated us, the believers, before the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the foundation of the world, when the heavens and the earth were not yet in existence, and before we were born, God chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then God used these thousands of years for us, His chosen ones, to be born into the environment He had appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we were born, God again arranged various circumstances and caused us to experience different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God created all kinds of environments in order to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>VI.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through this regeneration, God entered into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He lives with us and moves with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we speak, He speaks with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He lives in us as our life, and we are His living.</S>
