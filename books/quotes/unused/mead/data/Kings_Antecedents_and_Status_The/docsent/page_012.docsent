   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Judah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 1:2 also says, "Jacob begot Judah and his brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob's first son was Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Reuben should have had the first son's portion, which was the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The birthright included three elements: the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Reuben was the first son, he lost his birthright because of his defilement Gen 49:3-4; 1 Chron 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the double portion of the land went to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This must have been due to his purity Gen 39:7-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was the son closest to his father and the one most after his father's heart Gen 37:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each of Joseph's two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, received a portion of the land Joshua 16 and 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus through his two sons he inherited two portions of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The priesthood portion of the birthright went to Levi Deut 33:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Levi was very much after God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to fulfill God's desire, Levi forgot his parents, his brothers, and his children and only took care of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, he received the priesthood portion of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingship, another portion of the birthright, was given to Judah Gen 49:10; 1 Chron 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read Genesis, we find the reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Joseph was suffering under the conspiracy of his brothers, Judah took care of him Gen 37:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also took care of Benjamin in time of suffering Gen 43:8-9; 44:14-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of this, I believe, the kingship went to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we are the "church of the firstborn" Heb 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our birthright is also composed of these three elements: the double portion of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are in Christ, and we can enjoy Him in double portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are also priests and kings of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, many Christians have lost their birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have been saved and can never be lost, but they have lost their extra portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would enjoy the extra portion of Christ, we must keep our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All Christians have been reborn as priests Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But today many have lost their priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because they have lost their praying position, it is hard for them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would keep our priesthood, we must be like the Levites, and forget our father, our brothers, and our children and take care of God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's desire, not our families, must be first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God's desire has first pace in our hearts, then we shall be close to Him and keep the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All Christians are also reborn as kings Rev 5:10 , but many have lost their kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord Jesus returns, the overcoming saints will be with Him to be priests of God and co-kings of Christ Rev 20:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, they will enjoy the inheritance of this earth Rev 2:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 12:16-17 warns us not to lose our birthright as Esau did.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"For one meal" Esau "gave up his birthright."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later, he regretted that he had sold it so cheaply, but he was not able to get it back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have the position to possess the birthright and we have it already, but maintaining it depends on whether or not we keep ourselves from being profane or becoming defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Joseph inherited the double portion of land because of his purity; Levi obtained the priesthood because of his absolute separation unto the Lord; and Judah received the kingship because of his care for his suffering brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to keep ourselves pure for the extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ; we need to separate ourselves absolutely to the Lord with a heart caring for the Lord's desire above all things; we need to care lovingly for our suffering brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are like this, we shall surely keep our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even today we can enjoy Christ in a double measure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can pray, we can rule, and we can reign.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then, when the Lord Jesus returns, we shall be with Him enjoying the inheritance of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We shall be priests contacting God continually and kings reigning over the people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because Judah gained the kingship portion of the birthright, he brought forth the kingly Christ Gen 49:10 , Christ the Victor Rev 5:5; Gen 49:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"It is clearly evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah" Heb 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah are all associates of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have the life of these four generations Abraham's faith, Isaac's inheritance, Jacob's dealings, and Judah's care of love then we are the associates of Christ in His generation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>H. His Brethren</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When this genealogy mentions Isaac and Jacob, it does not say "and his brother"; only when it mentions Judah does it say "and his brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both Isaac's brother Ishmael and Jacob's brother Esau were rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But all eleven brothers of Judah were chosen; not one of them was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Judah and his eleven brothers became the fathers of the twelve tribes which formed the nation of Israel as God's chosen people for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, all Judah's brothers were related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For this reason, the genealogy of Christ also includes them.</S>
