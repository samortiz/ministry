At that time land was very expensive, and it was difficult to afford an adequate lot. The church needed property and prayed for it. In 1936 an elderly sister who was quite rich had some property very close to the meeting hall. This sister loved the Lord and attended most of the meetings. When she learned of the church's need for such a piece of property, she had the desire to offer that land to the church. At the same time, however, she was concerned for some of her children. Eventually, she decided to offer the property to the church for one-half of its value, which was between $25,000 and $30,000. Thus, the transaction was completed with the church paying half this amount, and the title deed being transferred to the church. While the plans were being drawn for the hall, that sister's daughter asked the church to include in the proposed meeting hall a stone with an inscription saying that the property for the building had been presented by the elderly sister for one-half its value. Brother Watchmen Nee absolutely refused to agree to this and quite a negotiation followed. Brother Nee did not give one inch. He would never surrender an inch to such a show of human glory. The daughter of that elderly sister likewise would not budge an inch. Eventually, the deal was cancelled, with the title deed being returned to the family and the money being returned to the church. From 1936 until 1948, the church in Shanghai was not able to acquire a piece of land for a building. This caused the church to suffer. However, it was worthwhile for the church to suffer in this manner in order to keep the principle of the reality of the kingdom life in the matter of giving.</P><P>By relating to you this incident from our past history, you can see where we stand, and you can see the reality of the kingdom life in the matter of giving. Never make a display of your giving. This is why we do not like to reveal the amount of money people have offered to the church. In some of the cathedrals and church buildings, there are inscriptions indicating who donated certain objects. For example, a bench may have an inscription declaring who contributed it. This is a shame! If it were not for the American system of taxation which allows for tax deductions on contributions, we would not permit the offerers to make their names known in any way. In all the years in China, where there was a different method of taxation, we did not allow the saints to use personal checks for the offering. Everyone used currency. Thus, no one knew where the offerings came from. This is a good practice because it closes the door to the flesh and human vainglory.</P><P>The children of the kingdom must also have an inward purity concerning prayer. Sometimes you may be tempted to want others to hear when you are praying. It is wonderful to shout, "O Lord Jesus! Jesus is Lord!" However, do not intend for others to know that you are praying. In a sense, it is better to hide your praying from others. Never make a display of your prayer life.</P><P>Concerning fasting, the Lord Jesus said that the Pharisees and hypocrites disfigured their faces when they fasted as if to say, "Look at me. I'm fasting." The Lord Jesus said, "When you fast, anoint your head and wash you face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting" (Matt. 6:17-18). Whether in the giving of alms, in prayer, or in fasting, you should never make a show of your good deeds.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_158.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_160.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kingdom &nbsp; pg 159</div><br></body></html>
