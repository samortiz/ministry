	 <h2 class="head2">Leading and Managing the Small Groups</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei of approximately six hundred saints has been formed into districts by joining fifty or so small groups together. If we want the condition of every small group to be the same, every saint to be equal, and every household to be alike, the co-workers need to advance this practice among the saints. The full-time co-workers are not here to lead the groups. They should exercise to advance the practice of the groups in every district. Every district probably needs four to six co-workers.</p>
<p>Before the full-time co-workers encourage the saints to be in the group meetings, there is a need for training. We now have saints who have consecrated themselves to serve full time. They can be compared to newly recruited soldiers who need training. We cannot arm newly recruited soldiers with rifles and send them off to war without training them. If they do not know how to hold their weapons properly, they will lose whatever battles they fight. Hence, we need to plan a training program so that we can train the saints, just as soldiers are trained. We need to train the saints in such things as how to use the Bible, how to speak the word, and how to care for people. All these matters require training. The church in Taipei has already been divided into more than four hundred small groups. These groups can be formed into eight districts of approximately fifty groups each. If every district should have four co-workers, we need at least thirty-two co-workers. These co-workers must serve full time; otherwise, they will not have the time to encourage the saints to practice the group meetings.</p>
<p>The full-time co-workers should bring &ldquo;business&rdquo; to the fifty small groups in a district. A co-worker can be compared to a manager who is over several stores. If the stores do not make a profit, it would be better for them to shut their doors. The full-time co-workers must bring &ldquo;business&rdquo; to the small groups.</p>
<p>Even though every group meeting is coordinated by the saints, if they do not know what to do when they come together, they will sit and look at one another. Someone may eventually suggest that they sing a hymn, but the saints do not know which hymn to sing. After two or three of such meetings, I am afraid that the coordinators will be absent from the meetings; the saints will not come, because they will feel that such meetings are a waste of time. For this reason, the co-workers need to give the saints &ldquo;business&rdquo; and help them run their meetings.</p>
<p>The co-workers can gather the six hundred saints and tell them what to do in a group meeting. We must encourage the saints not to worry but to invite people to the group meetings. We should tell them that we guarantee that everyone will be fed. Of course, we cannot merely say these things without keeping our promise. Every co-worker must prepare material to help the saints do business. For this reason, it is a great responsibility to form the small groups. The co-workers should train the full-time serving ones by having them serve with them. The co-workers can be compared to leaders in an army, who lead the soldiers in their squads. The squad leaders must take the lead to do things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging the Service of the Small Groups</h2>
<p>The co-workers who help the small groups in the districts should encourage all the saints until every household is preaching the gospel and every saint is serving and functioning. This type of encouraging requires some ability. If after one year of serving a co-worker is unable to help the saints in this way, we should consider whether or not he should continue to serve full time.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s society, people who work for corporations must be competitive and do their best to improve; otherwise, they will not have a future. Even preachers hired in denominations are under a contract system. Those who are employed by contract must produce results; otherwise, when their contract expires, their employer will not hire them again. The full-timers among us should not think that they have a secure job or that they do not need to improve. This is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Doctors in America must take an exam at least once every two years. Even if they have their own clinics, they still have to take an exam. If they do not pass, they lose their license. Even if they have been practicing medicine for more than twenty-five years, they must still take an exam. This is because medicine in America is improving daily. One&rsquo;s experience is not the sole basis of his qualification. Even a doctor who graduates from a famous medical school must keep up with the advances in medicine. Furthermore, numerous government agencies in America hold examinations for their employees every few years. If an employee cannot pass the examination, he will not get a promotion, and he might even lose his job. Therefore, the ones preparing to serve full time must be trained, and after they have served for some time, they should be tested. They will be tested on their performance in the training and on the effectiveness and result of their service.</p>
<p>Some saints might ask whether it is scriptural to do such things and whether Paul ever gave Timothy a test. Several verses indicate that Paul expected those who served with him to be effective (1 Tim. 3:15; 4:15; 6:14, 20; 2 Tim. 2:2-7; 3:10, 14). On one hand, we need to be trained, and on the other hand, we need some testing. People should not need to feel a whip before they make progress. There are many things for the full-timers to do. Two to three hundred full-timers might not be enough to encourage the saints who meet regularly in the church in Taipei to function.</p>
