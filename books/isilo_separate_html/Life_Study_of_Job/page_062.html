BILDAD'S CONCLUDING WORD</H2><P>Chapter twenty-five is a record of Bildad's concluding word. His final word was brief. From his previous speakings Bildad might have learned the lesson that the way to lose the case and to appear foolish is to speak too much. This might have been the reason that his concluding word was so short.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Saying That God Has Dominion</H2><P>First, Bildad said that dominion and power are with God, and He makes peace in high places (v. 2). Then Bildad asked if there was any number to God's armies, and if there are any upon whom His light does not arise (v. 3). Bildad's word here was not according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Nevertheless, like Job, he was showing off.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Saying That No One<br>Can Be Righteous before God</H2><P>In verses 4 through 6 Bildad returned to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Bildad asked how a man can be righteous before God, how a person born of a woman can be pure. Concluding that this is impossible, he said, "Behold, even the moon has no brightness,/And the stars are not pure in His eyes./How much less a man, a maggot;/And the son of man, a worm!" (vv. 5-6). This was the last word of Bildad in the book of Job.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
