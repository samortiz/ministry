   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF THE MINISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The exercise of a minister's spirit is something that demands his life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has to put his life on the line.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a person serves as a minister of the word, he must not only have a useful spirit, but he must be willing to sacrifice and expend his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every time a person serves as a minister of the word and ministers the word to others, he has to exercise his spirit by pouring out his life, just as the Lord Jesus did when He poured out His life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The night the Lord prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, He said to the disciples, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With the disciples, there was only willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the Lord Jesus, there was not only willingness in His spirit but a readiness to pour out His life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the reason His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground Luke 22:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, one's spirit is exercised by the pouring out of his very life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One has to exhaust all his energy, being spent to the point of experiencing spiritual fatigue and spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever the spirit is released, it challenges the weaknesses and death in others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a price involved in releasing the spirit in this way; it is a release of burden, a release that results in pain and fatigue.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The release of the spirit requires a sacrifice, whether in private talks or in public speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to release our spirit because many people are spiritually weak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our spirit has to be pushed to the forefront to confront these spiritual weaknesses and to destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must wrestle with these elements and pin them down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When our spirit is released, we will find that many people have spiritual death, spiritual coldness, spiritual stubbornness, and spiritual dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to push out our spirit in order to suppress and overcome their death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to transcend their death and swallow up their death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as we are filled with the word, we will see that those sitting before us are filled with darkness; they cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to release our spirit in a strong way, as if we are storming the stronghold of darkness and confronting the attack of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are preaching God's word on the one hand, and we are confronting the attack of the forces of darkness on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such death and darkness will try to swallow up our spiritual energy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we are standing before men, we have to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to overcome their darkness and break through their shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a work that requires sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is spiritually exhausting, and it demands a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While a minister of the word does not necessarily have to pay this high price every time, he must be willing to pay such a price.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to exercise the spirit in this way, a person must first have a proper functioning spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, one can only exercise his spirit to the extent that it has been trained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He cannot do anything beyond this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But whether or not he can even exercise his spirit to that extent depends on his willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes a person experiences great pressure before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he is willing to pay the price to break through, he will break through.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if he is not willing to pay a great price, he may choose to release his spirit in a common and easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not an easy thing for a minister of the word to stretch his spirit to the limit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man may exercise his spirit very much, but he may not be willing to stretch it to the ultimate limit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is spiritually exhausting for a brother to push his spirit to its limit or near to its limit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is, therefore, not unusual to find a minister who is reluctant to push himself to his limit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who do not know anything about paying the price for the release of the spirit will not know what I am speaking of here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man who realizes the burden that must be borne in releasing his spirit will know what I am speaking of.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A person who has never lifted two hundred pounds has no idea how heavy two hundred pounds are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only those who have lifted two hundred pounds know how much energy is needed to lift such a weight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever a person fulfills a spiritual ministry, whenever he exercises his spirit, he carries a burden that seems to demand all of his energy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the exercise of the spirit, the amount of one's willingness before the Lord is a controlling factor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man is willing, he can push the word out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more he is willing, the more strongly the word will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In speaking from the platform and in conversing with the brothers privately, the strength of the word that is released depends on the amount of the spirit that is pushed out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In serving others with the word, the spirit is under the minister's own control.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A minister can withhold the spirit, or he can release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As he is speaking, he can either make his message strong or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he is willing to sacrifice himself, he will strengthen the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he is not willing to sacrifice himself and is not willing to pay the price, he will make the meeting a common thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The decision to make a meeting strong or weak is in the hand of the minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For those who have never been trained, the work of the Holy Spirit is beyond one's grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For those who have received dealings from the Lord, and in whom the Lord has done a deep work, the result of a meeting is determined by the ministers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The amount of the Holy Spirit's work is determined by the amount of sacrifice the ministers pay.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are not afraid of exhaustion in a meeting, if we are not lazy, and if we are not affected by the audience or held back from paying the price or taking the dealings, we will release our spirit in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the word goes out, the spirit will go out as well, and the word will have a strong impact on others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we are exhausted, lazy, or reluctant to do anything, we can say the same thing in a hurried way, but our spirit will be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The words are the same and the speaking is the same, but the spirit will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Or it will be released only in a limited and weak way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Others will touch the word, but they will not touch the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will only hear the sound, but the words will not have any impact on them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The words may be accurate, but they will be weak.</S>
