Brother Hu Yi-min invited me to go with him last year, but my business and family entangled me, and I dared not agree rashly. However, I am very concerned about the work, and it seems as if I have already gone there. I am asking the Gospel Book Room to pass on X dollars for the gospel work in Yunnan. Please use it for the front lines. It is such a small amount that it can only show my support and oneness. (We have already sent it to K'un-ming to be forwarded to Yeh-Ji&mdash;Editor.) The region of Taichow in Chekiang is mountainous and close to the sea. Taichow, Ling-Hai, Huang-Yen, Hai-Men, Luh-Chiao, Hsien-Ju, and Tai-Ping all have many denominations. Tai-Ping has the most. The China Inland Mission constitutes eighty to ninety percent of the denominational churches. Each chapel has between one hundred and four hundred members. The work here has been mainly carried out by the local believers. Thank the Father for His grace. I came to Huang-Yen with Brother Shan Kai-fen on December 18. Brother Shan preached a few times in Shi-Ju-Dien Chapel and Jin Ching Harbor Chapel, but he did not speak the local dialect, so he went back to Shao-Shing before I did. I stayed and then went to Hai-Men. Brother Hwa Shi-bin and I held a five-day conference there. Brother Hwa Shi-bin then went to Shi-Tang-Tou in Tai-Ping to hold a conference there. I was invited to Yang-Fu-Miao to hold a conference for three days and then went to Pu-Jiao-Tou for five days. I arrived in Da-Fen today. I will hold a conference for five days and then another five-day conference in Lin-Hai. These dates are already set. I will let God Himself lead me as to the future. I have really seen God's own leading and blessing in the work in the past. May glory be to the Lord's holy name!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Hu Ji-tang</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I received the fifth issue of The Open Door. The number of pages in this last issue has increased, and they all told of the Father's blessings upon the work in all the places. I give much praise and thanks to the Lord, but I was also warned very much. I have been working with two Western missionaries, Mr. Milton and Mr. Mullen, at Hai-Men and Da-Fen. We have become more intimate with each other in acquaintance and in fellowship. I believe that many misunderstandings were cleared up. The work in Da-Fen was blessed by God much more than I expected. From there I went on to work in Lin-Hai for five days. Thank the Lord, several intellectuals and Buddhists came and were happy to hear the word, receive the Bible, and diligently search everything. How can an ignorant one such as I handle such work? May the glory and blessing go to our heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, amen. The Anglican Church in Lin-Hai wanted me to hold a conference there for seven days. However, I feel that if I work without stopping, it will not be good for either my spirit or my body. I reluctantly agreed to speak for three days, two messages a day. During these three days, my spirit was bound and my prayer could not get through. On the evening before the first meeting, I had a dark vision in my dream and intended to cancel the meetings. But the announcements were made. If I did not go, it would be unfaithfulness on my part. But if I went, I would feel quite unable to fulfill my task. I was in quite a bind. As a result, I failed in my work. However, God is my joy. I gained a good brother through these meetings, Brother Hsie Xiao-you, the principal of the Jing-Ai Elementary School. He has been reading the publications from the Gospel Book Room for many years. He also has The Open Door. He said he has been helped by reading The Christian and other publications. I will return to Shao-Shing tomorrow and tell you about my future plans later.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Hu Ji-tang<br />April 14, mailed from Pu-Ji Hospital, Lin-Hai</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_119.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_121.html">Next</a> </body></html>
