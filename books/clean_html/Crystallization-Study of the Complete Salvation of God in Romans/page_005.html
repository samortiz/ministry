<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Organic Salvation</H2><P>God's organic salvation is carried out by Christ's life (5:10b) and includes the following items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Regeneration</H2><P>Regeneration in Titus 3:5 refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God's new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Sanctification</H2><P>Sanctification (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16) involves not only a change in position; it involves a transformation in disposition, that is, a transformation from the natural disposition to a spiritual one by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturating all the inward parts of our being with God's nature of holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Renewing</H2><P>To be renewed (12:2b) means that a new element is wrought into our being. This produces an inward metabolic transformation, making us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Transformation</H2><P>Transformation is the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Conformation</H2><P>Conformation (8:29), the end result of transformation, includes the changing of our inward essence and nature and also the changing of our outward form, that we may match the glorified image of Christ, the God-man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Glorification</H2><P>Glorification (8:30) is the step in God's complete salvation in which God will completely saturate our body of sin, which is of death and is mortal (6:6; 7:24; 8:11), with the glory of His life and nature according to the principle of His regenerating our spirit through the Spirit. In this way He will transfigure our body, conforming it to the resurrected, glorious body of His Son (Phil. 3:21). This is the ultimate step in God's complete salvation, wherein God obtains a full expression, which will ultimately be manifested in the New Jerusalem in the coming age.</P>
