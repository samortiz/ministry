<h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE ONE ACCORD<br />
BY PRAYER, THE SPIRIT, AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>Instead of using our hall to establish a school or as some kind of center to take care of children, we need to spend our time on the Word and to contact people. There are thousands of Chinese families in many major cities in the United States who would be open to our visitation. Even though many brothers have a job, they can still use their evenings and weekends to visit these families door to door. To go to visit them in prayer by being prepared with the holy Word and filled with the Spirit will be very prevailing. To use the church meeting hall for a school or as a center to care for children will bring a lot of complications to the hall. The children will have to be controlled, a playground will have to be prepared for them, and a substantial amount of the day will be occupied by them in which the hall will not be free for the church&rsquo;s purpose. All the churches should use every inch of the hall for studying the Word and for prayer to receive the Spirit to bring people to the hall that they may get saved.</p>
<p>To maintain the one accord we must take one way for our driving. If we have different ways to drive surely our one accord will be somewhat damaged. In the New Testament there is only this one unique way constituted with these three substances&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Apparently, to use the hall as a place to care for children is not something distracting or making division. But after a while, some saints who have given quite much will not agree with the hall being used for that purpose. It may also be that some of the elders may feel to have a meeting during a time which has already been designated for the purpose of the children. We all have to try to do everything that would not bring in this kind of dissenting effect or thought. Whatever you do by prayer, whatever you do to get the Spirit, and whatever you do to take the Word, no one would dissent with.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother would propose that we use a certain kind of music to preach the gospel. Some may feel good about this but others may not. No one, however, would have different opinions concerning prayer, concerning the Spirit, and concerning taking the Word and preaching the Word. This is the unique way everybody knows because this is God&rsquo;s ordained way. This is not the way I invented or taught, but the way God invented and ordained in the Bible. We need to take this principle in all our practices. Try the best to always limit and restrict your practice by the Word. Whatever the Word does not say, it is better not to take. To preach the gospel by any way other than prayer, the Spirit, and the Word may cause some different thinking.</p>
<p>People would take another way because they do not want to spend that much time in the Word. To take other ways besides prayer, the Word, and the Spirit are short-cut ways for the sake of convenience. We cannot be entirely successful by taking a short-cut way. The genuine way, the proper way, the most profitable way to take is the unique way. The unique way in doing anything is God&rsquo;s ordained principle. The entire universe is full of principles set up by God, the Creator. If you are going to be married, you must take God&rsquo;s ordained way with the principle of marriage of one husband and one wife (Matt. 19:3-9). If you take a short-cut way, you will get in trouble. In our world and in the universe there are many God-ordained principles. Science actually discovers all these God-ordained principles.</p>
<p>To use other ways to preach the gospel or to carry the church on might be profitable, but that is the short-cut way. The short-cut way will always have some side effects. Only the proper way will never have any side effects. The best medical doctors are careful not to release any medicine that may have harmful side effects. Therefore, we should not use anything other than prayer, the Word, and the Spirit to carry on the gospel or the church life. Otherwise, we should be prepared for some side effects like dissension, which will damage the real one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOILING IN THE WORD, LABORING IN PRAYER,<br />
AND BEING DILIGENT IN DEALING<br />
WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It may seem very awkward to take the genuine way. It takes time and patience; we have to labor and toil. Let us toil in the Word, labor in prayer, and be diligent in dealing with the Holy Spirit. This is worthwhile. We have to spend much time to get into the Word; we have to get ourselves saturated, constituted, and even soaked with the holy Word. We must also get ourselves constituted with our contact with the Lord. We have to contact Him day by day and hour after hour; then we will be the right person.</p>
<p>In 1958 I went to the Cow Palace in San Francisco to listen to Billy Graham&rsquo;s preaching. Some told me that Dr. Graham spent much of his time on his knees praying. That was the source of his impact. I admired the way he applied the Word to the present world situation in his preaching. If he had not had an adequate knowledge of the Word and had not spent an adequate amount of time in studying the Word, he could never have applied the Word so adequately and soberly to the present world situation. We all have to spend time in the holy Word.</p>
<p>If you are burdened to preach the gospel, you must get into the Word and be one who knows the Word. A person may be a manager of a bank or a college professor, but he still has to spend time in the Word. A professor may know a lot, but God is not asking him to present his studies to people. For you to go out to contact people, you need to know the holy Word. Then use all your available time to pray to contact the living Lord.</p>
