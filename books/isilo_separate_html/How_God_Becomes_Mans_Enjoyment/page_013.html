<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE CENTER AND<br />
THE CONTENT OF THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to give Himself to us for our enjoyment. Hence, He must be in the Word; otherwise, we would have no way to contact Him. The center and the content of the Word of God are Jesus Christ His Son. All the words that God has spoken have Christ as their center and the content.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING THE EXPLANATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Bible is the Word of God, and it is the explanation of Christ. The Lord Jesus said in John 5:39, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures,...and it is these that testify concerning Me.&rdquo; The function of the Bible is to testify concerning Christ. The Bible testifies concerning who Christ is, what is in Him, His being and His power, what He has done, what He will do, and what He wants us to receive.</p>
<p>Luke 24:27 says, &ldquo;Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&rdquo; Verse 44 says, &ldquo;He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.&rdquo; The Lord spoke these words when He appeared to His disciples after His resurrection. The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms are the three sections of the Old Testament, that is, &ldquo;all the Scriptures&rdquo; in verse 27. This is the way that Jewish rabbis classify the sections of the Old Testament. The Lord said that the three major sections of the Old Testament speak concerning Him and must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Verse 45 says that the Lord opened the minds of His disciples to understand the Scriptures. This shows that the Lord must open our mind in order for us to understand the Scriptures. Without Christ, we cannot understand the Scriptures. He is the key to the Scriptures. In other words, Christ is the only key that can open the Scriptures, because He is the center and the content of the Scriptures.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING GOD BECOMING EVERYTHING TO MAN</h2>
<p>On the one hand, the Christ who is the center and the content of the Scriptures is God. On the other hand, He is not only God, but He is God becoming everything to man. There is a difference between cooked rice and raw rice. Cooked rice is raw rice that has been boiled and is ready to be eaten. Before rice is cooked, it is still rice, but after it is boiled, it becomes cooked rice. This is the distinction between God and Christ. God can be likened to raw rice, and Christ can be likened to cooked rice. If God did not want us to eat Him, there would not be the need for Him to be embodied in Christ, just as raw rice would not need to be boiled if it were not for us to eat. After rice has been boiled and cooked, the raw rice cannot be found apart from the cooked rice. Thus, John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This means that we cannot find God apart from Christ, just as when raw rice is boiled, we cannot find raw rice apart from cooked rice. Christ is God becoming our food, our &ldquo;cooked rice.&rdquo; If raw rice were not for us to eat, it would not need to be cooked. Likewise, if God were not for our enjoyment, He would not need to become the man Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Jews and Christians worship the same God, but there is a difference: Jews worship God apart from Christ, and Christians worship God in Christ. If we use our illustration, Jews eat raw rice, but Christians eat cooked rice. Although Jews worship the true, unique God who created the universe, they worship Him apart from Christ. Jews do not worship idols; they worship Jehovah, the Lord God who created heaven and earth and who is also the God of Abraham. Jews worship God apart from Christ. Christians also worship the unique, sovereign God of the universe, who is the God of Abraham, but they worship Him in Christ. We need to be clear concerning this difference.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that there is a God in the universe. Every human being must admit that there is a sovereign God in the universe. However, it is not easy for human beings to admit that the sovereign God is Jesus Christ. This is the difficulty we often encounter when we preach the gospel. The Jews, the chief priests, the scribes, and the Pharisees all believed in God when they crucified the Lord Jesus. The only charge they had against the Lord Jesus was that He called Himself God (Matt. 26:63-65; Mark 14:61-63; Luke 22:66-71). Even now, the Jews believe in God, but the God whom they believe in is not Christ. As a result, even though they believe in God, they cannot experience Him. God is objective to them, not subjective. In order for the objective God to become subjective to us, we must see that He is Christ. God is in Christ so that He can be our enjoyment. God must be in Christ in order for us to experience Him subjectively. Christ is God becoming everything to man.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
