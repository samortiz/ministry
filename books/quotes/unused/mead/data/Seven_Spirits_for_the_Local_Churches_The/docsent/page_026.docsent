   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WRONG ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We simply need to know how to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were taught to understand, to listen, and to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were taught to exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way, the Lord is not the Spirit but a set of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why today s Christianity is so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be assured that the Lord has turned the age from dead doctrines to the sevenfold living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all must learn to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us sing and praise Him and forget about our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must often say or sing, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! the more we breathe Him in. In the past we used the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We used the mind instead of the spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the past we did not worship God in our spirit, but in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the Lord wants to turn us from the mind to the spirit, from the doctrines to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So we all must learn how to exercise our spirit to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the right organ for us to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is life, and life is in the Spirit, and life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit is called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we touch the Spirit, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is just like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word for Spirit is pneuma, and this also means air.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the Lord is the heavenly, divine pneuma to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the air, the breath, and there is only one way to take in the breath to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we try to learn, to listen, or to understand the breath, we get nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is not Christianity; He is not a religion or a set of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the sevenfold Spirit, and as the Spirit He is the divine air, the heavenly breath for us to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>SAVED BY CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 5:10 says that we will be saved in the Lord s life, and Romans 10:13 says that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we put these two verses together, we see that we are saved by calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly, I thought that Romans 10:13 was only for the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since I had been saved already, I did not feel that I needed this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, we have been saved already, but in another sense, we still need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For instance, we still need to be saved from our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It may be a continual trouble to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How then can we be saved from our temper?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can be saved not by the Lord s death but by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can we be saved in the Lord s life?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is by O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the best secret to overcome our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Call!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must not think that our temper is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is so small, but it is so troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Can you say that you have not lost your temper within the past seven days?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am afraid that you cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So we must not think that our temper is insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is so practically troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But I have the secret of overcoming the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is just by saying, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever the little temper comes to bother you, do not try to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You cannot overcome it, but you can say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! and the temper is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Your temper is not lost but gone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Husbands and wives, parents, and children are the best helpers of the devil to stir up our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But whenever these dear ones are doing their best in this way, we must say from deep within, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just try it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not being superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible tells us in 2 Chronicles 20:22 that when the people began to praise the Lord, the Lord set ambushes for the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we praise the Lord by saying, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! the ambushes will be set.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Psalm 8:2 the word strength can also be rendered praise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>So it could be read in this way: Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established praise / Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord established strength with praise out of the mouths of the babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is this that silences the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It will not only defeat the enemy, but it will also shut the enemy s mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>So we must learn to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The secret to overcome all situations is to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You may say that you do not know the Lord s way for you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Just praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Lord, I do not know Your way; I do not know, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I do not know, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I simply do not know, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But You know, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you will praise the Lord in this way for fifteen minutes, you will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you feel lonely, do not try to pray by begging for the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Just say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In less than five minutes you will have the sense that the Lord is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You can get everything just by these four words: O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Sometimes it is even better to sing these words.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whatever you need, this praising will bring it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Poor Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They have complicated matters with so many teachings and spiritual philosophies to exercise the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>His way is so simple, so practical, so rich, so living, so refreshing, and so nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We could use hundreds of words to describe it!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should never look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are not good for praising.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Only Christ is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Look at Him!</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He is worthy!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Lamb is worthy to receive all the praises, glory, honor, and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>To praise in this way is not only food but also medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It not only nourishes; it also heals.</S>
