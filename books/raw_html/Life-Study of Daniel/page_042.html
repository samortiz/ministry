<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VISIONS OF THE OVERCOMING DANIEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE VISION CONCERNING THE FOUR BEASTS<br>OUT OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Dan. 7:9-10, 13-14, 26-27</H1><P>In this message we will consider further the vision in Daniel 7 concerning the four beasts out of the Mediterranean Sea. We have seen that these four beasts are dreadful and terrible, doing whatever they desire as if there were no God in the universe. However, this chapter reveals that the Ancient of Days is still on the throne.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD AND HIS UNIVERSAL DOMINION</H2><P>Daniel 7:9 and 10 speak of God and His universal dominion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Thrones Being Set<br>and the Ancient of Days Sitting Down</H2><P>Verse 9a says, "I watched / Until thrones were set, / And the Ancient of Days sat down. / His clothing was like white snow, / And the hair of His head was like pure wool." This signifies that God is ancient.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. His Throne Being Flames of Fire</H2><P>His throne was flames of fire; its wheels were burning fire; and a stream of fire issued forth and came out from before Him (vv. 9b-10a). Everything around Him is fire, meaning that God is absolutely righteous and altogether holy. Without holiness no one can see the Lord or contact Him (Heb. 12:14).</P>
