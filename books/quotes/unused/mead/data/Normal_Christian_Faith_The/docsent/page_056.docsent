   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every religion makes some contribution to the well-being of society.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every one of them has a point in common: giving man something or bringing man towards some goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the methods they employ may be different and what they offer may vary, all of them have something to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Believing in Christ naturally involves receiving something from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we want to see what Christ offers to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THAT MAN MAY RECEIVE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we are about to see are not the contributions made by Christianity to nations, governments, the world, and society at large.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We want to study a more basic, crucial, and practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What Christ gives to man is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we believe into Him we receive regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to admit that regeneration is a big subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can only take a general glance at its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you read through the Bible carefully, you will discover that it emphasizes life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In numerous passages it alludes to life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On this earth there are many kinds of life with many different expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every life has its own unique expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can identify a life by its distinctive expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE EXPRESSIONS OF DIFFERENT LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Take for example a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You know that it has life because it is living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You can also identify the distinctive expression of this bird.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is this expression?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even a child knows that a bird can fly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flying of a bird is the distinctive expression of its life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is such a uniqueness with the bird's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When this unique trait is manifested, it expresses itself in flying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again look at a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only does the fish have life, but it expresses the characteristics of its life by swimming in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we compare the fish with the bird, we can see that though both have life, the expressions of their individual lives are different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A bird can only fly; it cannot swim.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A fish, on the other hand, can only do the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is impossible for a bird to swim, even if you try your best to teach it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same manner, there is no way that you can teach a fish to fly in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Different lives have different expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The characteristics each displays allow us to identify them as different lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the mode of living is determined by the life it possesses, the question of life has nothing to do with learning and imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the lives are different, there is no way to change one into another by a learning process.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only possibility is to have a change of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the life is changed, the expression of it will also change.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the life remains the same, it is impossible to alter the expression.</S>
