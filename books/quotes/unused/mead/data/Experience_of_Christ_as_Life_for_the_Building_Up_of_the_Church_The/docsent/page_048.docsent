   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Old Testament gives us the pictures, whereas the New Testament gives us the definition and description of these pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the picture of the ingredients of the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The olive oil is the base, and it is mixed, blended, and compounded with four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Olive Oil</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Olive oil, according to typology, signifies the Spirit of God Isa 61:1; Heb 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Myrrh</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All good Bible students and teachers recognize that myrrh is a type of the death of Christ with all the sufferings which Christ passed through in His death.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Myrrh comes from an aromatic tree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This tree drops its juice either as the result of being cut or through some kind of natural opening or incision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It smells sweet but tastes bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we smell Christ's death, but He tasted death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ tasted death for us and its taste was bitter, but to us His death smells sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Myrrh signifies the suffering death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cinnamon</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fragrant cinnamon is extracted from the inner part of the bark of a certain tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It not only has a distinctive flavor but also can be used to stimulate a weak heart.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Calamus</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third spice is calamus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Calamus is a reed which grows and rises up out of a marsh or a muddy place.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These four spices were added into the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the death of Christ with its sweetness and effectiveness and the resurrection of Christ with its power were added to and compounded with the Spirit of God.</S>
