   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEACHING AND PREACHING CHRIST AS THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to ask what they did in their home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 5:42 tells us clearly that they taught and they preached.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What did they teach?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you believe that they taught the Ten Commandments or something concerning God s creation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Did they preach and teach something from the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Peter s first speaking, he did a lot of quoting from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They might have learned from Peter to quote something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 5:42 tells us that they taught and preached Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Himself, the Person, with all that He had done was the gospel preached by them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was a real move by the Spirit among all the new converts in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE OF AQUILA AND PRISCILLA In Rome</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Following the book of Acts, Romans 16:5 refers to the meeting of the church in Aquila and Priscilla s house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church in their house was the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young, I thought that the church in Rome was very big.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that the church in Rome met in Aquila and Priscilla s house, however, indicates that the membership, the size, of the church in Rome was not big but small.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Aquila and Priscilla were not wealthy, upper-class people because they were tentmakers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tentmakers in Rome could not afford a big mansion that could hold one or two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many churches in the United States that have over one hundred saints, but I do not believe the church in Rome was over one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How could one hundred meet in one home?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The saints in Rome probably had frequent home meetings in the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Ephesus</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1 Corinthians 16:19 we again see the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the church in Ephesus also met in their home when they lived there Acts 18:18-19, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I was young, I considered that the church in Ephesus was big, based upon the record in Acts 19 that many were saved and based upon the fact that the Lord mentioned Ephesus first among the churches in Revelation 2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I never considered that it was in Aquila s home.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament reveals to us that the way the early believers took for their meetings was the home gathering way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE OF NYMPHAS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Colossians 4:15-16 says, Greet the brothers in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church in the house of Nymphas was the local church in Laodicea, meeting in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The dissenters argued with us that there were two churches in Laodicea one in the home of Nymphas and the church of the Laodiceans elsewhere in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Brother Nee stressed that the very church in the house of Nymphas was the church of the Laodiceans see Further Talks on the Church Life, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>35-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these two verses one church is mentioned twice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church at Laodicea met in the house of Nymphas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CHURCH IN THE HOUSE OF PHILEMON</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Philemon 2 Paul refers to the church in the house of Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Philemon lived in Colosse v. 2 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Col 4:17; v. 10 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Col 1:2; 4:9 , and according to history was an elder of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It should be that the church in Colosse met in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, it was the church in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the church in Colosse, the church in Rome, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Laodicea all were meeting in some homes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE BASIC WAY FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MEET</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This should prove to us that meeting in the homes was a custom and became a habit in the early days of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Based upon this, we can see that the basic way for the believers to meet is in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in Jerusalem had a large number of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first three thousand were added and soon another five thousand were added Acts 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After this, Acts tells us that in Jerusalem believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Surely the church in Jerusalem could not build a hall, and eventually they were not allowed to meet in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then where did they meet?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In homes, from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should spread by the homes and in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you have the burden to spread the church to another area of the city, start meeting in the homes there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is better to start the church in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we were on mainland China, one church started in a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A group of medical students was saved and they had very little money and no house.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They wanted to break bread to remember the Lord, so they went to a Chinese cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In front of each of the tombs was a stone table for offering things to the ancestors of the deceased one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the brothers and sisters sat around that table before the tomb and had the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the regular way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nearly all the churches in China were started in some homes, not by renting a place or building a hall.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you start a church life around a stone table before a tomb, everybody functions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if you rent a building and set up chairs for a meeting, many are bound.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The room always changes the atmosphere of the gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we would meet in a great, crystal cathedral, I am afraid that I would not be able to utter a word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It would also be hard to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That kind of crystal cathedral atmosphere kills everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This kind of atmosphere may be good for a drama or a play, but not good for the church meetings for us to speak for the Lord and for us to open up our mouth to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes a hall may be too big for the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The best way is to go to a cemetery to have a home meeting started there.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then there would be no need to encourage everyone to function.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I assure you that everybody would function.</S>
