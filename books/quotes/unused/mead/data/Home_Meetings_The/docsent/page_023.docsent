   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY WORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to thank the Lord that on this earth, two great gifts have been given to humankind and to God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of these is the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this universe and on this earth, there is such a book which is called the Book, Bible is a Latin word that means the Book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the Book, the unique book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If today there were no Bible, the earth would be full of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is one of the greatest gifts of the Lord to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our God has also given us another gift, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus as the very God went through the wonderful processes of incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through all these wonderful, excellent processes He eventually did two things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, He breathed the Spirit of life into His disciples on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then He took another step to pour out the Spirit upon His disciples in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His resurrection He breathed the Spirit into us, and in His ascension He poured the Spirit upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that way He baptized all of us into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have the Bible, the Holy Scriptures, and the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are the two greatest gifts which we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we always neglect these two gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may have the Bible on our shelf or even in our pocket, but it has never gotten into us as it should have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, many times we grieve the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 4:30 says, And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word unto implies with a goal to reach.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the sealing is not once for all, but continuing, still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are still under this sealing all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is sealing us until we reach the goal of the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the real situation is that most of the time we care neither for the Holy Spirit nor for the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mainly we just care for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Christians we have been saved by the Lord, and we have been graced by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we are seeking after Him and we love Him, yet we mostly care for ourselves, not for the holy Word or for the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need a turn to care for these two gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to enjoy these two gifts hour after hour, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to pick up the word from the Bible until we have a rich deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then when we come to the meeting with such a deposit, at any time we can write a check for a hundred dollars, a thousand dollars, or even a million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you come to the meeting with a deposit of the living and rich word, surely the Spirit will distribute to you the deep word of wisdom and the rich word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way to keep such a deposit is by laboring on the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as we have no reason for not eating the physical food, regardless of how busy we may be, we have no reason for not taking the spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christians today are so weak, so poor, and so low just because of the spiritual famine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not eat the spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not pick up the Word regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even among us I still feel that there is such a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you mean business with the Lord for His recovery, and if you do love Him, you have to love His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus said clearly, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word John 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must take His Word daily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Learn to pick up the Word and gain a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then when you come to the meeting, it will be easy to receive some distribution from the Spirit, either the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way you will speak by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this you must have a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have many experiences along this line, because I speak so much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Recently, before a meeting I felt I had no choice but to pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The inner feeling told me that a little prayer would not be adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That would be like going to the gas station to get your tires pumped up, but leaving before the tires are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only so, when you come to the meeting, you must come with a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then while you are speaking, you will speak with a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While I am speaking, I am praying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am trusting in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe that while I am speaking, He is one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way you will spontaneously have the sensation, the assurance, that you are speaking the holy Word with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then you will have the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need this kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need the saints today to speak the living and rich word by a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then through this praying spirit, you will surely participate in the Spirit, who is your boldness.</S>
