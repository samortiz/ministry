   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW JERUSALEM IN HEBREWS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based upon this kind of understanding, let us read some more verses in the book of Hebrews concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Hebrews 12:18-21 we see some things in the background: For you have not come forward to a mountain which could be touched and which was set on fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind, and to the sound of a trumpet and to the voice of words, because of which those who heard entreated that no further word should be spoken to them; for they could not bear that which was being commanded: If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And so fearful was the sight, Moses said, I am full of fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We, the New Testament believers, have not come to these physical things a physical Mount Sinai, the sound of a trumpet and a physical voice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then verse 22 tells us that we have come to Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mount Zion is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse does not say we shall come to Mount Zion, but it says we have come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have come perfect tense to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mount s name is Zion and the city s name is heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have also come to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The myriads of angels are the universal gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have come to the church of the firstborn ones who have been enrolled in the heavens v. 23 . They are not in the heavens yet, but their names have been enrolled there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hebrews 12:23 also tells us that we have come to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirits of just men, who are the Old Testament saints, are in Paradise where Abraham is Luke 16:22, 23, 25, 26 and where the Lord Jesus and the saved thief went after they died on the cross Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 24 continues to say that we have also come to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are eight items mentioned in Hebrews 12:22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The things mentioned in verses 22-24 are heavenly or spiritual, in contrast with the earthly and physical things listed in verses 18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among these eight items is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the items referred to in verses 22-24 should not be taken in a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have never come to the physical blood of Jesus nor have we been sprinkled physically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one among us has ever come to the physical blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is another illustration to show us that we cannot understand the New Jerusalem in such a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as the blood in these verses cannot be understood in a physical sense, neither can the New Jerusalem in these verses be understood in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>None of us has ever come to the blood of Jesus in a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is also hard for us to locate the eight items in verses 22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirits of just men are in Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mount Zion is in the heavens; it cannot be interpreted in a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This discussion of these verses may help us to understand the Bible concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 11:14-16 says that Abraham and other Old Testament saints were expecting, were waiting, for a better country with a marvelous city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After considering these verses we must ask where Abraham is today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth Abraham had not entered into this better country with the marvelous city because in Luke 16 the Lord told us definitely that Abraham at that time was in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where, though, is Abraham after the Lord s resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some Christian teachers taught us that when the Lord resurrected from Hades, He brought the entire paradise a section of Hades to the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this kind of teaching, Abraham should have entered into heaven, entered into the better country and to the city that he expected.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At this point, we must read Hebrews 11:39: And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul wrote the book of Hebrews many years after the resurrection and the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By this time Abraham had still not obtained the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the traditional teaching, Abraham entered into the heavenly country and into the good city, but Hebrews 11:39 tells us that at least thirty years after the ascension Abraham had still not obtained the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some might say that this means Abraham entered into the country in the heavens but that the good city has not been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this is the case then where would Abraham stay?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Could it be that the Lord intended to finish millions of rooms in the heavenly mansion, but probably He only finished enough rooms to contain the Old Testament saints?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, according to the traditional teachings, the Lord in resurrection ascended to the heavens to build the mansion, and on the other hand, He moved Paradise to the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must ask then where He has located all the Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am illustrating this to show you how illogical and unscriptural the traditional teachings are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is leaven!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people take in the leaven without any consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I followed Brother Nee because he was the only person I saw who would not follow the traditional interpretations of the Bible which are illogical and unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the time Paul had written Hebrews 11, Abraham had still not obtained the promise, God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect v. 40 . God had something better in view concerning the New Testament believers, that apart from us the Old Testament saints, including Abraham, should not be made perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham is waiting to be perfected and he can never be perfected apart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that Abraham can never enter into that better country, into that marvelous city, apart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we will enter, he will enter and all the Old Testament saints will enter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Note 40 3 in Hebrews 11 says,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both the participation in the kingdom for one thousand years Rev 20:4, 6 and the sharing in the New Jerusalem for eternity Rev 21:2-3; 22:1-5 are corporate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The kingdom feast will be for the overcomers of both the Old and New Testaments Matt 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The blessed New Jerusalem will be composed of both the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers Rev 21:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, apart from the New Testament believers, the Old Testament believers cannot obtain what God promised.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To obtain and enjoy the good things of God s promise, they need the New Testament believers to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now they are waiting for us to go on that they may be made perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Old Testament saints are waiting for us to be perfected so that they may enjoy the New Jerusalem with us.</S>
