   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Not Living according to Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul continues, For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The you here certainly denotes saved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, this verse is further proof that a saved person may live according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we live according to flesh, we are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, this kind of dying is not physical; it is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you live according to flesh, you are about to die in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body that is, to mortify or crucify them you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that you will live in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse corresponds to verse 6 which says that the mind set on the flesh is death and that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To live according to flesh primarily means to set our mind upon the flesh, and, likewise, to set our mind upon the flesh mainly means to live according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to put to death the practices of the body we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Take the example of a sister going shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the store she sees a certain item which sells for 12.99.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sister reasons with herself, I make twelve hundred dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To spend 12.99 for clothes means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is not poor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Last week I gave two hundred and fifty dollars for the church building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is wrong with spending 12.99?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Certainly the Lord is gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more she reasons, the more she dies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While she is thinking this way, her spirit is suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She may try to comfort herself by saying, I shouldn t be so religious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There s nothing wrong with what I m doing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the more she tries to sustain her spirit, the lower it descends.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When she comes to the meeting all she can do is keep the form and strive to maintain the image of being a spiritual sister.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although she shouts, Hallelujah, it is lifeless and empty, a sign that she is dead in her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even though she suffers death in her spirit, she does not repent immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The following week she considers whether the article of clothing is still available.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, she purchases it and brings it home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At this point she is not only dead, her spirit has been put into a coffin and is ready for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As she comes to a meeting now she cannot even produce a formal hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She attends the meetings, but she sits there like a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One of the elders says to another, What happened to that sister?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two months ago she was so living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the matter now?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Does she have a problem with her marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not take a major problem such as a difficulty in marriage to put her into a box.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The small matter of purchasing an article of clothing for 12.99 killed her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She remains in that condition until one day, by the Lord s mercy, she repents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You need to examine your own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If when you think about a certain matter you have no rest in your spirit, stop your thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Call back your mind from the thing which gives your spirit unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever you try to reason and you feel empty in your spirit, stop and turn your mind back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You need to say, O Lord Jesus, rescue me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, deliver my mind from that consideration which gives me death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do this, immediately you will have rest, comfort, satisfaction, and even strengthening in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as you have rest, comfort, and satisfaction within, it is an indication that your mind is set in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you have no rest, comfort, or satisfaction, but rather feel dark, empty, and restless, it is an indication that your direction is toward death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such a case you need to turn your mind back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Romans 8 we find no teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are simply told to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can we walk according to spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By taking care of our mind, always setting it in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The mind should not be turned outward, but inward, not on shopping outwardly, but on the spirit inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you set your mind on the spirit, you will walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way we enjoy Christ and we participate fully in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Automatically and unconsciously we have the fulfillment of the righteous requirements of God s law v. 4 . Day by day we have the enjoyment of Christ as our fourfold life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All we need to do is to take care of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where is your mind?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In what direction is your mind?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to say, Lord, have mercy on me and grant me Your grace that I will always have my mind turned toward You and set upon my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By Putting to Death the Practices of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we have our mind set upon our spirit, our flesh will be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By setting our mind on our spirit we put to death all the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is to crucify the flesh Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we desire to go shopping, our feet may try to go, but our spirit says, Stay on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is mortifying, putting to death, or crucifying the deeds of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result, we will experience the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is to be had in the putting to death of the practices of the body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This does not happen once for all; it is a constant daily exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way to walk according to spirit v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The word walk includes our whole living what we say, what we do, and where we go.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we set our mind on our spirit continually, our entire walk will be according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We may call this the holy life, the victorious life, or the glorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whatever we may call it, it is the expression of the indwelling Christ as our fourfold life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the experience we need to have in the church life.</S>
