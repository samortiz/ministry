God has a purpose concerning man, which is clearly revealed in the Bible. The Bible is a book concerning God, especially concerning God&#8217;s relationship with man. In God&#8217;s relationship with man we can see that God has a heart&#8217;s desire and a purpose; that is, God wants to make Himself man and to make man God that the two-God and man-may become altogether the same. God is God, yet He made Himself a man and lived a human life exactly the same as man in the human nature and the human life. On the other hand, man is man, yet God wants to make man the same as He is, of the same kind and the same likeness as He is in life and in nature, except that we human beings have no share in His person. Thus, His attributes become our human virtues and His glorious image is expressed and lived out through us. Eventually, God and man become a matching pair in the universe. This couple look like man, yet actually they are God. This is truly mysterious to the uttermost. This is God&#8217;s highest and ultimate purpose in man.<h2 class=head1>THE STEPS GOD TOOK FOR THE CARRYING OUT OF HIS HIGHEST PURPOSE</h2><p>In order to accomplish His purpose, God already did three great things. The first thing is that God created man. He created man in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). God created man not in the image of the birds nor in the image of the beasts, but in the image of God. What God created was man, but what came out was God. Today, we are not only man; we are also God. We are man yet God. Likewise, today God is not only God; He is also man. He is God yet man. As a result, both God and man, both man and God, are completely alike and become a matching couple. How wonderful this is!<p>When God created man, He also created man with a spirit that man may contact Him. Since God is Spirit, those who worship Him must use their spirit (John 4:24). God created man outwardly in His image, and He created man inwardly with a spirit (Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1) that man might contact Him. After He created man, God put man in front of the tree of life and charged man not to eat of the other tree. If man ate of the other tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the result would be death (Gen. 2:16-17). This means that God&#8217;s intention was for man to eat of the tree of life and receive God as life. Man was created in the image of God and with a spirit to receive God and contact God as man&#8217;s life. However, instead of contacting God, man took in the tree of knowledge and thus became fallen.<p>The second thing that God did for man is that He Himself became a man. This took place four thousand years after He created man. How did He come? He entered into the womb of a virgin and was conceived there for nine months, and then He was born as a child. The Bible says that the child who was born in the manger was the mighty God (Isa. 9:6). He came to the earth, and in His life of more than thirty years He accomplished His mission and expressed God. Then He went to die on the cross. Through His death He accomplished an eternal, perfect, and all-inclusive redemption to solve all the problems and release Himself as the Spirit of life for man to receive.<p>The third great thing that God did is that through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). As God, He became a man to accomplish redemption. In resurrection, He further became the life-giving Spirit. This One, God who became man and man who became the Spirit of God, is our Savior, our God, our Christ. Today He is the life-giving Spirit waiting to be received by us. Once we receive Him, immediately He begins His dispensing of Himself into us.<p>Therefore, first, God created man in such a way that man had His image outwardly and had a spirit inwardly to contact and receive God. Second, God became a man and accomplished redemption to solve all the problems between God and man and release the divine life. Third, He became the life-giving Spirit. This is the Triune God in whom we believe today. When He enters into those who believe in Him, He dispenses Himself into them. How does He give Himself to us? When He as the life-giving Spirit comes into us, He is begotten in us. When He is born in us, we are regenerated to become another person, no longer the original person. Such a person is born of God and has the authority to be a child of God (John 1:12-13). Now we not only are created by God and have His image; we also are born of God. He Himself is born into us to be our life, our person, and our everything. He and we become one entity-God yet man, man yet God.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD THROUGH REGENERATION</h2><p>Unfortunately, many believers are not clear concerning regeneration. They consider regeneration &#8220;the turning over of a new leaf,&#8221; the changing of the past to make it something new. Actually, it is not so. Regeneration is God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into us, His being born into us. After we have been saved, we have another One, another Person, within us. We not only have another life but we have another One, another Person. This One is God yet man, and He is the Spirit, life, and everything. From the time of our regeneration God has been adding Himself gradually into us. When we were first saved and regenerated, God came in a little bit. Since then, whenever He has an opportunity, He adds Himself a bit more, and then another bit more, into us.<p>We can confirm this by our experience in our daily life. Before we were saved we had our disposition and personality. Everything we did was according to our preference, disposition, and personality. However, after we are saved, we have another One within us. When we conduct ourselves according to our former manner, this One within disagrees. He says, &#8220;You had better give up! Don&#8217;t be a husband anymore; don&#8217;t be a wife anymore; don&#8217;t be a father or mother anymore; and don&#8217;t be a son or daughter anymore. Let Me do it in you and with you. Not only do you not know how to do it, but even if you knew, you could not do it well. And even if you could do it well, I would not be pleased with it. Whatever you do, I do not want. I just want to be in you to do everything with you.&#8221;<p>I believe we all have this kind of experience. When we were newly saved, we were not so willing to allow God to do everything with us. However, over a long period of time, we become used to it. Today, when we live, it is &#8220;no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). Thus, more of God is added into us, and we become one who is God yet man, not only a new man but a God-man. This is regeneration.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD THROUGH RENEWING</h2><p>After our regeneration, He as the life-giving Spirit goes on to renew us within. Renewing does not mean that we have lived to be too old and therefore need to be renewed. Rather, renewing means this: Originally, we were the created old man. Although the old man had the image of God outwardly and had a spirit to contact God and receive God as life inwardly, he did not have any element of God within. Therefore, God became man to accomplish redemption and become a life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is now waiting for us to receive Him. When we believe in Him, He comes into us and is born in us. Thus, we become another person, a God-man.<p>Not only so, we still need to be renewed. With us, the most difficult thing to renew is our habits. Our habits are based mainly on our thinking. This is why the Bible tells us that when God comes to renew us, He first renews our thinking (Rom. 12:2a). Because we are occupied by our thoughts, God does not have much ground in us. As we regularly draw near to God and fellowship with the Lord, we have the sense that the Lord Jesus is somewhat unreasonable in us in that He always wants to occupy more room. But usually we are willing to receive Him only as a guest and do not want Him to interfere too much in us. I was also like this. I was saved when I was young. At that time I felt that I really loved the Lord, but I did not want Him to interfere with some of my affairs. I felt that the Lord was too meddlesome, that He should allow me to take care of some things myself. But the Lord said no. The Lord desires to continuously dispense the element of God&#8217;s life into our spirit through the Holy Spirit that all our inward parts, beginning from our spirit, may be renewed metabolically.<p>Romans 12 says clearly that we need to be renewed in our mind and then our whole being will be transformed. This renewing is not merely a renewing, but it adds more of the Lord Jesus, more of the Triune God, into us. What is the significance of being a Christian? To be a Christian simply means that our old man is regenerated by God to become a God-man of the new creation. From that day on, God continues to increase in us. Whatever we do, we need to remember that whereas formerly we lived by ourselves, now we no longer live alone, but God lives together with us. When we get married, we can no longer be alone. Likewise, now we have a Companion, who is the Lord-our Husband. The Lord should be our Husband; we should not be the husband. We should let Him increase in us day by day. When He increases, we are renewed; when He increases, we are transformed; when He increases, the result will be that we are completely transformed to become Him. He and we become one entity-God yet man and man yet God. Thus our old man is completely exterminated, and the world is also put aside by God. God changes our old man into a new man, and He also changes us into Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY RESULTING IN OUR BECOMING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2><p>It is in this way that God dispenses Himself into us. Brothers and sisters, it does not matter whether you are old or young, or whether you are a first-time hearer of my speaking. You should know that God has been dispensed into you. You have another Person in you; you are no longer by yourself. Never forget this: Now God is in you and He wants to increase in you and renew you day by day. Second Corinthians 4:16b says, &#8220;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&#8221; God is carrying out His renewing work in us daily. We are being renewed day by day. In other words, God is increasing in us daily. Although this time you have come to attend this conference for only two days, I hope that you will gain God unlimitedly so that when you return to your home what you will show people is not what messages you have heard but a definite growth of Christ in you and an increase of God in you.<p>In this conference we have a new hymn with four stanzas (using the tune of Hymns, #499), expressing God&#8217;s highest purpose concerning man. I hope that every one of you will sing this new hymn until it gets into your being.	<ol class="decimal">	<li>What miracle!

In this mingling God&#8217;s element increases more and more in man. When God&#8217;s element increases in man, man in the condition of the old creation will be gradually renewed and transformed until he becomes completely the new creation. What is the new creation? The new creation is just God Himself. In this universe, only God is &#8220;new&#8221; and everything else is &#8220;old.&#8221; Every person, thing, and matter in the universe is old and is becoming old every day. Only our God is &#8220;new&#8221;; He is ever new and never becomes old. Therefore, when we have this God, we become the new creation. God does not want us to change ourselves, to make ourselves new. God wants us to receive Him, be filled and saturated with Him, and be permeated by Him, that we may have a metabolic change.<p>Christians know and accept the matter of God becoming a man. However, concerning man becoming God, they consider this as something incredible. Some brothers and sisters might have heard and declared this, but within them they may have a question mark concerning it. What! Man becoming God? It seems that this is heresy. The revelation concerning man becoming God is unacceptable to many Christians. However, in church history, during the time of the church fathers, the truth concerning God becoming man that man may become God was generally accepted by the saints. But not long afterward the church was distracted from the vision concerning this truth and the economy of God and became more and more degraded. Hence, today when we speak about man becoming God, people generally feel uncomfortable with it and find it difficult to accept. Today our mind needs to be transformed by being renewed that we may see this truth revealed in the Bible. God became man that man may become God. What a miracle this is! What a mystery this is! Although our mind cannot comprehend it, we need to simply receive it, and then we will be able to enjoy and experience this fact as our reality.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS THROUGH REGENERATION</h2><p>God&#8217;s highest purpose is attained through the unlimited dispensing of the processed and consummated Triune God. He is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). In His dispensing, as the Father He regenerates us by dispensing His divine life and holy nature into us. After the dispensing through regeneration, He renews us through the Holy Spirit. Regeneration is the first step of dispensing. Originally, we were people without God&#8217;s life, but one day we heard the gospel and received the Lord Jesus into us by repenting and confessing our sins and calling on the name of the Lord. At the same time, the life of God the Father and His life element came into us through His dispensing. Christians like John 3:16. They pay much attention to phrases such as God so loved the world, His only begotten Son, every one who believes into Him, not perish, and have eternal life. Yet, they neglect the key word gave. The most mysterious, excellent, and marvelous thing about this verse is in the word gave. This giving is the dispensing of God the Father. When God the Father gives us the Son, He gives us, He dispenses into us, His divine life that we may be regenerated and become children of God.<p>Regeneration as the initiation of the divine dispensing has three issues. First, it causes the fallen old creation in Adam to become the new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). Second, it causes sinners as God&#8217;s enemies to become children of God (Rom. 5:10; John 1:12-13). Third, it causes the dead in Adam to become the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 12:5). Hallelujah! The old creation becomes the new creation; sinners who were enemies become children of God; and the dead become the organic Body of Christ. How wonderful this is! Before we were saved we were apparently alive, but we were actually dead. Outwardly, we seemed to be active, but inwardly we were full of death. However, once we are saved, we are no longer dead, nor are we individual living ones. Rather, we are the organic Body of Christ! This is the result brought in through regeneration.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS THROUGH RENEWING</h2><p>When the divine life enters into us, it not only regenerates us but also begins to renew us. Since God is &#8220;new,&#8221; renewing is the continuous adding of God Himself into us. This is the second step of the dispensing of God. At our regeneration, God enters into our spirit, so our spirit has the divine life. But we still have many troublesome things in us. First, our mind, emotion, and will are still in the old creation. Many of you came from faraway places to attend this conference, but when you go to see the Grand Canyon, you forget everything. Sometimes when we are busy on our jobs, dispensing, regeneration, and renewing seem to become unreal. Instead, the affairs of our daily life and our loans become very real. This is because our soul remains in the old creation.<p>After the dispensing in regeneration, we first need God to dispense His life element continuously into our spirit by the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5b; 2 Cor. 4:16b). Then, we need to be metabolically renewed in our inward parts, beginning from our mind (Rom. 12:2a). This is not an outward correction or change; it is a change in the inner essence, a metabolic, organic change. This renewing begins in our mind. Our thinking, our concepts, our logic, and our habits need to be renewed. The genuine Christians need to be renewed continuously. It is not a matter of how much you have been renewed, but of whether you are constantly being renewed. In the beginning you may feel that every day you are about the same. But after a period of time, by the change in your mind, people can detect that you are being renewed. If you have been renewed, people can sense that you have the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of God and you also have the spiritual understanding.<p>For the believers to be renewed, they need to have their inward parts joined to the Spirit in order to absorb the divine element distributed by the Spirit (Rom. 8:5-6). By ourselves we can never be renewed; we can be renewed only by being joined to the Spirit. The secret of being joined to the Spirit is first to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). If all day long we do not pray, it will be very difficult to be joined to the Spirit. But if we pray unceasingly, we are joined to the Spirit even if we pray wrongly. Once they are saved, Christians immediately have the authority and the faculty to pray. But unfortunately, because of the work of the enemy, today&#8217;s Christianity has nearly annulled the prayer faculty of the believers. I hope that we all are people who pray unceasingly. Even at the last breath of our human life we would still pray. Thus, when our breathing stops, our spirit is still joined to the Lord. How good this is! Prayer enables us to be joined to the Spirit and to absorb the Spirit that the divine element may spread within us.<p>In order to be renewed, the believers also need to walk according to the spirit in all things that their inward parts may be renewed by being saturated with the Spirit, until their entire being becomes a new creation that is fully organic (Rom. 8:4). To walk according to the spirit in all things requires us to pray unceasingly and to call on the name of the Lord constantly and in every place (1 Cor. 1:2). When you call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; the Lord will lead you in your daily walk and render great help to your family life and married life.<p>Therefore, the issue of being renewed is that the entire being of the believers is filled and saturated with the Spirit of life to be God&#8217;s spiritual new creation (Rom. 8:2). It is at this time that man is made God.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS IN REDEMPTION</h2><p>Following God the Father&#8217;s dispensing, there are Christ&#8217;s dispensing and the Spirit&#8217;s dispensing. Christ&#8217;s dispensing is in His redemption. Ephesians 1:7 says that in Christ we have redemption through His blood. Through His redemption Christ saves us into Himself that in Him we may experience His dispensing. Let us use the pearl as an illustration. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a pearl. Wounded by us in His death, Christ saves us into Himself so that by receiving the secretion of His life-juice we are made into precious pearls to constitute God&#8217;s precious inheritance (Eph. 1:11).<p>On one hand, God already loved us in eternity (v. 4), but on the other hand, we who were dead in our offenses and sins (2:1) were not worthy to be loved. A grain of sand is not worthy of love, but a treasure is worthy. We were unworthy to be loved, but by entering into Christ to receive His dispensing in redemption, we have become treasures worthy of God&#8217;s love and can be constituted as God&#8217;s precious inheritance. Hallelujah! This inheritance is a new man, a new creation.<p>Once we have become God&#8217;s precious inheritance, we take the lead in the whole universe to be headed up in Christ to restore the proper order in God&#8217;s creation (1:10). Because of man&#8217;s fall, the entire universe has become a heap of collapse, with all things in disarray. Furthermore, in the universe, the authority of God is being opposed and rebelled against. However, we believers have been redeemed to be God&#8217;s inheritance through Christ&#8217;s dispensing and are taking the lead to be headed up in Christ. This will restore the order in the entire universe. Today, rebellion is seen everywhere. Even a little mosquito is rebellious. Your dog often disobeys you, and your children even more. The grass does not listen to you but grows everywhere and has to be cut. In the schools, the students do not listen to the teachers. And even in the church, we often do not submit to the leadership of the elders. This is all due to a shortage of dispensing. The more we receive the dispensing, the more we can submit. As a result, the whole universe is gradually headed up. This is the goal of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS THROUGH SEALING</h2><p>After the dispensing of Christ the Son, there is the dispensing of the Spirit. The action and work of the Spirit&#8217;s dispensing in us is carried out through the Spirit&#8217;s sealing (Eph. 1:13) to strengthen the dispensing of God the Father and of Christ the Son. Sealing is a gentle and fine work of the Spirit. In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is likened to a gentle dove (Matt. 3:16). If you move a little, a dove will fly away. This indicates that the Holy Spirit is very gentle. In Luke 15 the Lord Jesus used the parable of a woman who sweeps the house and seeks carefully for a lost silver coin, to illustrate the Holy Spirit&#8217;s gentle and fine work in us. What the Holy Spirit does is to seal the believers in a gentle and fine way with the essence of the Triune God to saturate them until their body is redeemed (Eph. 4:30).<p>On one hand, the Holy Spirit is a seal in us to mark us out, and on the other hand, He is in us doing the work of anointing. The Spirit not only seals us but also anoints us. On one hand, the Spirit&#8217;s sealing with His anointing impresses the image of the Triune God upon us, and on the other hand, it soaks us and anoints all our inward parts with the essence of the Triune God as the ink. Hence, here we have the dispensing of the essence and the expression of the image. It is in this way that we experience the gentle and fine dispensing so that the essence of the Triune God, His attributes and virtues, His love, His light, His holiness, and His righteousness increase in us day by day. As a result, an image will be formed in us that we may be the expression of God. This is what the new hymn says: &#8220;His attributes my virtues are; / His glorious image shines through me.&#8221; This sealing results in our being filled and saturated with the Spirit.<p>Not only so, the divine essence with which the believers are sealed becomes the pledge, the guarantee, and the foretaste of God as the believers&#8217; inheritance (Eph. 1:14). In the dispensing of Christ we become God&#8217;s inheritance, but in the Spirit&#8217;s sealing God becomes our inheritance. We become God&#8217;s inheritance, and God becomes our inheritance. This is God becoming man and man becoming God. God becomes our inheritance through the Spirit as the pledge, the guarantee, and the foretaste in us. One day, at the completion of the sealing, our body will be redeemed. At that time our body will be exactly like God&#8217;s and will be completely filled with the divine essence. Today we are still in the process of being redeemed. Therefore, there is the need of a guarantee. This guarantee is the Spirit given to us by God. This Spirit is the guarantee and the foretaste. On that day we will have the full taste. Today we can have a foretaste of the redemption of our body through the sealing of the Spirit.<p>From Ephesians 4:25 Paul began to speak concerning the details of the believers&#8217; living. In verse 30 he mentioned again the sealing of the Spirit, which he had mentioned previously in chapter one, saying, &#8220;And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&#8221; This means that the gentle, detailed dispensing of the Holy Spirit takes place in the details of our daily life. Especially in our speaking and in our temper, we very much need to continuously experience the gentle, detailed dispensing of the Spirit in us. We have to admit that we often grieve the Spirit. With regard to our stubbornness and wrangling, the Holy Spirit does not fly away like a dove but remains in us grieving. Paul reminds us that we are those who have been sealed in Him. This means we have God&#8217;s image in us and thus are like God. Moreover, we have the essence of God sealing us within. Hence, we should not grieve the Holy Spirit, so that He may freely carry out His sealing within us until our body is redeemed.<p>Therefore, the way for our entire being to be conformed to His glorious image is to not grieve the Holy Spirit of God and to be joined to the Spirit all the time and to live and walk in the Spirit. We have the seal of God in us, so we need to walk by the Spirit, especially in relation to our speaking and our temper. Thus the gentle dispensing of the Spirit will continually move in us and seal us so that there will truly be glory in every part of us and God will be in us everywhere. God will be not only in our mind, emotion, and will, but even in our speaking, our move, and our actions, from our head to our feet. Hallelujah! This is the dispensing of the processed Divine Trinity in the believers.<p><p>M. C. substituting for W.

He is no longer merely the God in Genesis. Rather, He is a God who went through incarnation, who went through a sinless human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who went through death and resurrection, and who became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection. Furthermore, He ascended to the height of the heavens not only with divinity but also with humanity. He is man exalted and glorified in God to be made both Lord and Christ in the universe.<p>Such a processed Triune God today comes into us to be with us by our believing in Him and receiving Him. The Triune God&#8217;s being with us is to dispense Himself wholly and completely into us to regenerate us.<p>Many Christians know that God has come into them, yet they do not know what God is doing in them. They think that since God has regenerated them, He is doing nothing now but waiting in them until they go to heaven. However, if we read the entire New Testament we will discover that this God who is in us is busier today than when He was on the earth. When He was on the earth He only preached the gospel, taught the truth, opened the eyes of the blind, raised the dead, and trained the disciples. But today this Lord enters into millions of people to transform and renew every one of them. This is much more difficult than His work on the earth. It is rather easy for a person to change. All he needs to do is to change his clothing, get a haircut, adjust his behavior, and alter his accent. In this way he is altogether changed in appearance. However, transformation is not merely an outward change; it is a metabolic change in the inward essence and nature. Whereas the outward change can be accomplished by human work, the inward transformation must be a matter that is absolutely organic.<h2 class=head1>THE PRINCIPLE OF GOD IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>In general, people&#8217;s concept is to forsake evil and follow good. Because of the teachings of Confucius and the ancient sages, this concept is especially prevailing among the Chinese, who all aspire to be someone who is good, excellent, and even superior to all others. But this is a natural human concept; this is not a biblical concept, nor is it God&#8217;s teaching to us. The Bible says that after God created man, He put man in the garden of Eden in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:8-9). These two trees indicate two principles: one, the simple principle of life, and the other, the complicated principle of good and evil. Eventually, man took the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life; thus, he fell. After the fall, man became blind concerning the matter of life. In his thinking there is no longer any element of life; rather his thinking is full of the concept of the knowledge of good and evil. All day long human beings linger in the sphere, the realm, of the knowledge of good and evil, and all they care about is to forsake evil and follow good. We all know that even a robber has a heart to do good. For instance, in England there was a famous robber named Robin Hood. He considered himself a good man because he robbed the rich to help the poor for the carrying out of heavenly justice. But this kind of person is altogether ignorant concerning life.<p>Actually, the principle of forsaking evil and following good is a fallen principle. Unfortunately, even today&#8217;s Christianity has taken in this principle and has thus fallen into the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. They speak only about how to forsake evil and follow good, as Confucianism teaches. Therefore, when the western missionaries went to China with their Bible, they were looked down upon by the Chinese, who thought that the gospel simply taught people to love their wives and to love others as they love themselves, which is in no way superior to the principle of the great learning taught by Confucius and Mencius. Therefore, it was difficult for them to receive the gospel. Brothers and sisters, we need to be delivered out of this concept to reach God&#8217;s purpose. The principle of God is the principle of life, and the purpose of God is for man to have a change in life from within. Transformation is to change people in their essence to make them the new creation of God&#8217;s desire according to His divine essence. This is an inward, metabolic process. An outward change may make a person better or may make a person worse. But a person who undergoes a change in life cannot go back to his original form, just as a person who has been regenerated cannot become unregenerated. Perhaps after your regeneration you do not want the Lord anymore. But God, who has entered into you, will not leave you. God&#8217;s work in you can never be destroyed, and His dispensing can never be annulled. They will continue until you fully become God&#8217;s new creation.<p>The dispensing of the Triune God in us is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. First, there are the Father&#8217;s dispensing through regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3) and His dispensing through the renewing by the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). Then there is Christ the Son&#8217;s dispensing in His redemption (Eph. 1:7-12). Eventually, we have the Spirit&#8217;s dispensing through the sealing (v. 13). The issue of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity is transformation. What a miracle this is! The greatest miracle in the universe is not the healing of cancer. It is that we Christians, who were nothing but flesh in a great mess, full of filthiness, temper, and evil, after believing in the Lord, receiving the dispensing of the Triune God, and remaining in the church life, praying and calling on the name of the Lord day by day, after a period of time have a great change in our inner being, in our essence and in our constitution, so that we are no longer like what we were before. What a miracle this is in the universe! This kind of miracle takes place every day and every moment in the church of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING ISSUING IN TRANSFORMATION, AND TRANSFORMATION BEING THE BUILDING</h2><p>The divine dispensing issues in transformation. The more we receive the divine dispensing, the more we are being transformed. Hence, we all need to receive the dispensing before the Lord. This will bring us a rapid transformation. This is also why we need to have a daily morning revival. Morning revival brings us the divine dispensing of the Triune God that we may be transformed. Do not endeavor to improve yourself. The more you try, the more you fail. You need to behold the glory of the Lord every day through morning revival that you may be gradually transformed into the same glorious image of the Lord. It is not a matter of improving or of forsaking evil and following good. Rather, it is a matter of staying away from good and evil and following life, turning to the tree of life, enjoying the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God, and allowing Him to transform you from within. Thus, even if you are an incurable person, you can be transformed.<p>Transformation not only issues in the building but, actually, it is the building. How much we have been transformed determines how much building there is, because transformation itself equals building. The dispensing of the Divine Trinity first regenerates us and then renews us. Eventually, we have a metabolic transformation within us. This transformation is what we call building.<h2 class=head1>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><p>The dispensing of the processed Divine Trinity is of three aspects. The first aspect is the dispensing of the Father, who is the very source of the dispensing. God the Father dispenses His life and nature into us through regeneration and renewing. This is the foundation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Without regeneration and renewing we cannot experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in redemption and through sealing. Therefore, the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through regeneration and renewing is the foundation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.<p>The second aspect is the dispensing of the Son. The dispensing of Christ the Son is in His redemption. It is in redemption, that is, in the Beloved, that we experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in our inward parts. We cannot enter into another human being, but we can enter into the Lord Jesus Christ. The Scriptures say that when we believe in the Lord Jesus, we believe into Him. Generally, the Chinese hold the concept of &#8220;believing by relying or leaning upon&#8221; Him. To their way of thinking, it is as if we were drifting here and there, but one day we heard the gospel and realized that the Lord Jesus is One who is strong, stable, and rich, so we rely and lean upon Him as our Savior. However, before long we become so tired that we have no more strength to lean upon Him. In the Old Testament, Noah&#8217;s ark is a very good picture. Through the ark, which typifies the saving Christ, the entire household of Noah and all living things were rescued out of the flood waters of God&#8217;s judgment. During that flood it rained continuously for forty days. If Noah had merely leaned upon or hung on to the ark, there would have been no way for him to be saved. However, Noah entered into the ark and thus was saved. Therefore, although it rained for only forty days, even if it had rained for forty years, Noah would still have been very safe. Likewise, Christ is not for us to lean upon but for us to believe into. When we believe into Him, His rich grace, the washing of His precious blood, and the forgiveness of sins and trespasses all become our enjoyment. In Christ&#8217;s redemption the Father as the source continually supplies us with the element of the Son. It is as we said previously: Christ as the oyster that produces a pearl is wounded by us, a grain of sand, and by our remaining in His wound, He secretes His life element around us, imparting and supplying it to us continually. Eventually, He makes us precious pearls to be constituted into God&#8217;s treasure as God&#8217;s inheritance.<p>The third aspect of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity is the dispensing of the Spirit through sealing. This sealing seals us with the essence of the Triune God in a gentle and fine way. Hence, the Father dispenses His life and nature, the Son dispenses His element, and the Spirit dispenses His essence, with which He seals us. The dispensing in its three aspects thus becomes richer and richer and more and more gentle. First Thessalonians 5:19 says, &#8220;Do not quench the Spirit.&#8221; This indicates that the work of the Holy Spirit within us is very gentle and fine. We all need to live and walk in the sealing of the Spirit. For example, when someone apologizes to another person, his tone may not be suitable. This shows that his apology is not in the sealing of the Holy Spirit. If you apologize in the sealing of the Holy Spirit, even the time, the tone, and the facial expression of your speaking need to be carefully considered. If there is something wrong, the Holy Spirit is grieved in you. When you remain in the sealing of the Holy Spirit, you take Christ as your person; then when you live, it is no longer you but Christ. Thus the Spirit gently carries out the sealing in you, enabling you to live and walk in a proper manner and to be full of the anointing ointment and a sense of sweetness and gladness. This is the sealing of the Holy Spirit. In our daily life, He works within us day by day until one day our body will be redeemed. The redemption of our body is the result of the sealing of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>REMAINING IN THE DISPENSING FOR THE BUILDING</h2><p>Some believers may think that eventually at the Lord&#8217;s coming they will be raptured, so they disregard the Holy Spirit and neglect the dispensing of the Divine Trinity and live their life as they please. If this is your concept, you are dreaming. We need to know that the Lord will come to take the treasures, those who are precious in His eyes. If we are not transformed into precious pearls, we will not be raptured by the Lord. Even concerning the rapture, there are different categories. Only the rapture of the overcomers is the best rapture. If you live in the present age in a careless and loose manner, you will not be able to participate in the best rapture. However, if you allow the Holy Spirit to carry out His sealing in you day by day, to the extent that inwardly you have the transformation by the essence of God and outwardly you are conformed to His image, you will be raptured victoriously.<p>Not only so, in the church life and for the building we need to remain continually in the sealing of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes friction exists among the brothers and sisters because there is not the willingness to apologize to others. Sometimes when others offend you, you are constantly bothered and are unwilling to forgive them. If so, even though you may be able to praise the Lord in the meetings, the building of the church is damaged. Therefore, in the church life it is very necessary for the brothers and sisters to love one another and to forgive one another. We cannot do this by ourselves. It is only by the sealing of the Holy Spirit that we can have the built-up church life.<h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING OF GOD IN THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>By the dispensing of the processed Divine Trinity, God will be able to accomplish His purpose and work in us. Now we are waiting for the redemption of our body, that is, for the spreading of God&#8217;s essence into our body that our body of humiliation may be permeated with His element so that we will be exactly the same as God and will completely become God from the inside to the outside. Some people criticize us, saying, &#8220;How can we human beings be made God? This is heresy.&#8221; This is because they have not seen this vision. Ephesians 4:23-24 says, &#8220;And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&#8221; This indicates that this new man has not only the image of God outwardly but also the life and nature of God inwardly (Col. 3:10). Therefore, this new man is God. When we put on the new man, we put on God.<p>Not only so, 2 Corinthians 3:18 says that when we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, we are being transformed into the same image. This image is not the image of God with which man was created; it is the image of the resurrected, glorified, pneumatic Christ, to which the believers are being conformed by being transformed in their inward essence. Today this Christ is the processed Triune God. In other words, we are being conformed to God. Romans 8:29 says that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. One day we will all have the image of God&#8217;s Son; we will all fully become the sons of God. Surely the sons of God are God. Hence, 1 John 3:2 says, &#8220;Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be. We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is.&#8221;<p>If you read these few verses you will prostrate yourself and bow your head to worship the Lord, saying, &#8220;O God, yes, we can never share in Your Godhead to become an object for people to worship; but we thank You that in Your highest purpose, by the dispensing in regeneration, renewing, redemption, and sealing, You are transforming us to build Yourself into us that we may become exactly the same as You are, within and without, that we may become God. We worship You for this highest purpose of Yours.&#8221; If you have this kind of realization, your entire living will have a great change. You will no longer be going up and down continually in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. You will jump out of that realm and no longer try to be one who is good or one who is superior to all others. You will just be like God, express God, and have God&#8217;s image. This is the church, the Body of Christ.<p>The issue of the divine dispensing is transformation, which is the building. God&#8217;s building is to take Himself as the material and build Himself into His chosen and redeemed people. Some brothers and sisters have an incorrect concept, thinking that if they have compatible interests and the same opinion and serve together in coordination, they are built up together. That is not building. The genuine building is the Triune God building Himself into the believers through the transformation of the believers. Ephesians 3 presents us a picture of the apostle praying to God the Father that He would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened through the Holy Spirit that Christ may make His home in us. This is a picture of the dispensing of the Triune God. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; An abode is something that is built up. Hence, for the Triune God to make an abode in us is for Him to build Himself into us, that is, to build Himself with us together as a mutual dwelling place for Him and us.<p>Brothers and sisters, how much has God been built into you today? We might have believed in the Lord for a long time, yet we still might not have allowed the Triune God to dispense Himself sufficiently in us. As a result, many years have gone by, but we are still materials scattered in different places, and even the foundation has not been properly laid. If we are willing to receive more of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the element of God will increase in us day by day and there will be the building day by day. As a result, very soon God will have a dwelling place in us, a place where He can rest. God will be comfortable and restful in us because He will have obtained a dwelling place and He Himself will also have become our dwelling place.<p>This is not a doctrine; this should be our daily experience. This is the growth of life, and this is also the genuine spiritual growth, the real overcoming life. The Lord&#8217;s recovery, beginning with Brother Nee, has always been concerned with this building. What we need is not the outward material blessings nor the so-called spirituality or victory. What we need is Paul&#8217;s prayer in Ephesians 3, that is, that the Father would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts. We need to pray for one another and the church. We all need to be strengthened into our inner man that we may be joined to the Spirit, to the Triune God, to experience the continual dispensing of the Divine Trinity, with the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence (Eph. 4:4-6). This dispensing issues in the building of God in us. Thus, we and God, God and we, become a mutual dwelling place. First we dwell in Him, and then He dwells in us. Eventually, by our dwelling in Him and His dwelling in us, He and we become one; that is, God becomes man and man becomes God. This is the ultimate issue of the making of the abode in John 14-the New Jerusalem. In other words, this mutual dwelling of us in Him and Him in us issues in the New Jerusalem. Thank the Lord that today we are living in the reality of the New Jerusalem to build the Body of Christ for the New Jerusalem.<p><p>M. C. substituting for W.

First, I am sorry and I apologize to you, especially those who came from faraway places and have the desire to see me for some fellowship, but in the last few weeks most of the time I have been ill and have been resting, so I cannot comply with your request. I am truly regretful concerning this. Please forgive me. As to the messages, although I have not been able to fellowship with you all the messages from beginning to end, according to the news I received, I think that the one who substituted for me has done a better job than I would have. Therefore, this is proof that what we have is not one man&#8217;s individual ministry but a corporate ministry of the Body. I am weak temporarily, but other brothers can substitute for me. How pleasant and how good this is.<p>If you will allow me, I will sit down so that I can feel more relaxed. The burden of this conference is very mysterious, especially the main point on God becoming man and man becoming God. This is an economy that cannot be fathomed by angels and men; it is too high, too mysterious, and too mystical, even to the extent that we simply cannot believe that such a thing can happen in the universe. I sincerely hope that every brother and sister who is attending this conference will see this great vision. In the universe there are God, the heavens, the earth, and man. Of these four items, two-the heavens and the earth-are dead, without life, and two-God and man-are living. I hope that you all can see the story of God and man.<p>The six thousand years of human history show us that there are the teachings of religion, philosophy, and ethics; this is true throughout the world. Only the Lord gave us a Bible. In this Bible He shows us a great revelation, that is, that God wants to make Himself the same as man. Is this not wonderful? He is God, yet He took on human nature, put on a human body, and had a human life to dwell and live together with men in order to make men, His chosen people, the same as He is. Thus, although these men are human, they have His divine life and His divine nature. In life and nature, man and God are of the same kind. Eventually, He begot us, and we were born of Him. He is God and has our human nature; likewise, we are man and also have His divine nature. Hence, these two are God yet with humanity and are man yet with divinity. By these two natures and two lives God mingles Himself with man in order that His divine life may be lived out through humanity among men, and in order that His redeemed may have His divinity and in His divinity may live out the likeness of God through the resurrected and uplifted humanity.<p>Eventually, this will make God and man alike and mingled together and even built together. Through the steps that were just mentioned, God builds Himself into man and builds man into Himself. He Himself becomes this constitution with Himself as the intrinsic element-the source, element, and essence within-and with His redeemed people built together in the intrinsic element-the source, element, and essence- to become the framework. This is the one new man in the universe. This is what Ephesians 4 shows us. The ultimate consummation of this new man is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a constitution of God and man and man and God, who are constituted into one; it is divinity expressed in humanity and humanity glorified in divinity. Therefore, they two-divinity and humanity-become a mutual dwelling place. The One who is God yet man dwells in the one who is man yet God, and the one who is man yet God dwells in the One who is God yet man. They are a mutual dwelling place. Thus, His divine glory shines forth radiantly with great splendor in humanity. There is not one bit of good or evil here, and it has nothing to do with good and evil. God&#8217;s economy is absolutely outside of good and evil. This economy is God and man becoming one entity, as one who is God yet man and man yet God.<p>Brothers and sisters, you are all blessed to be able to see this. This is a tremendous blessing. May the Lord fully rescue you and me out of religion, philosophy, and human ethics into this great vision of God becoming man and man becoming God. It is here that the Lord can have the saints as the members of Christ, the church as the Body of Christ, and the constitution of God-yet-man and man-yet-God as the one new man. Eventually, in the universe the divine glory as the eternal expression of God will be manifested brightly in man. I truly hope that all of you will see this, and I pray that God will bless you with His limitless blessings and grace you with His boundless grace, and that He may grant you His eternal presence that you may enjoy this and bear testimony of this. Again I say, brothers and sisters, may the Lord bless you and be with you.<p><p>W. L.</body></html>
