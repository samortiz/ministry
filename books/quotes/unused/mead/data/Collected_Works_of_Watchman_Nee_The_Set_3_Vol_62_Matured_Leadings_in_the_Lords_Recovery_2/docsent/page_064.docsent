   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The schools and the occupations of all the brothers and sisters should be related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to bring the gospel to a campus from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But it is easy if some preach the gospel within the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Taichung, Taiwan, one state-run agricultural school had only a few brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In less than half a year, the number increased to twenty or thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Outwardly, the brothers and sisters were studying in that school.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, they were there for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Like Paul, we must be persons who are full of gospel germs Acts 24:5; 26:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gospel has to spread out through us and infect others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same can be said about our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who hold some kind of occupation must be clear that their real occupation is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AN ADDITIONAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Watchman Nee: I have only a little to add to what was already said.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning all the services, the responsible brothers and sisters must start discussing, fellowshipping, and finalizing the steps to implement the various works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gospel work in the schools must not be done by one person on a campus alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should have at least two students on a campus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The arrangement of the brothers' and sisters' occupations requires much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>PRESENTING OUR ALL FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to have the gospel spirit, not only must we offer up ourselves, but we need to accept the Lord's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can never forget what happened at 2:30 p.m. on February 13, 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prior to that time I was seeking for the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For a period of time I fasted and prayed in the park every Saturday in order that I would be equipped with the power of the gospel for preaching on Sunday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord was dealing with my entanglements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day I yielded to the Lord's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Weigh knows that I cared very much for good clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I had a special fondness for silk gowns with red dots.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But that day I took off my nice clothes, put on some old and simple clothes, went to the kitchen to prepare some paste, took a stack of gospel pamphlets, and pasted them on the walls of the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I also went around the city passing out gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was an unprecedented move in Foochow at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this, many people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1923, eleven of us young people organized ourselves into gospel teams.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We put on gospel T-shirts with gospel slogans in front and behind and paraded through the city for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This became quite a sensation, and there was a revival in the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fire of the gospel should not go out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After a man is saved, the gospel fire begins to burn within him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But many people do not allow this fire to carry them on to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all must repent for quenching the gospel fire in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have pursued what we should not have pursued.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not allow the Holy Spirit to be trapped and confined by us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we have spoken of here is based on the gospel work that we have been doing for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is based on our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we would all rise up to preach the gospel and save sinners.</S>
