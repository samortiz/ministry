   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING CHURCH AFFAIRS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to speak two things in relation to church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we have to be watchful of the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not let them take matters too lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, meetings should be held weekly because a week is a unit for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>CONCERNING THE RESPONSIBLE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Hsu is a very good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Liao has good recommendations from many sources, but I do not know him and therefore cannot say anything about him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Chien loves the Lord very much, but his experience is not deep enough; it needs to take deeper root.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Chen is young but is pure before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Ku has a good disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not have a hot temperament, and he is meek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is easy for him to get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But while he is a friendly person, he cannot exercise such friendliness in managing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is short of one thing strictness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who bears responsibility for the management of the church has to be strict.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses was meeker than any person who lived on earth Num 12:3 ; yet at the same time, he was very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he saw the people worshipping the golden calf, he did not wait for another word to smash the stone tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He forced the Israelites to drink of the ground powder from the golden calf and called upon the Levites to kill their own brothers Exo 32:19-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the responsible brothers have to be strict.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not know that much about the spiritual perception of Brother Shang.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Has his understanding increased during the past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is also a pure person, a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unfortunately he is short of spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today if anyone is short of spiritual understanding, he cannot be a responsible brother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not a man can easily change depends on the amount of spiritual understanding he has.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A responsible brother should not hold everything in his own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, he should learn to assign responsibilities and to supervise the brothers and sisters in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should not monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The responsible brothers should come together at least twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First they should be together one day per week to let the brothers and sisters know that at least they are available.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, there should be a co-workers' meeting in which the co-workers fellowship about going on in the work and about problems among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The co-workers should take care not to relax in the matter of Christian fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Problems among people and with things should be dealt with and taken care of in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No procrastination should be allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every meeting should begin with prayer and end with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ending prayer should be a prayer that leads to some kind of solution.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Arrangements and charges should be made concerning those who are rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Business affairs, once they are made clear after fellowship, should be assigned to the brothers and sisters for execution.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Be high in your expectation of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is better to be high than to be low.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the standard is too low, the result will be low even if the standard is attained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Learn from A. G. Gordon, who said that one should put a nail on the wall as high as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The responsible brothers have to set a high expectation for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they do not, the saints will never advance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Business affairs should be based on whether or not it is right to do something, not on whether or not it is hard to do it.</S>
