<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Divine Presence Being in Our Spirit</H2><P>The Triune God passed through the processes of incarnation and resurrection in order to dispense Himself into us. Through incarnation He could be Immanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us. His being with us outwardly does not fulfill His purpose to dispense Himself into our being, so He had to go through another process. The second process was His death and resurrection. In resurrection His physical form became a spiritual form. Through death and resurrection, He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He is Immanuel, the presence of the Divine Trinity. This presence is always with us in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), not only day by day but also moment by moment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Our Need to Be in the Divine Presence<br>in Order to Live with Christ</H2><P>To live with Christ, we need to be in His divine presence (Gal. 5:25a). The divine presence is the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. This presence is Immanuel, who is the real, practical Jesus, the Triune God with the tripartite man.</P><P>We live with Christ as Immanuel and walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In order to walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we must live with Christ as a person, who is Immanuel. Today Immanuel is the very life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God as His presence with us moment by moment. We have to realize that all day long we have another One with us. He is not only with us outwardly but also with us inwardly in our spirit every minute of the day. We do and say things one way when we are alone, but when we have someone else with us, we do and say things differently. We must ask ourselves, "Are we doing things in our own way, or are we doing things in another way because we realize that another One is with us?" If we realize that another One is with us, everything we do, such as shopping, will change.</P><P>There are very few Christians who walk, live, speak, and do things with Immanuel as another One with them. We have the doctrine of Immanuel, but we have very little experience of Immanuel. If we had more experience of Immanuel, we would not do many of the things we do today, such as gossip. On some occasions, while I am walking, I may see two sisters or two brothers talking together. Often as I approach them, they stop their conversation. They would not continue their conversation because another person was there. My presence changed their speaking. In like manner, the presence of the Lord changes our life. We all must have the realization and sensation that the Lord Jesus, who is our Savior, is also Immanuel. He is the Triune God with us, the tripartite men. We should not say or do anything in ourselves or by ourselves. We need to experience Immanuel.</P>
