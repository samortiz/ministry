   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 15:"Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place let him who reads understand ."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The period of time from the setting up of the idol in the temple to the appearing of Christ is three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once the idol is set up in the temple, the destruction of the temple is not far away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The destroyer first defiles the temple and then destroys it Psa 74:3-7; Isa 64:10-11; Lam 4:1; Dan 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God allowed the temple to be defiled and destroyed because the Jews themselves defiled it first Jer 32:34; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>8:5-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 16:"Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Let those in Judea flee" here and the woman's flight into the wilderness in Revelation 12:6 have the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The dragon's trying to devour the woman is the same as Satan's persecuting the Jews; therefore, the Jews must flee and the woman must flee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "water" Rev 12:15 indicates an army.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 12:16 says, "And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, if the Jews listen to the Lord's prophecy to flee, they will live for a thousand two hundred and sixty days and will not have to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 17:"Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take the things out of his house."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Him who is on the housetop."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Jewish houses had a flat top with a ladder on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not come down to take things out of the house; in other words, do not come down the ladder on the outside of the house to take the things that are in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 18:"And let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Him who is in the field."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who work in the field must flee quickly and not turn back to take their clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that one should not value material things, because the tribulation is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All who delay will experience woe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 19:"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is inconvenient for those who are with child and who nurse babies to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They cannot escape quickly; therefore, the Bible says, "Woe" to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 20:"And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One cannot flee quickly in the winter because one cannot sleep in the open.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The weather is also colder on the mountain than on the flat land, and there is no food and no water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The "Sabbath" in this verse is a further proof that verses 4-31 are directed to the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the law of Moses, on the Sabbath day one cannot walk more than approximately four thousand eight hundred and fifty-four feet Acts 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 21:"For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God already prearranged for the great tribulation to come, although because of grace and prayer Exo 32:34 it has been delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We sin every day, but because we pray, the disciplining whip delays its coming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we have to know that God's whip is merely withheld; it is not cancelled or locked away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may come suddenly at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nebuchadnezzar is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>See also Isa 65:6-7; Deut 4:30-31; Jer 30:6-7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only approximately one-third of the Jews will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both Daniel 12:1 and Revelation 12:7 refer to Michael chasing the dragon away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 22:"And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, those days will be cut short."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The record concerning the great tribulation in Isaiah 13:9-11 and 26:21 shows that it is terrible to the uttermost; therefore, the Lord intends to cut short those days to only three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they were prolonged, no one could withstand them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 23-24:"At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The purpose of this small section is to show that the Lord's parousia the "coming" in verse 27 is not secret but public to the Jews because the Lord comes from heaven on the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not that He comes to the earth first and then reveals Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This section warns the Jews against the deception of the false Christs "Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since Christ must come from heaven, the believers do not have this danger as the Jews have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the Jews desired to have a Messiah come to live among them, they rejected Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Behold, here...or, Here" means anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ will come from heaven like lightning; hence, if there are any selfproclaimed Christs appearing on the earth, they must be false Christs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The false Christs and false prophets are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not refer only to one person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The "great signs and wonders" that occur during the three and a half years take place because the dragon is there giving authority to the first and second beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second Thessalonians 2 and Revelation 13 are the records of the wonders of these three evil ones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A wonder is not an outright hoax or a sleight of hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The purpose of doing wonders is to make people believe a falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is in contrast to the Lord's signs, which guide people to believe the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If, at the end of the age, we should see the evil spirits doing wondrous things, this means that Satan is trying to make false things real.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those Christians living at the end of the age should pay even more attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our receiving of the truth is not because of wonders but because we believe the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should know that wondrous things will be abundant at the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"So as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The chosen here refer to the Jews Isa 65:9; Rom 10:21; 11:28 , but, doctrinally, it is not unrelated to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We believers also have the possibility of being led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who think they are able to stand should be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 25:"Behold, I have told you beforehand."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is most precious because it is the Lord's prophecy concerning the things of the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Suppose we were able to foresee the things in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Would this not be precious?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Robbery and accidents could be avoided in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet regrettably the saints do not treasure the prophecy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"Behold" in the Scripture means that something important must follow, so we know that the prophecy on the mount is important.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The prophecy is a lamp to our feet 2 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If one does not know prophecy, it is easy to stumble and fall in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today, the reason people have so much hope for the world, the country, and society is that they have no lamp shining upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord has already spoken; if we still suffer loss at the end of the age, the Lord will not be responsible.</S>
