   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALED IN THE BIBLE Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 1:3 THE EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we were saved, the grace of God filled our hearts with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, our life was filled with hope; we thought that from that point on, all our sins would be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We thought that, henceforth, we could overcome everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the time we were saved, we thought that no temptation was too great for us to overcome and no difficulty was too much for us to surmount.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our future was full of a glorious hope.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the first time, we tasted the peace of forgiveness and the savor of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time, it was so easy and sweet to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were filled with joy and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Heaven was so close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was nothing that was impossible for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, we thought that every day would be a day of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, that wonderful condition did not last, and that wonderful hope did not materialize.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sins that we thought were gone suddenly came back.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The sins that we thought we had overcome returned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We thought we had left them behind, but they came back to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our former temper came back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Pride returned, and our old jealousy flared up once more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may have tried to read the Bible but to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may have prayed, but the sweet taste was no longer there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gone was the former zeal for lost souls.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Love began to wane.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some matters were indeed dealt with, but we found others impossible to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our daily song became one of defeat rather than victory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We saw more failures than victories in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We began to feel a great lack within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we compared ourselves with Paul, John, Peter, and those in the first century, we felt that there was a great difference between their experience and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We could not help others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We could only speak to others about the victorious part of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We could not tell them of the part in us that failed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We felt that our days of victory were few and that our days of failure were numerous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Daily we lived in misery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the common experience of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we were saved, we thought that since our sins were forgiven, they would never come back to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We felt that once we had joy and peace, they would abide with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Unfortunately, the sins and temptations came back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There were fewer high experiences, and low experiences became common.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were fewer joyful times, and sorrowful times became common.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these circumstances, we experience two things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, temptations, pride, jealousy, and temper return.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, we endeavor to suppress ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as these sins come back, we struggle to suppress them and to stop them from manifesting themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who are successful in suppressing themselves think that they have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who have failed live in a cycle of failure, victory, sin, and remorse.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result they become extremely discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Shortly after they are saved, either they consciously suppress their sins, or they resign themselves to the thought that victory is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They become despondent and discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, they experience some victory; on the other hand, they also experience many failures.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they succeed in restraining themselves, their sins are temporarily stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when they fail, they concede to the inevitability of committing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, I would like to ask you a question before God: When the Lord Jesus went to the cross, did He expect us to have the kind of experience we have today?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He was crucified on the cross, did He know that our life would be victorious one day and defeated the next?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Did He know that we would be victorious in the morning and defeated in the evening?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are His accomplishments on the cross insufficient to make us serve Him in holiness and righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Did He shed His blood on the cross only with a view to deliverance from the punishment of hell, without a view to deliverance from the pain of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is His blood shed on the cross only sufficient to save us from the coming eternal pain of sin, without saving us from the pain of sin today?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, brothers and sisters, I cannot refrain from saying "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord has accomplished everything on the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When He was on the cross, He dealt not only with the pain of hell but also with the pain of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was reminded not only of the pain of the punishment of sin but also of the pain of the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has prepared a way of salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such a way enables us to live on earth in the same way that He lived.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers and sisters, not only did Christ take care of the suffering of hell; He also took care of the suffering of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In other words, His redemptive work has given us not only the position and basis to be saved in a shallow way, but also the position and basis to be saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We do not have to live the way we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to say "Hallelujah!" because there is a gospel for sinners and a gospel for "Christian sinners"!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The gospel for Christian sinners is preached in the same way that the cross was preached to us before.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is a gospel today for Christian sinners!</S>
