 <h2 class="head2">By God&rsquo;s Growing in the Believers</h2>
<p>The intrinsic growth of the church is by God&rsquo;s growing in the believers (Col. 2:19). We were reborn by the divine life, which is God Himself. Now we are being fed and watered, and God is causing us to grow. This growth is God Himself growing in us (Col. 2:19). When God gives us the growth in life, this means that He is increasing Himself within us. As we are feeding on the Word, and as we are being watered by the gifted ones, God Himself is moving and growing within us.</p>
<p>The last part of Colossians 2:19 tells us that the Body &ldquo;grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; We grow by God&rsquo;s growing within us. Of course, God in Himself is not growing because He is complete and perfect. His growing is within us, and how much He grows within us depends upon how much room we will give to Him to grow. We may be full of the world, of ourselves, of our own interests, but by reading the Bible, little by little the word of the Bible takes away some part of our worldliness, some part of our self-interest, and some part of our love for things other than God Himself. Then within us more room is given to God. Then He takes this room and expands and increases within us. This increase is His growth in us. His growth becomes our growth because we and He are one. The growth of the church is God&rsquo;s growth in the church. By our feeding on the Word and being watered by the gifted members, the negative things within us are taken away and there is more room for the very God who dwells in us. When He gets more room, He grows within us. This issues in the church&rsquo;s organic growth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Unto Maturity in the Divine Life,<br />
Reaching the Measure of the Stature of<br />
the Fullness of Christ&mdash;the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s growth in us is unto our maturity in the divine life (Col. 1:28; Eph. 4:13b). As we are growing, we are maturing until we reach the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13c). The fullness of Christ is the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23); thus, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ. Christ fills all in all, and He needs a great Body as His fullness. The Body of Christ, which is His expression, has a stature and this stature has a measure. The church grows with the growth of God until it reaches maturity. When it reaches maturity, it arrives at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). By then the church will be Christ&rsquo;s expression in full. This is the highest peak of the church&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Increase of Christ<br />
in His Organic Body as His Bride</h2>
<p>The church grows until it reaches maturity, which is the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ for His expression. This growth is for the organic increase of the church. This organic increase is the increase of Christ in His organic Body as His bride (John 3:29-30a). The fullness of Christ is His Body, and the Body of Christ is His counterpart, His bride. This is based upon the type of Eve being the counterpart of Adam.</p>
<p>God in His wisdom did not create a couple, but a single man, a &ldquo;bachelor.&rdquo; God brought all the living creatures to Adam and Adam gave names to all of them, but among these Adam did not find his counterpart. Finally, God put Adam to sleep, opened his side, and took out a rib. In typology, this is a picture of what happened to Christ in His death. His death on the cross was His being &ldquo;put to sleep&rdquo; by God. In the Bible, sleep means death (1 Cor. 15:18; 1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-14). When Christ was sleeping on the cross, a soldier pierced His side and out came blood and water (John 19:34). All that came out of Adam&rsquo;s side was the rib without the blood. At Adam&rsquo;s time in Genesis 2 there was no sin, so there was no need of blood for redemption. When Christ was sleeping on the cross, however, there was the problem of sin, so His death had to deal first with this sin problem. The blood came out of Christ&rsquo;s side for redemption. Following the blood, the water came out. The rib taken out of Adam&rsquo;s side and the water that flowed out of the side of Christ at the cross both signify the divine life. God used this rib, which was a part of Adam, and built a woman to be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart. Now God builds up the church with the divine life, the resurrection life of Christ.</p>
<p>Eve was built to match Adam in his image and likeness. When God brought Eve to Adam, he said, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:23). Eve became the counterpart of Adam and the increase of Adam. The man is not complete without the woman. The wife is the other half of the man, making him complete and being his increase. The church as the bride of Christ is the increase of Christ, the Bridegroom. This is clearly revealed in John 3:29-30, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; John the Baptist was saying that the bride is for the Bridegroom and the Bridegroom is increasing. He, John the Baptist, should not be considered because he is decreasing, being reduced to nothing. All our attention should be focused on the increasing Christ, who is now increasing all over the earth.</p>
