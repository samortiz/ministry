   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TEN BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REIGNING ASPECT OF THE MATURED ISRAEL 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we study it, the more we realize that no human hand could have written it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently Genesis is simply a book of stories; however, when we probe into the depths of this book through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we find that it contains something profound related to our experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we read superficially, we shall not be able to understand why the events of chapter thirty-eight are put after those of chapter thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not until we discover the spiritual significance of these chapters can we appreciate the deep meaning of their sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the record of the book of Genesis and according to our spiritual experience, Joseph should not be considered a person separate from Jacob, but rather as an aspect of Jacob's biography.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we first came to Abraham in this life-study, we pointed out that, in spiritual experience, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, they represent three aspects of the experience of one saint.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent three aspects of one spiritual man, and their biographies portray different aspects of the complete life of a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three aspects of one person, somewhat like the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the record of Genesis, God revealed Himself as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is not three separate Gods; He is one Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a similar way, spiritually speaking, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate persons, but three aspects of one complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we have not only the Triune God, but also a complete man of three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is difficult to determine whether Abraham or Jacob comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the historical record, Abraham was the grandfather, and Jacob was the grandson.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to spiritual experience, however, Jacob must come first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob was chosen before he was born Rom 9:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the complete saint was chosen as Jacob before birth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Ephesians reveals that this selection took place before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the complete person was chosen as Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was also fallen as Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then this chosen and fallen one was called as Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With Abraham, he not only was called, but also was justified and lived a life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, he inherited and enjoyed all the riches of Christ as Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After he had been called and justified, and while he was living a life by faith, he inherited all the riches of Christ and enjoyed them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As Jacob, he also struggled and suffered because of his strivings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, he was dealt with and became matured.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All this is the experience of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For all these experiences the choosing, the fall, the calling, the justification by faith, the living by faith, the inheritance and enjoyment of the riches in Christ, the self-struggling, the sufferings, the dealings, and the maturity there is the need of three persons, the need of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three represent you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are chosen and fallen as Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are called, we are justified by faith, and we live by faith as Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We inherit the riches of Christ and enjoy them as Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We struggle, suffer, are dealt with, and mature as Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Jacob was matured, his name was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only was his disposition transformed, but his name was changed from Jacob, a supplanter, to Israel, a matured prince of God, one who could reign for God.</S>
