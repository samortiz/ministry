   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The same is true about withstanding Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you withstand Satan in an inward way, you do not know whether or not the withstanding works.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if you say a few words, Satan will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The same is true with baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a person believes, he needs to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps some will think that it is too quick to baptize a person right after he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To believe with the heart is something that is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One must have the visible baptism before the matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To believe with the heart is mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be baptized in the body is tangible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same is true with consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A mystical consecration is not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many consecrations remain a mystical consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many say to the Lord, "I consecrate everything."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Gospel of Luke shows us that Zaccheus' consecration was very concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He offered up his possessions Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's command to him was also very concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the past one hundred years, the church has received many mystical consecrations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the consecrations at the time of the early apostles were tangible consecrations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time, when a man handed himself over, everything was settled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every brother and sister should hand over himself or herself; everyone should submit to the authority of the church and should be coordinated together with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Witness said it well: When the church is advancing and the material offering falls behind, it is the fault of the brothers and sisters; while, on the other hand, if the material offering is adequate, yet the gospel falls behind, it is the fault of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those brothers and sisters who participate in the spiritual services have to be coordinated, and those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should also be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some sisters wanted to offer up something, but I declined their offerings, because they had not offered up themselves yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Corinthians tells us that God first receives us, and then ours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The person has to come first, before the possessions and the time come also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE LORD BEING AFTER ABSOLUTE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The coordination that we are speaking of today is one that costs the co-workers' lives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is one that also costs the other brothers' and sisters' lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the brothers and sisters must have the Lord as their center, and they have to offer up everything for the gospel and for the service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not consider being a Christian to be our second profession.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some are professing Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we should be the "professional" Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ should be our first profession.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should offer up all their time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord demands that we deny ourselves for the sake of loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's demand is the same today as it was in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God's word, there is no place for halfway ones; there are only absolute ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord forbid that tonight's words be merely mysterious words in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May they be transformed to outward realities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May they not be merely notions, but realities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May they not be merely doctrines, but life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May they not be something that is nice to hear, but something that is good to see.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we not have fragmentary services, but complete services.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we not only have a consecration of the heart and the mouth, but a consecration of the hands and the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen.</S>
