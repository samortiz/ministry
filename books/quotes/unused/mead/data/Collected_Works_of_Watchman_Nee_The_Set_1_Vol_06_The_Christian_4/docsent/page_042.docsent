   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The present world can be said to be a lying world.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everyone lies to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How many are honest?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the family, even between parents, brothers, and sisters, there is much lying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lying is common even between husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the school there is much lying between teachers and students.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lying reaches its peak in government circles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Indeed, one has to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without lying, one may lose his position and even his office.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lying is even more commonplace in business circles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many business people have told me that if they do not lie, they will have no way to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they want to be honest, their only choice is to close their doors and terminate their business.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think that lying is the guiding principle in business and that without lying, their business will close down immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I remember a story.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A fabric store was once visited by a man from the country.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the man examined many kinds of fabric, he still was not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the end the shopkeeper took one of the previously examined rolls back into his shop and wrapped it with high-quality colored paper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He then presented it to the customer, saying, "This is the best fabric we have in this shop.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I just took it out from my warehouse."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The country man believed his word and bought it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one does not lie, he cannot run a business.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Several days ago I read in the newspaper of two British Christians who refused to put false labels on their goods.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were terminated by their employers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one will not lie in this world, he will lose his position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps some who are sitting here will say that they are not in business and have not lied in this way before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may not have not lied in this way, but have you exaggerated and said more than the truth in your conversations?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is lying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you made something big out of something small?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is lying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have you uplifted yourselves with lies because of a love for vainglory?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Have you said vague words in an attempt to avoid difficulties and misunderstandings?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is also lying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people, when confronted with difficulties, deceive others with untrue words in order to avoid facing sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Alas, we think that we are honest people only because we have not examined ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not believe me, go home and write down all the lies you said throughout the day in a little notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that anything you said other than yes to what should be yes and no to what should be no are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You should write down in your notebook everything other than these yes and no statements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then you will find out how good you are at lying!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me point out the biggest lie in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you know what the biggest lie in the whole world is?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please listen to 1 John 1:8, "If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we see a very important verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It points out man's biggest lie.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our lies are meant to deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are not meant to deceive ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not like to deceive ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We think that it is all right to deceive others because they are the ones who are cheated and suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are very unwilling to deceive ourselves because we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But subconsciously there are many who deceive themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse tells us how a man can deceive himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All those who say that they are without sin deceive themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are telling the biggest lie.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have said that those who lie will go to hell and perish.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The words of the Scripture will not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It may be all right for you to have told any kind of lie before.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if you say what is said in this verse, I feel uneasy for you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No lie in the world can compare to this lie.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who speak other lies may still have the hope of being rid of their sins and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But those who lie by saying that they have not sinned will surely be lost and go to hell; they are beyond hope.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When they lie in this way, they reject God's salvation and forbid the coming of the Lord's grace which makes it possible for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today many people say that they are without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They think that they are moralists, religionists, and the best people on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They think that they do everything according to their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since they think they are good, they say that they do not have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Preachers are the most unwelcomed because every time we open our mouths we show others that they have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is man's open wound.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you touch it a little, they will feel unbearable pain.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many people say, "What sin do I have?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Where are my sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is truly self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please remember I am not the one who says that you are deceiving yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Bible says this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All those who say that they do not have sin deceive themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How foolish is this!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What profit is there for one to deceive himself?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you are saved and spared from hell, you will receive the profit; the one who helps you to be saved receives nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Why do you need to deceive yourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why do you have to lie and say that you have no sin, making it impossible for you to be saved and liable to go to hell to suffer eternal torment and loss?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Has not your conscience told you even once that you are a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you examine yourself in the quiet of the night, have you not realized that you have sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>While you are in torment in the deepest part of your being, are you not aware of the problem of sin and the way to a solution?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>While you are alone and quiet, have you not thought of the punishment of hell?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Have you ever asked where you came from and where you are going?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I believe your conscience cannot be fooled to that extent.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Man's conscience tells him his real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am afraid that you are deceiving and cheating yourselves with your own lies by saying that you have no sin, that your sins are common sins of no significance, that there may not be a judgment after death, and that when man dies everything is over and there is no more judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You comfort yourselves with these words and think that, even though you have sinned, it is all right and you will not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Or you may think that you have no sin and will not come under any judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Actually, this is not self-consolation, but self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Why do liars go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Let me tell you something.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>No matter what lies someone has told in the past or is telling in the present, he can have the chance to be saved because the Lord Jesus has died for all his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The sin of lying has been judged in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Anyone can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Those who lie by saying that they have no sin, however, will go into eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They will go to hell, and there will be no chance for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>A man who lies that he has no sin is saying that he does not need a Savior for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Since he has no sin, why does he need to trust in the Savior to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If he has no sin, he will not suffer the punishment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If he will not suffer the punishment of sin, he will not need a Savior to assume the punishment of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, if he has sin, he needs a Savior or he will go into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>On the one hand, he thinks that he is without sin and has no need of a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>On the other hand, he definitely has sin and needs a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What then will be his end?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It will be perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>There is no other choice besides hell for him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Therefore, whatever lies you have told, you can still be saved through the merit accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But if you lie saying that you have no sin, there is no other choice for you except hell.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All who have not believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus will perish and all those who have believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Those who lie will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But if a liar believes in the Lord Jesus, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Those who lie saying that they have not sinned will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Unless a man first removes the sin of lying about his sinlessness, it will be impossible for him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Only those who really know that they have sinned will believe in the Lord Jesus, and only those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Therefore, those who lie and think that they have no sin will never be saved.</S>
