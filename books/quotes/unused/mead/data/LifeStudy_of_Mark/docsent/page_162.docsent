   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRISTIAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE PRODUCT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps I can illustrate the difference between human ethics and a life that is according to God s New Testament economy by telling you about the teaching of certain missionaries in China years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some missionaries clearly said that the Bible and Confucius teach the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They pointed out that both the Bible and Confucius teach the honoring of parents and the submitting of wives to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These missionaries also said that both the Bible and Confucius teach humility, honesty, integrity, faithfulness, and other such virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I first heard this when I was in elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, as a teen-ager, I began to say to myself, Since the Bible and Confucius teach the same thing, why was it necessary for the missionaries to come to China?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is no difference between the teaching of the Bible and the teaching of Confucius, then there is no need for the missionaries to teach us the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the Lord s mercy, I was saved at the age of nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was still bothered by the question concerning the difference, if any, between the teachings of the Bible and those of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I still wanted to know the difference between the human virtues taught by Confucius and the virtues of Christians taught in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For a number of years I did not know the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After nearly ten years of studying the Bible, my eyes were opened to see the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I began to see Christ as the center and circumference of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then I began to differentiate between the human virtues taught by Confucius and the Christian virtues taught by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I came to realize that the human virtues taught by Confucius are the product of human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those virtues do not have anything of God essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the genuine Christian virtues taught by the Bible are not the result of human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, Christian virtues are the product of the divine life lived out through the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the Christian virtues are related essentially to the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a difference there is between human virtues as the product of human effort and Christian virtues as the product of the divine life and nature within us!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may illustrate the difference between the human virtues taught by Confucius and the Christian virtues taught by the Bible by comparing brick with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we examine brick, we may find nothing wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we compare brick with gold, we shall see that there is a tremendous difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a similar way, there is a great difference between human virtues and Christian virtues produced by the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is tragic that most Christians, including Christian teachers, have not had a clear view of the difference between mere human virtues and genuine Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The virtues taught by Confucius and other philosophers are nothing more than human.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those human virtues do not have anything of the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have nothing to do with God s life and nature, much less with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christian virtues taught by the Bible are very different from mere human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The difference is that the nature of Christian virtues is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning this, Peter says in his second Epistle that we have become partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Christian virtues are the product not of outward effort but of an inward nature, the divine nature that we have received through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Christian virtues are related essentially to the divine life, the divine nature, and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Humanly speaking, for the good of society, we all must care for ethics, morality, behavior, and character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the sake of a proper human living in society we must emphasize these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, with respect to living God and expressing Him, mere human virtues are of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, they become a frustration to living and expressing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we would live God and express Him, we need to see that it is necessary even for the natural human virtues to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This termination is necessary for the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The beginning of the gospel implies the termination of all things other than God Himself.</S>
