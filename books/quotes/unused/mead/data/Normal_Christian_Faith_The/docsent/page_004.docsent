   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DO NOT JUDGE ACCORDING TO HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people are not really convinced that there is no God; they merely hope so.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They would rather that there were no God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For them it would be much more convenient in respect to many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I myself was one of those people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was a student I claimed that there was no God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I was extremely strong in my claim, something within me seemed to be protesting and saying, "There is a God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I knew deep in my heart that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But my lips refused to admit this so that I could have an excuse for sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By declaring the nonexistence of God, going to sinful places was justifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there were no God, I would become bold to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you believe in God, you dare not do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you do away with God, you feel free to commit the worst sins without any fear whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you sincerely hope to raise your moral standard by asserting the nonexistence of God, then your arguments are still plausible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the only reason men claim that there is no God is for an excuse for lawlessness, immorality, license, and indecency.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, their whole argument is not worthy of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The question is, "Are you qualified to claim that there is no God?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If your hope is merely for an escape from justice, you have lost your ground already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IS MAN THE GREATEST?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day a young man came to me and said, "I do not believe in a so-called God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the noblest among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no God in this universe; man is everything."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were sitting opposite each other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After hearing what he said, I stood up, went to one side of the room, stooped down, and gazed at him intently.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said, "You are really great!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I walked to the other side of the room and looked at him from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"That is right," I said deliberately; "You are great!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Kiangsu province there are thirty million who are like you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are at least four hundred million of your kind in China.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The world contains only two billion who are the same as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you realize that during the last few days there has been a flood in the south?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The dykes along the river are in jeopardy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The whole population in Hsing Hwa with more than two hundred thousand people have been recruited and rushed to the dykes in a panic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are carrying earth with them to reinforce the banks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The repair work is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Suppose that the world is recruited to hollow out the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A hole is drilled through the surface, and everyone has to remove a load from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Assuming that no one will be burned to ashes, do you think that they can do the job?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if all the people themselves were inside, they would not fill up the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you put several hundred planets the size of Earth inside and started shaking it, you would still find that the sun would be very empty inside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How many suns are there in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you realize that the number of solar systems is in the hundreds of millions?"</S>
