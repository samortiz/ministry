God's Kingdom Realized<br />When Everyone Serves</h2><p>If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us. It will be a kingdom of priests; all the people will be priests. This is glorious. I look forward to the day when all idols are removed from among us. Before the Lord, we should pay whatever price it takes to achieve this. The Levites paid the price; they were faithful in setting aside their personal affection. Only such people can have a share in the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Basis of the Priesthood&mdash;<br />God's Acceptance</h2><p>In order to fully understand the priesthood, we need to understand the way God dealt with the priests in the Old Testament. It is a great matter for God to allow a person to draw near to Him without being smitten. Only the priests could eat the showbread, serve at the altar, and enter the holy place. Only they could offer the sacrifices. Others died when they entered the holy place. God's acceptance is the basis of the priesthood. Since God has accepted us, should we not enter in today? Formerly, anyone would die if he dared to enter in. But today God says, "You can come!" How strange it is if we still feel reluctant to come.</p><h2 class="head2">E. God's Mercy Enabling Us<br />to Serve in Grace</h2><p>We need the Lord to open our eyes. It is grace in its highest form for a person to be given the privilege to serve Him. Those who really know God will say, "The grace that allows me to serve God is greater than the grace which brought me to salvation." The dog under the table can eat the crumbs underneath the table, but it cannot serve at the table. To be saved by grace is relatively simple, but not everyone can serve by grace. Today in the church, everyone who is saved by grace can also serve. It is foolish not to consider this to be a great grace.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Rejecting the Principle<br />of Having an Intermediary Class</h2><p>Today's Christianity acknowledges the presence of an intermediary class. Christianity as we see it today even divides God's priests and God's people into two classes. We look forward to the day when there is no more hierarchy among us. There may be one or two persons in the church who have failed. But the principle does not change. Today it is fashionable in Christianity to compromise principles. In principle, today's Christianity has fallen and has taken the way of the Israelites&mdash;the people and the priests have become two. May we not fall into such a system!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_123.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_125.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 50: Messages for Building Up New Believers (3) &nbsp; pg 124</div><br></body></html>
