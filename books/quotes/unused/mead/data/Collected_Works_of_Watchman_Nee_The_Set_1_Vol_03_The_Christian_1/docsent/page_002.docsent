   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTRODUCTION TO THE CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In May 1925, Brother Watchman Nee moved to Lo-hsing Pagoda, Foochow, in the province of Fukien in China.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition to starting on the work of his book The Spiritual Man, he established the Gospel Bookroom and began publishing The Christian magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following is an excerpt from the Narration of the Past by Brother Nee delivered on the Lord's Day, December 4, 1932:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While I was staying in Lo-hsing Pagoda, I felt the need to issue a regular publication which would give more emphasis to the truths of salvation and the church and deal as well with prophecies and types.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I intended this magazine called The Christian to be temporary in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1925 two issues were published; in 1926 ten issues were published; and in 1927 another twelve issues were published.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are three formats in the twenty-four issues of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first is a regular magazine format; the second is strictly on Bible exposition; and the third is a special edition format where one particular topic takes up the entire issue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among the first kind are Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13-14, 16, 19, 22, 24.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their general format is: 1 one long gospel message, 2 a series of short articles on spiritual teachings, fragmentary inspirational writings "Twelve Baskets Full" , fragmentary scriptural interpretations "Notes from My Bible" , 3 stories, 4 a discussion of different news events of biblical interests mostly having to do with prophecies concerning restoration of Israel , 5 a question and answer box, and 6 a study on Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among the second kind are Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 15, 18, 21, 23.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these are expositional studies on the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the first three chapters of Revelation are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each issue is devoted entirely to the study of the book; nothing else was covered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Note: this study of Revelation should be differentiated from a later study of Revelation in the Collected Works, which covers the entire book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among the third kind are Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>17 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Issue No. 17 is a translation of the book The Straight Path by Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It includes a foreword by Watchman Nee and Ruth Lee respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Issue No. 20 is a special issue on the topic of worship written by Ruth Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It covers different aspects of the Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have grouped all articles with the same type of format together and have published the magazine in sections according to the following division of books within the Collected Works:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Volume3:"Meditations on Genesis" and "Meditations on Revelation"</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The readers are reminded that this magazine is one of the earliest writings of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such, the style is at times archaic, and the translation at times unavoidably awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we trust that the Holy Spirit will shine through the truth unveiled and the life released.</S>
