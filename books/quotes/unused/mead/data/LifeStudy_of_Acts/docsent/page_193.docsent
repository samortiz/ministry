   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEPT IN THE CUSTODY OF THE UNJUST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CORRUPT ROMAN POLITICIAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 24:22 and 23 say, But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned the case, saying, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will determine your affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he directed the centurion to keep him in custody, and yet that he should have some liberty, and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Literally, the Greek word rendered the case in verse 22 means them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for liberty in verse 23 also means relief, ease.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to verse 24, After some days, Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and heard him concerning his faith in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Drusilla was a daughter of King Herod Agrippa.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was persuaded by Felix, who became enamored of her, to forsake her husband and marry him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This showed the intemperance and corruption of Felix, a Roman politician.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was an immoral person without self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 24 says that Felix heard Paul concerning his faith in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Literally, the Greek word translated his means the.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Reasoning concerning Righteousness,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Self-control, and the Coming Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 24:25 says, And as he was reasoning concerning righteousness, and self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Literally, the Greek word rendered was reasoning means to say thoroughly, discuss in argument or exhortation , dispute; the same as in 17:2 and 18:4, 19.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Realizing Felix s unrighteousness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>26-27 and intemperance, the apostle reasoned with him of righteousness and self-control, the control of passions and desires, especially here regarding the controlling of sexual desires.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The coming judgment is related to the resurrection of the unrighteous, which the apostle preached in verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostle also reasoned with Felix of the coming judgment as a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through this Felix became afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Felix certainly was an unrighteous politician.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As verse 26 indicates, he hoped to receive money from Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He expected a bribe, the giving of money unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Based upon this fact, Paul reasoned with him concerning righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that Felix also lacked self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of Felix s intemperate lust, Paul, in order to show Felix s sinfulness, also reasoned with him concerning self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, in his reasoning with Felix, Paul came to the matter of the future judgment for perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in 10:42 and Paul here and in 17:31 stressed the coming judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The resurrected Christ at His coming back will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory Matt 25:31-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is related to His second coming 2 Tim 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will also be the Judge of the dead after the millennium on the great white throne Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul s word to Felix was a strong warning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Felix became afraid, but he was not moved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sending Paul away, he said, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you v. 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Felix did send for Paul a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning this, 24:26 says, At the same time also he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; wherefore also he sent for him more frequently and conversed with him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates the Roman politician s corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His intention in sending for Paul was not to hear the gospel; rather, his purpose was to get money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two Years in Caesarea</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 27 concludes, And when two years were completed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wanting to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Porcius Festus was the successor of Felix as the governor of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Felix s leaving Paul bound again shows the corruption of Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Luke does not disclose what the apostle did during these two years in Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul may have used the time to be with the Lord for His move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If so, this may have influenced the Epistles he wrote during the time of his appeal in Rome Colossians, Ephesians, and Philippians which are the most mysterious, most profound, and the richest in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A PICTURE OF HYPOCRISY AND CORRUPTION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these chapters of Acts we have a picture of hypocrisy in religion and corruption in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What hypocrisy there was in Judaism!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Jews pretended to serve God, to please God, and to glorify God, yet they did many evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These chapters expose the evil of the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were religious in an evil way, even plotting to kill Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although they were evil, they still pretended to be those who worshipped God and pleased Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, in Judaism there was hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Roman politics we see corruption and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Felix knew that Paul had not done anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, in justice Felix should have released Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, in order to gain favor with the Jews and with the hope of receiving money from Paul and his friends, he kept Paul in custody for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Felix allowed Paul s friends to visit him, but his purpose in doing so was to receive money.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result, in an unrighteous way Paul was kept in custody for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the following message we shall consider what Paul might have done during those years.</S>
