<h1 class="title">THE BASIS OF SERVICE&mdash;<br />
THE FIRE FROM THE ALTAR</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:3-9; Luke 12:49-50; 1 Cor. 3:12-15; Heb. 12:28-29; Rev. 1:13-14</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRE FROM THE ALTAR BEING<br />
THE BASE OF OUR SERVICE TO GOD</h2>
<p>Every service to God must be based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. In the Old Testament the priests burned incense before God. The burning of incense symbolizes the service rendered to God by man. The fire used to burn the incense had to be taken from the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 16:12-13). If a person did not burn incense with the fire from the altar of burnt offering, that is, if he offered strange fire, his service was not accepted by God, and he suffered the judgment of death (10:1-2). This example shows that our service to God must be based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel followed the tabernacle in their journey through the wilderness, their service before God began with the burning of the fire on the altar of burnt offering. The fire on the altar of burnt offering descended from God (9:24). The children of Israel could not begin their service to God until the fire descended. Although they had been delivered by God out of Egypt, had crossed the Red Sea, and had raised up the tabernacle at the foot of Mount Sinai, they could not serve God, because they did not have a basis for their service. The basis of their service was the altar of burnt offering with fire burning upon it. It was not adequate to have the altar of burnt offering. The altar had to have the fire that descended from God.</p>
<p>God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt so that they might serve Him (Exo. 3:12; 9:1). After the Israelites were rescued out of Egypt, they were in a position to serve God. However, they could not serve Him, because they did not have the altar. Even after the tabernacle was raised up and the altar of burnt offering was put before the entrance of the tabernacle, the children of Israel still could not serve God, because fire had not yet descended from heaven. At the beginning of Leviticus God was before the Israelites, yet they still could not serve Him. It was not until chapter 9 that God led them to do what was necessary for fire to come down from heaven.</p>
<p>The offering of the burnt offering was the prerequisite for fire to descend from heaven. Merely having the altar was not sufficient; the burnt offering had to be placed on the altar. After the sacrifice of the burnt offering was killed, skinned, cut, washed, and placed on the altar, fire could descend from heaven. God wanted the service of the children of Israel to be based on this fire. The burning of incense was their service to God, but the fire used for burning incense had to be taken from the altar. Hence, the service that we render to God must originate from the fire on the altar of burnt offering, and our service must be the issue of the burning of this fire.</p>
<p>Instead of using the fire from the altar, Nadab and Abihu used their own fire to burn incense in their service to God (10:1). Consequently, their service was not accepted by God, and they suffered the judgment of death (v. 2). This incident is a warning from God that our service must be based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. We cannot use any energy other than this fire. Every item of the service of the children of Israel before God issued out of the fire burning on the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>Fire is a source of energy. Everything that moves in the physical world uses energy, and energy is produced through burning. In order for our service to be full of energy, our service must pass through the fire on the altar. This is not strange fire, which is of man and of the earth. Rather, this is holy fire. This fire is of God and of heaven. Our service must come out of the burning of God&rsquo;s fire. This fire should be the energy, the driving force, the impulse within us. Then our service will be out of God, not out of ourselves.</p>
<p>God accepted the service of the Israelites based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. Shortly after entering the land of Canaan, the children of Israel failed, became desolate, and the Ark was carried away. As a result, the people could not serve God properly. After a period of desolation, David was raised up by God. David had a desire to serve God and to build a house for God. This desire was fulfilled through his son Solomon. After Solomon finished building the temple, he took the bronze altar, the altar of burnt offering, and put it in the temple. He also offered sacrifices and the burnt offering upon the altar (2 Chron. 7:1). At that time, the service to God was resumed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the service of the children of Israel in the temple was based on the fire from the altar of burnt offering. Every time they burned incense and served before God, they had to pass through the altar of burnt offering. They had to use the fire taken from the altar to burn incense. The fire was kept burning on the altar continually until the destruction of the temple (Lev. 6:13).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the tabernacle of God, the temple of God (John 1:14; 2:21). Any people who had the desire to serve God had to serve through the Lord Jesus. They had to go to Him. The Lord also set up an altar&mdash;the cross on Golgotha&mdash;and offered Himself upon it as the burnt offering. Then one day fire came down. This fire was the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4). The Lord Jesus Himself was willing to go to the cross and offer Himself to God. He also led Peter, John, James, and the rest of His lovers and followers to offer themselves to God, just as He did. Therefore, God accepted them as a satisfying fragrance of Christ (cf. 2 Cor. 2:15). Before Pentecost a hundred and twenty lovers of Jesus gathered in an upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 1:13-15) and presented themselves to God. As a result, on the day of Pentecost the Spirit descended upon them as tongues of fire. This was the beginning of the New Testament service. The New Testament service began on the day of Pentecost with the fire that came down and began to burn.</p>
<p>The energy and the motivating power for the New Testament service did not originate in man, that is, in the Galilean fishermen. The energy and the motivating power for the New Testament service began with fire from heaven. The fire that descended upon the Galilean fishermen became the energy and the motivating power within them. After the day of Pentecost they could speak for God, preach the gospel, save sinners, and establish churches. The disciples were not the source of the power for their work. The source of that power was heaven; the power came from the fire that descended from heaven.</p>
<p>At the time of Pentecost there was a great number of people in Jerusalem. However, the fire descended only on the hundred and twenty because they were on the altar of burnt offering. The fire of the Spirit descends only on the altar of burnt offering. This was not the fire of judgment, which will come in the future. This was the fire of salvation (Luke 12:49). This fire burns on those who love God, who offer themselves to God, who are willing to forsake everything for God, and who are willing to place themselves in His hands in order to be slain and broken. Their service to God is the issue of the burning. Whether in the Old Testament type or in the New Testament reality, man&rsquo;s service to God always comes out of the fire from the altar.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Service for Building Up the House of God &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
