God is Spirit, and He created a spirit for man that man may worship Him. Animals and plants do not have a spirit. Only human beings have a spirit. This is not a small matter.<h2 class=head2>Zechariah 12:1</h2><p>Zechariah 12:1b says, &#8220;Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.&#8221; This verse speaks of three things created by God: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. In God&#8217;s eyes there are three important items in the universe: the stretching forth of the heavens, the laying of the foundations of the earth, and the forming of the spirit of man within him. This verse does not speak of the heavens, the earth, and man but the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man within him. In God&#8217;s view this spirit is as important as the heavens and the earth.<h2 class=head3>The Human Spirit Being for Containing and Worshipping God</h2><p>We have a mouth and a stomach in our body to contain food. Without food we humans cannot exist. However, what God considers most important in our being is not our physical organs or psychological faculties but our spirit. Our spirit is our spiritual &#8220;stomach&#8221; to contain God Himself. The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that He who eats Him will live because of Him (John 6:48, 57). How can we eat Him, and where is He after we eat Him? We receive Him with our spirit into our spirit. God created man with a mouth and a stomach for man&#8217;s physical existence. At the same time, He also created a spirit for man to receive Him. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that when we worship and contact Him, we must be in our spirit and exercise our spirit.<h2 class=head3>The Secrets of Exercising Our Spirit</h2><p>One of the secrets of exercising our spirit is to call on the name of the Lord. We may consider calling on the name of the Lord as the best secret of exercising our spirit. For example, the secret of exercising our feet is to walk. For walking, we use our feet; for seeing, we use our eyes; for hearing, we use our ears; and for praying, we use our spirit. Whenever we pray, we need to use our spirit. Some may have the feeling that when they pray they are often in their mind and not in their spirit. Praying in spirit requires much exercise. This may be likened to a child learning to walk. Before he can walk, he must first learn to crawl and later to stand. After he can stand, then he learns to walk. Once he learns to walk, he no longer needs to crawl or hold on to something. Perhaps when you first start to pray, you are in your mind; but after much practice in praying, you will gradually be in spirit. After further practice, you will reach a point that whenever you pray, you pray in your spirit and with your spirit. Prayer is not just for petitioning God but even more for contacting and fellowshipping with God. Therefore, the best way to pray is to call on the name of the Lord. The Bible even tells us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). The only way to pray unceasingly is to call on the name of the Lord.<p>Besides praying, we need to read the Bible. Reading the Bible is not for gaining more knowledge and doctrines but for receiving spiritual supply. The Bible contains profound truths that are not for the believers&#8217; objective knowledge but for their subjective experience. To dive into these profound truths, we need to use our spirit because the Lord said that His words are spirit and are life (John 6:63). To touch the spirit in the Lord&#8217;s words, we need to use our spirit. When we use our spirit, we dive into these profound truths, which are able to help open up our prayers, making them more penetrating and richer. Whether our prayers are deep and rich depends totally upon our knowledge of the truth.<p>Therefore, there are two secrets of exercising our spirit: prayer and pursuing the truth. These two matters complement each other. We must pray, and we must also dive into the truth. Praying can help us get into the truth. The more we get into the truth, the deeper and richer our experiences will be. Even the sense we have when calling on the name of the Lord becomes deep, rich, and weighty. In this way our taste and feeling for the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will be very different from that in the past.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
