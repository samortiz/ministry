These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo
They lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation
The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God
We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible
Although a man may not have committed a sin, he is positionally sinful before God because he is a descendant of Adam
No one can say that he has never sinned or that he has clean hands, an undefiled heart, and no experience of sin
When God condemned Adam because of his sin, God also condemned the entire human race in Adam through his one offense
Although God condemns man's sin according to His righteousness, He has not yet executed this condemnation because of His love
According to the Lord's word in Mark 9:48, in the lake of fire 'their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched'
From his youth man's heart not only has an evil imagination but is also deceitful above all things and is incurable
Since man was brought forth in iniquity and has an utterly deceitful and incurable heart, how can there be anything good in his flesh?
In addition to the fact that nothing good dwells in man's flesh, his heart is filled with unrighteousness and sin
No one is absolutely upright and clean, and no one is able to withstand God's shining and examination of his inward parts
People today are powerless with regard to righteousness, and they have no sense of shame or remorse with regard to sin
Man's being without feeling regarding sin may be likened to a corpse that has no feeling while lying in the garbage
Man's insensitivity to sin is the result of being dead within; this insensitivity proves that man is dead within
It is indecent and shameful for a man to embrace a woman in a dance, yet people believe that it is noble and honorable
Originally, man belonged to God, but now he belongs to sin; originally, God was man's Lord, but now sin is his lord
Man lies sins and lusts in a manner similar to the devil because the lying sinning and lusting life and nature within man are of the devil
Satan rules through his messengers in the air over the darkness of this world in order to subject men to himself
By operating in their hearts, Satan causes men to be subject to him; thus, they become sons of disobedience and oppose God
Mans actions are not entirely under his control he acts according to the spirit which is now operating in his heart which is Satan himself
Although they understand philosophy and science, men do not understand the things of God or know the salvation of the Lord
Satan uses the persons, matters, and things that man worships to darken man's mind and to prevent him from knowing God
Men do not foresee their destiny or the torment of hell because they consider the pleasures and enjoyment of human life to be more important
Because their heart worships these things and their eyes esteem them, their mind is darkened and blinded by Satan
How pitiful are drug addicts, alcoholics, and those who give themselves over to fornication and lasciviousness!
While John 3:16 says that God so loved us, Ephesians 2:4 says that the love with which God loved us is a great love
Since our sins brought us under the requirements of God's righteousness and holiness, God could not receive us or abide with us peaceably
Despite His love for us, God could not forgive and save us carelessly, because He could not contradict His own righteousness and holiness
Because of His love toward us, God was willing to send the Lord Jesus to die for us and to accomplish our salvation
Many who have heard the preaching of the Word testify that they met many people who beseeched them to believe in Jesus
Since the time of the apostles, God has never ceased sending His slaves to call people to His feast of salvation
Although they encountered every kind of difficulty in China, they still came because God's love urged and sent them
Because of His love, God not only sends His slaves to preach the gospel but also sends the Holy Spirit to work in the hearts of men
The Holy Spirit follows our speaking, confirming the gospel and touching man's heart until he is compelled to believe
Many times when we preach the gospel, God's power makes the gospel extremely powerful so that people are compelled to believe
God bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit'
In addition to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, God also uses signs, wonders, and works of power to confirm the gospel
When His servants preach the gospel, God confirms the gospel through healings and the casting out of demons, thus causing people to believe
What God's love has prepared for man in order that man may receive His salvation is altogether complete and absolute
In addition to causing us to be saved and to escape destruction, God's love imparts the divine life into us so that we may be His children
Nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God-neither death nor life nor things present nor things to come
The accomplishment of Christ's redemption is not only through His death but also through His resurrection, ascension, and second coming
The Lord Jesus was sinless, but when He died on the cross, God placed our sins upon Him so that He might bear them for us
The Lord Jesus suffered on our behalf-that is, the Righteous suffered on behalf of the unrighteous-in order to eliminate our sins before God
No sinner can pass through the judgment of God's righteousness and law without suffering the punishment of death
The Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to fulfill the righteous requirement of God's law so that our sins may be forgiven
Since the Lord's blood was shed through His death in fulfillment of God's righteous requirement, His blood can cleanse us of our sins
The Lord's death redeemed us from our sins and restored our relationship with God; as a result, we were reconciled to God
Today, if anyone is willing to believe in the Lord, the Lord's death will reconcile him to God and appease God on his behalf
He died once, accomplishing a complete redemption for all, including those who lived before His death and those who lived after His death
The substitutionary death of Christ on the cross dealt with our sins; our co-death with Christ on the cross dealt with our old man
In addition to our flesh with its passions and its lusts, our self, our person, was also crucified with Christ
Christ did not require us to die by ourselves; rather, He brought us to die with Him in His death on the cross
Regardless of whether we feel that we have died with Him, in Christ we have died with Him; this is a fact before God
We should not pay attention to our feeling; rather, we should believe, saying, 'We died in Christ and with Christ'
Through His death the Lord eliminated our sins before God, dealt with our sinful nature, and abolished the devil
The Lord's cross destroyed both the prince of darkness, Satan, and his kingdom of darkness, including all its rulers and authorities
All persons, matters, and things have been utilized by Satan as the system of his organization-the world-to control and usurp people
The cross of Christ judged and abolished the ruler of the world; it also judged and abolished the world itself
The cross of Christ dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh with its passions and its lusts, Satan, and the world
When we as fallen men were crucified with Christ on the cross, Satan, who was mingled with us, also was crucified
His resurrection declares that His death satisfied God's righteous requirement; thus, God can justify us according to His righteousness
When we see the Lord's resurrection and ascension, we are clear that our debt before God has been paid and that a 'receipt' was issued
His resurrection not only resulted in our justification objectively but also gave us a life that works out righteousness subjectively
A man who sold Bibles from village to village told people that if they would read the Bible, they would be able to refrain from sin
A person who possesses Christ's resurrection life can live in this sinful world without being contaminated by sin
Those who believe in Christ and have His life 'shall by no means die forever' ; even if we should die, we shall live
God's way of salvation included not only our dying with Christ but also our being made alive together with Him
Being made alive with Him, on the positive side, brought us into the new creation and everything that is in God
His death delivered us from everything outside of God; His resurrection brought us into everything that is in God
He died on the cross once for all according to God's righteous requirement, but He is always living in us so that we may live a holy life
His death on the cross satisfied God's righteous requirement; His living in us causes us to live a life of holiness
His death solved our problems, His resurrection enabled us to obtain God's life, and His ascension brought us into a heavenly position
In the original Greek the phrase rendered He led captivethose taken captive means that He led captive the vanquishing power of the enemy
On the cross the Lord Jesus destroyed Satan and his power, and in His ascension He vanquished Satan's power to capture people
The ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ put Him far above all that is on the earth as well as all that is in the air, where Satan rules
In God's salvation we died with Christ and were made alive with Christ; we were also seated with Him in the heavenlies
God placed us in Christ, uniting us with Him; thus, we died and resurrected with Christ and are seated with Him in the heavenlies
Because of the life of Christ within us, we are joined to the heavenly Christ and seated together with Him in the heavenlies
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is a result of the ascension of the Lord Jesus; it also proves that He ascended
The Holy Spirit empowers us for the Lord's testimony; the gifts equip us to serve the Lord and to build up the church
His ascension raised us far above Satan's power of darkness, and He gave the Holy Spirit and gifts, enabling us to serve Him
We were delivered from a sinful living by the Lord's life, but we often still feel the working of sin within us
The life within us is spiritual and is connected to the heavens, but today we are still in the flesh on the earth
We have the Lord's presence, but we are still on the earth, which is full of evil, filthiness, turmoil, unrest, and pain
The earth cannot compare with the bright, heavenly home and the glorious, holy city that the Lord has prepared for us
The Bible reveals that when the believers die, although their bodies are buried in the grave, their souls enter into Paradise
Although we have the Lord's presence within us, we are outwardly separated from the Lord and live in a world full of sufferings
The redemption of our body'; 'Who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory'
The Lords death redeemed our person and His resurrection regenerated our spirit thus we were saved transformed and became a new creation
He will change the nature of our body: corruptible will put on incorruption, and mortal will put on immortality
Our body will be redeemed to enter into glory our whole being will be redeemed to enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
Today we groan and toil in our temporal tabernacle, but when we enter into the eternal building, our groaning and toil will cease
Although the Lord's resurrection gave us His life and nature and made us like Him inwardly, we do not have His likeness outwardly
When the Lord returns, He will transfigure our body; we will have His glorious image outwardly and will be like Him in our whole being
The Lord's resurrection enabled Him to enter into us to be our life, but His life within us is a hidden mystery and a hidden glory
In the Lord's ascension our life is hidden with Christ in God, but this also is a hidden mystery and a hidden exaltation
God saved us to serve Him in His presence, and He wants us to also be kings to reign over the people on the earth
The Lord gave us His life that we may be the children of God, and He gave us His authority that we may be the kings of God
The Lord will shepherd us and guide us to the springs of waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from our eyes
He laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the abyss'
Thank the Lord that His salvation includes not only His death, resurrection, and ascension but also His second coming
Salvation originated in God's love, was accomplished through Christ's redemption, and is applied through the work of the Holy Spirit
The work of the Holy Spirit applies the very salvation that came out of God's love and was accomplished through the redemption of Christ
We can illustrate Gods salvation in this way God is an author Christ is a typesetter the Holy Spirit is a printer and we are sheets of paper
The work of the Holy Spirit is necessary to transform the fact of our redemption in Christ into our subjective experience
We were dead within, but the Holy Spirit imparted God's life into us so that we might be regenerated and made alive
The Holy Spirit reveals to man that Gods charge to believe in the Lord Jesus is not only a Godgiven grace but also a commandment to sinners
If a sinner does not believe in the Lord Jesus, he not only rejects God's grace but also defies God's commandment
The Holy Spirit shows man that Satan, who opposes God and is God's enemy, has been judged on the cross of Christ
Since the ruler of the world Gods enemy has been judged how could those in the world who follow Satan to be enemies of God not be judged
Since Satan was judged on the cross of Christ, he no longer has authority to control those who believe in Christ
The Holy Spirit convicts man concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment-that is, concerning the contents of the entire gospel
If man believes in Christ, he is delivered from his sins, obtains God's righteousness, and is spared from Satan's judgment
After the Holy Spirit convicts and enlightens a man and causes him to repent, He testifies to him concerning Christ
The Holy Spirit reveals Christ to man, showing him that Christ is the Savior of sinners and the One who bore man's sins on the cross
The Holy Spirit imparts the life of God into those who receive Christ as their Savior, thus enlivening the deadened spirit within them
When a man is regenerated by the Holy Spirit and his spirit is made alive, he becomes a living epistle of Christ
The believers possess the life of Christ and are joined to Christ; they are born again by receiving Christ as their life
After finishing the work of regeneration, the regenerating Holy Spirit immediately becomes the indwelling Holy Spirit
The Spirit indwelling us is Christ and God indwelling us, causing us to be joined to Christ and God and to belong to Christ and God
The Holy Spirit dwells in the believers not only to be present with them but also to do many things and to manifest many functions in them
Once we are saved, God seals us with the Holy Spirit, marking us out as those who belong to God and are God's inheritance
We know that we are persons who belong to God because once we believed, God placed His Spirit upon us as a seal
He makes our thoughts, motives, conversation, actions, and all things like God and Christ and different from the world
When people see us, they not only realize that we belong to God and Christ, but they also sense that we are like God and Christ
The Bible tells us that God has kept an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance in the heavens for us, which will not fade away
What the Holy Spirit gives us within-the presence of the Lord, the peace, joy, and sweetness of the Lord-is irreplaceable
When the Lord Jesus prays for us in the heavens, the Holy Spirit comforts and cares for us within according to the prayer of the Lord Jesus
He reveals all the mysteries and the meaning of the truths in the Bible so that the believer can understand them and enter into them
The indwelling Holy Spirit not only leads us to understand the meaning of the truth but also guides us into the reality
As an anointing causes a soothing and refreshing sensation, the Holy Spirit's moving within us also gives the same kind of feeling
The deepest and most subjective aspect of His help is that He Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
These groanings are unutterable to us because 'we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting,' but they are not unutterable to Him
We do not know how to utter the burden within us; therefore, we are short of utterable words to express our inner feelings
Although we sense a heavy burden, we do not have the words to express the burden and do not know how we should pray
Whenever we are sad and grieving yet sense the comfort of God or a mysterious comfort within, this comfort is from the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit in the believer also causes the believer to be released and freed from sin and all kinds of bondage
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control'
He not only causes us to be one with one another, but He Himself is the oneness of the believers and the oneness of the church
Once the Holy Spirit occupies His rightful place in us, He causes us to put off all bondage within and without, and thus we are freed
When the Holy Spirit fills us, He flows the Lord's life out from us as rivers of living water to quench others' thirst
Our disobedience, trespasses, and offenses can only cause Him to be grieved and sad ; they cannot cause Him to leave us or forsake us
The Holy Spirit abides in us as the seal of God's ownership as well as the pledge of our heavenly inheritance unto the day of redemption
The Holy Spirit moves within us like a burning fire; we should not pour water on the Holy Spirit to quench His inspiration
If He touches us not to do a certain thing or say a certain word, we should obey by not doing that thing or speaking that word
If we neglect, disobey, quench, and go against His anointing and moving within us, He will be grieved, making us gloomy and unhappy
Our being joyful or gloomy is the evidence that we are those who obey the Holy Spirit or those who go against the Holy Spirit
On the negative side, we must not quench or grieve the indwelling Holy Spirit; on the positive side, we must walk according to Him
On the positive side, regarding the indwelling Holy Spirit, we should not only walk according to Him, but we should even mind Him
We must let Him remove sin, the world, the flesh, and all that is outside of the Lord so that He may have His full place in us
Not only are we responsible to be filled with the Holy Spirit, but we are also responsible to be full of the Holy Spirit
To keep what we have obtained by the Holy Spirit's continuous filling, we must be responsible to always be full of the Holy Spirit
On the one hand, the Lord Jesus told us that the Holy Spirit would be in us , and on the other hand, that He would come upon us
The first part was accomplished during Pentecost in the upper room on the disciples in Jerusalem and on the Jewish believers
The second part was accomplished after Pentecost in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea and on the Gentile believers
In the twopart completion of this baptism the one unique baptism the Lord Jesus baptized all the believers in every age in the Holy Spirit
The baptism in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact, just as the death of the cross is an accomplished fact
When a believer obtains life by faith and becomes part of the church, he also shares in the baptism the church received
Just as a child can enjoy the riches the father earned, the believers can enjoy the baptism the church obtained
According to the fact of baptism, once a person becomes a believer through faith, he is already baptized in the Holy Spirit
In these verses, however, a different Greek word is used to speak of being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly
Although they have experienced the regeneration and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, they have not experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit
They have the experience of the Holy Spirit's being in them, but they should seek the outward experience of the Holy Spirit also
These two steps, the coming upon and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, include all the work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer
Spiritual gifts are spiritual abilities and skills, enabling the believer to do spiritual things and to manifest spiritual functions
All the gifts given through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit enable the believer to do things for God so that all may profit
The inspiration of the Holy Spirit is given for what is profitable and also causes one to say, 'Jesus is Lord'
All inspirations that do not produce a confession that Jesus is Lord are not of the Holy Spirit but of evil spirits
Among the four steps of the work that the Holy Spirit accomplishes on the believers, two are inward and two are outward
Regeneration and indwelling occur in the believers, whereas outward filling and inspiration occur outside the believers
Outward filling and inspiration are for the spiritual work of the believers so that they may possess both power and gifts for spiritual work
We should not think that because we have regeneration and indwelling within, we have no need of filling and inspiration without
Originally, man's thoughts are toward things apart from God, and these direct man to carry out things that are apart from God
Everything related to the fallen man, who is controlled by his mind, is turned from God toward things apart from God
Just as his sinful and evil acts are apart from God and toward wickedness, his proper and good acts also are apart from God
Such a turn begins with the mind; then it will affect his outward actions and behavior until his entire life and being are turned toward God
Repentance according to the human concept does not cause a person to turn to God; this is not the repentance that God desires
A person may give up movies, but if he turns to other things, even proper things, his mind is still not turned to God
A person may change from being wicked to being kind and from being wrong to being right, without turning to God
According to the Bible, the repentance that results in man's salvation can never be unto anything other than God Himself
He touches man's feelings and gives him a repentant heart so that he will turn from everything apart from God back to God
One day however God by the Holy Spirit has mercy on them causing their thinking to turn from sin the world and other things back to God
Because man forsakes God, commits sin and evil in rejecting God, and offends God, he should be punished and destroyed by God
Those whose minds are not turned to God cannot sense their need of the Lord Jesus and therefore will not have faith in Him
His sinful and evil deeds are not under God's rule, but even his charitable and just deeds are not under God's rule
Only these will live in the reality of the heavenly kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future
To share in such a salvation of God we must repent from all that refuses the rule of God and submit ourselves under Gods heavenly government
When a man's mind turns to God to make a way for Him, the Lord immediately enters into him to be his salvation
If man does not regret his sin of turning away from God and return to God in his heart, he will not believe in the Lord Jesus
For man to obtain the Lord's life, he must repent, realizing that his life is corrupt and that his living, which is outside of God, is evil
We have already seen that there is a difference between worldly repentance and the repentance spoken of in the Bible
One who merely agrees with the teaching that the Lord Jesus died for man to redeem man from his sins cannot be considered as having believed
Even if he admits the fact of the redemption of the Lord Jesus, he still cannot be counted as one who believes
What is agreed with and acknowledged may not necessarily be received, but what is received is definitely agreed with and acknowledged
He who believes has eternal life'; 'He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life'; 'Come to Me and drink
The Lord gave His flesh for us to eat so that we may have His life; He gave His blood for us to drink so that we may enjoy His redemption
His life is the river of living water that enters into man to quench his thirst so that he may be satisfied forever
Simply understanding and apprehending Him with the mind or agreeing with Him and acknowledging Him with the will are inadequate
Food and water can never fill or quench our thirst if we only agree with and confess their ability to fill and quench our thirst
By the same token, we cannot obtain the Lord's salvation merely by agreeing with and acknowledging the Lord Jesus
The Lord's salvation is like the supply that food and water bring to people; it is subjective and must be mingled with us
Just as we receive food and water through eating and drinking, we must receive the Lord Jesus through believing
To believe is not simply to have faith in the Lord Jesus' ability to save; it is also to enter into Him by faith and to be joined to Him
We must not only believe in the Lord Jesus' ability to save us, but we must also believe into Him to be united with Him
Genuine believing causes man to obtain the Lord's salvation, which is to believe into the Lord and to be joined to Him
One must believe into the Lord in order to participate in His redemption and to obtain the salvation that is in the Lord
Whether one's believing involves receiving and entering into depends on whether there is repentance before and calling after believing
If a person's mind turns to God, his heart will surely receive the Lord, and his mouth will definitely call upon Him
Praying or calling upon the Lord in this way is proof that one has indeed believed into the Lord and possesses real faith
Whether or not one's believing is real and proper depends on whether he has turned to the Lord and belongs to the Lord
Belief in the heart is based on a vision in the spirit, and such a vision always comes from the revelation of the Holy Spirit
Without the revelation of the Holy Spirit, the human spirit cannot see, and when man's spirit fails to see, his heart will not believe
God imparts faith into us because His grace is exceedingly abundant, not because we have any virtue or strong points
It is impossible for us to truly not believe, even though we may occasionally deny Him, because the precious faith given to us is in us
God who dwells in unapproachable light is the Father ; God expressed is the Son ; and God coming into man is the Spirit
We do not believe in a religion, even Christianity, nor do we believe in a certain teaching, not even a teaching about Christ
We believe on the Lord Jesus who is both God and man by receiving Him as our Savior through faith thus entering into Him to be joined to Him
As the Son of God, He expresses God and declares God; as the Christ of God, He came to accomplish God's will and to fulfill God's plan
Indeed, He became Jesus to be our Savior, yet we must believe that He is the Christ who fulfilled God's will and completed His plan
In different times and ways the Bible repeatedly shows and leads man to believe that Jesus is the Christ of God and the Son of God
To receive His life, we must believe that Jesus, the Son of Man, is also the Son of God because 'this life is in His Son
His death is acknowledged by all, yet no one can believe in His resurrection without the revelation of the Holy Spirit
His death redeemed us from our sins objectively; His resurrection imparts life into us subjectively and makes us one with Him
The gospel is not a common teaching; it specifically speaks of Christ dying for our sins, being buried, and rising again
Only the gospel that speaks of Christ and the redemption He accomplished through His death and resurrection can save people
The testimony of God concerning His Son is the words in the Bible that deal with the person and work of Christ
The Lord Jesus and all that He has accomplished are in these words of witness, the Bible, for us to believe and receive
If we do not believe these words of testimony, we cannot believe in the Son of God and in the accomplishments contained in the testimony
For us to believe in the Son of God and in what He has accomplished, we must believe the words of God's testimony
Believing in the Lord Jesus is not according to human imagination, presumption, and tradition but according to God's testimony
We do not believe in a Savior of our imagination, presumption, and tradition but in the Savior of whom God has borne testimony
God witnesses in His Word, the Bible, that His Son has already accomplished the work of salvation and life-impartation
The only thing that is required of man is to receive God's Son and His accomplishments, according to God's witness and words
One who desires to believe in the Lord Jesus must believe in the Scriptures, for the Scriptures testify concerning Him
Once we believe, God forgives us and washes us from our sins thereby solving the problems that existed between us and Him
Forgiveness, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation solve the problems between us and God outwardly
Once we believe, we are regenerated and obtain the life of God, and God gives us the Holy Spirit to dwell in us
Once we believe, all our inward and outward problems are resolved, and we obtain God's life and the Holy Spirit
Beginning in chapter 6, we will study each item separately, except for the eighth item, the Holy Spirit, which we discussed in chapter 4
The first aspect of God's salvation is forgiveness, which is also the first blessing that a person receives upon believing
Our sins before God must be canceled before the righteous God can come and apply other aspects of His salvation to us
The first meaning of forgiveness relates to the abolishment of our sinful record before God, which spares us from God's righteous judgment
After God caused the Lord Jesus to be judged and punished for us by bearing our sins on the cross, our sins were forever heaped upon Satan
When the high priest made expiation for the children of Israel, he took two goats and presented them before the Lord
For Azazel means 'for Satan' because Azazel stands opposite to God, and only Satan stands in such a position before God
Only God possesses the position and authority to forgive sins because only He has the position and authority to judge
No one other than God possesses this position and authority because man is not the lord of the universe and is sinful
Although only God possesses the authority to forgive sins, and although the Lord Jesus was a man, He was God incarnated on the earth
The blood of the Lord Jesus, which was shed in His death according to God's righteousness, satisfied the requirement of God's righteousness
Neither repenting nor believing is the basis upon which God forgives sinners; they are only the means to obtain forgiveness
Repenting and believing are not the result of an effort on the part of a sinner for which he is forgiven by God
The Lord Jesus' accomplished work on the cross enables God to forgive sinners and enables sinners to receive God's forgiveness
The way for sinners to be forgiven of their sins is to believe, and the way for believers to be forgiven of their sins is to confess
Since a believer has believed, he needs only to confess, that is, to confess his sins in order for God to forgive Him
Just as it is impossible for sinners to confess without believing, believers cannot believe without confessing
In order for a sinner to obtain peace through forgiveness, he must believe that God forgives his sins because of the blood of the Lord Jesus
In order for a believer to obtain restoration through forgiveness, he must confess his sins and iniquities to God
God's forgiveness not only causes people to fear Him and to not sin, but it also causes people to love Him and please Him
God's forgiving grace can deliver man from all the sins that the law with its condemnation cannot deliver man from
If we confuse them with one another, we will be perplexed and unable to understand the truth concerning forgiveness in the Bible
God's eternal forgiveness to sinners is not only because of the blood of Christ but also because of the sinner's believing
Since it is related to the fellowship between a believer and God, this forgiveness is given to a believer in this age
The forgiveness through which God restores fellowship with a believer is also granted because of the Lord's blood
Once a sinner obtains God's eternal forgiveness through believing, he is saved and has a spiritual fellowship of life with God
Some sins committed by God's children are concluded without any painful consequences after they are confessed and forgiven
Although he was a man according to Gods heart and was loved by God he committed a gross sin that is David murdered Uriah and took his wife
Although he was rebuked by God, confessed his sin to God, and was forgiven by God, discipline still followed forgiveness
David killed one, and God caused four members of his family to die, even as David himself once spoke, saying, 'Restore
A person's sins not only create a sinful record before God but also cause him to suffer the consequences of sin
The sins that a person commits might be forgiven by God, but he might not be spared from the sufferings that result from them
In Matthew 18 the Lord spoke of a believer who did not forgive from the heart his brother who had offended him
If a believer sins after being saved, he can be forgiven and chastised by God for some sins in this age, that is, today
In these two portions of the Word, the Lord clearly shows that the church may loose people on the earth, that is, forgive them
The church's loosing and forgiving on the earth are simply a declaration of God's loosing and forgiving in heaven
Regarding the matter of forgiving a person, the church should be strict but should also exercise adequate love
Otherwise, Satan will utilize this opportunity to damage a repenting brother, who has been removed by the church, thus damaging the church
He also spoke of the punishment in the millennial kingdom to warn us to take heed to the matter of forgiving others
He spoke seriously both of pleasing God today by forgiving others and of not escaping punishment in the kingdom if we do not forgive others
Charles Spurgeon once said that the forgiveness of some is like burying a dead dog but leaving its tail above the ground
Although we may have forgiven someone, we still remember his wrongdoing, and we even tell others about the offense
Failure to forgive others will not cause believers to perish eternally, but it may cause them to be punished in the millennial kingdom
If we do not forgive others today, the Lord will not forgive us in the coming kingdom until we forgive them from our heart
Although we are now exempt from the responsibility of the debts, the trace of the debts may still be in our record
Man's sin has not only made him a sinner with a record of sin before God, but it has also defiled and dirtied him
There is no one who cleanses his own heart and purifies himself from his sin after his heart has been defiled by sin
If a man were to thoroughly inspect all the members of his body, would any part not be a slave to uncleanness or not be defiled by sin?
Man not only has a heart that is full of defilement and a mouth that speaks filthiness; he also works uncleanness
Since the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to accomplish redemption His blood cleanses away all mans defilement that results from sin
After the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to accomplish the cleansing of man's sins, He sat down at the right hand of God on high
The cleansing we experienced when we were saved is the very cleansing that the Lord Jesus accomplished and that God applied to us
The first aspect is the cleansing of the blood, the second is the cleansing of life, and the third is the cleansing of baptism
Comparatively speaking, this aspect of the cleansing of the blood is outward, objective, and stresses what occurs before God
When we become one with the Lord by faith, His name causes us to share in the cleansing of His redeeming blood
Our conscience is the most vital part of our spirit, and our spirit is the very faculty with which we contact God
There is not only the aspect of the blood but also the aspect of life in the cleansing that God has prepared for us in His salvation
That is, He replaces our old stony heart, which is incurable and full of various kinds of defilement , with a pure and pliable new heart
Originally, because of our rebellion against God, every part of our soul, whether the mind, the emotion, or the will, was defiled
When we were sinners, there were improper things in every part of our being, and there was filthiness that was opposed to God
God cleanses us by His word through His truth and with His Spirit and life to make us a particular people as His unique possession
The blood washes away all our ungodly and unrighteous defilement before God through its effectiveness in making propitiation
When we believe and are saved God also through a particular means cleanses away the dirtiness of our sin in the eyes of men and before men
These words were spoken by Ananias, who was sent by God to Saul after Saul met the Lord on his way to Damascus
On the other hand, we need the Lord's blood to cleanse away our trespasses instantly to restore our cleanness before God
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
If we are defiled by sin-unrighteousness-after our salvation, we must confess our sins to God, who will forgive us and restore our cleanness
Although our works may be contaminated by sin after we are saved, we can wash them and make them white by the Lord's blood
Both in the Old Testament Hebrew and in the New Testament Greek, the emphasis in the meaning of sanctification is separation
Gold is not holy, but it becomes sanctified once it is put in the temple because the temple separates it unto God
Food is not holy, yet it is sanctified by the prayer of the saints because the prayer separates it for the saints of God
Animals, gold, and food are in the world, belong to the world, and are for the world; hence, they are common rather than holy
The altar sets apart some bulls and goats, the temple sets apart some gold, and the prayers of the saints set apart some food
These things become sanctified and holy because they have been separated unto God to be directly or indirectly for God
A person may behave very properly and uprightly and appear blameless and perfect before men, but he is still common rather than holy
Sanctification separates people not only from evil defilement but also from what is common so that they may be holy
Negatively, to be sanctified means to be separated from all that is apart from God; positively, it means to be consecrated to God
After we pray and spend time with the Lord, His life causes us to be different from our colleagues and schoolmates
While they spend their time in amusements and recreation, something mysterious within tells us to leave and not be with them
In this way God causes us to put off all that does not agree with His holy nature so that we may live in this nature to be holy
Brothers and sisters, in God's way of salvation there are no laws and regulations charging us how to conduct ourselves and how to dress
In Gods salvation there is only a precious life which is Christ whose nature matches Gods holiness and whose very taste is Gods holiness
The holy nature within corresponds with the holy light without, and the holy guidance without activates the holy taste within
If we read the Bible often, the truth in it will enlighten and show us what agrees with God's holy nature and what is contrary to it
The Holy Spirit strengthens the requirement of the holy life within us and makes the light of the holy truth outside of us to shine brighter
He also enables us to answer the demand of the holy life within and to obey the shining of the holy truth without
These three-the life of Christ, the light of the Bible, and the power of the Spirit-are like a threefold cord, sanctifying us completely
The Holy Spirit always inspires us according to the sense of life and the light of the Word, making us one with God's holy nature
Through His life, He causes us to sense, and through the Bible, He causes us to see what does and does not agree with God
The sanctification that we obtain in God's salvation may be divided into two aspects-positional and experiential
When Christ gave His body on the cross as a sin offering to redeem us and to sanctify us, He sanctified us forever
When we go to shop for a piece of clothing, the moment we pay for a certain item, it becomes separated from all the others
When we were redeemed by the Lord's blood, we immediately obtained the fact of sanctification, the position of sanctification
Once we believe in the Lord, His name enables us to share in His accomplishments, that is, His sanctifying redemption
Not only were Paul and Peter saints, but all of us who have been saved are saints because we have been called to be holy unto God
On the other hand, it supplies us with a holy life and holy nature that we may have a holy essence-holiness itself-and ability
It enables us to desire holiness, to understand holy matters, that is, the reality of holiness, and to live in the reality of holiness
Although we obtained the fact and position of sanctification upon believing the experience of sanctification occurs only after our salvation
To pursue sanctification means to pursue the holy life within or, we may say, to pursue the sense of holiness according to the life within
Inwardly, the Lord requires us to be holy, leads us to be holy, and gives us a sensation of holiness and an inclination toward holiness
Sanctification stresses the need to be separated to God from all that is apart from God in order to be holy unto God
Gods chastisement delivers us from the unholy matters that we are reluctant to forsake so that we can partake bountifully of His holy nature
If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master'
We should put off all that is outside of God and be sanctified to be a vessel unto honor, useful to the Master
To be sanctified wholly is to have our spirit, soul, and body separated from all that is apart from God to be holy unto Him
Sanctification causes us to be according to God's nature, and justification makes us right according to His procedure
God accomplished everything for us so that we might be justified freely without any effort or doing on our part; this is grace
Since the Lord's death and blood fulfilled all God's righteous requirements, God raised Him from the dead for our justification
Since the Lord's blood satisfied all God's righteous requirements, the Lord's resurrection causes us to be justified and accepted before God
The Bible definitely tells us that man's justification before God is not, and cannot be, by works; it is only by faith
If we do not believe, we will have no share in Him and what He did, and we will not obtain God's justification through His redemption
We must believe, being one with Him by faith, believing into Him, and receiving Him and what He has done for us by faith
His name causes us to be justified in name and position, and the Spirit of God causes us to experience God's justification in reality
We are not only justified by the Lord's blood, by His resurrection, and in His name but we are also justified in Him
If we are not in Him, the Lord's blood, the Lord's resurrection, and the Lord's name have nothing to do with us
We can partake of Him, His blood, His resurrection, and His name because we are joined to the Lord and have entered into Him by faith
Our justification is free because of the grace of God, which comes through the Lord's redemption by His blood and which is in Him
Faith caused us to be justified by God at the time of our salvation; works cause us to be justified by men after our salvation
After our salvation, we should live a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit to serve Christ
If we do, we will not only be well pleasing to God but also approved by men, that is, justified by men and before men
Many sisters do not shine out the light of life before their husbands, so they are not approved by their husbands
In many places in the books of Romans, Galatians, and Philippians, Paul clearly and definitely states that he was justified before God
Our life and work, our being and doing, determine whether we will be justified by the Lord when He comes to judge the saints
The Lord will judge us and decide whether we are righteous according to our work, action, thought, and counsel
The judgment seat of Christ is related to whether the saints should be rewarded or punished; it does not concern our salvation
According to the original Greek language, to be reconciled to God means that we have a complete change before God
Since man is at enmity against God, he is not subject to the law of God; he cannot be subject to the law even if he so desires
When man rebelled against God, he inherited a rebellious nature that keeps him from being subject to the law of God
Since man deliberately refuses knowledge of God, sets Him aside, and rejects Him, man needs to be reconciled to Him
Because of the above conditions, man is a son of disobedience before God, rebelling against God and resisting God
God, who has never had a problem with man and does not need to be reconciled to man, wants man to be reconciled to Him
God reconciled man and creation, both of which were at odds with Him, to Himself through the cross of the Lord Jesus
God did not come to reconcile us to Himself at the time of our repentance and seeking; rather, He came when we were His enemies
Although there is a sequence to God's reconciliation, forgiveness, and justification, we receive these items simultaneously when we believe
After believing in the Lord, the problems between us and God do not exist and we are reconciled to Him; therefore, we have peace toward God
Originally, God was man's joy, but once we developed a problem with God and lost God, we were godless and without any peace and joy
The very love through which God reconciled us to Himself constrains us in our heart to serve Him until the Lord returns
God forgives us, cleanses us, sanctifies us, justifies us, and reconciles us to Himself so that He can regenerate us
Man assumes that he would be free from all problems if he only received the forgiveness of sins and was justified before God
The Lord Jesus said that we must be born anew because unless we are born anew, we cannot see the kingdom of God
In order for man who belongs to a lower realm to understand the things of Gods higher realm he must obtain the life of Gods higher realm
In order for man in the human sphere to enter into the kingdom of God or the sphere of God, he must have the life of God
It is not the life of God, it does not have the function of God's life, and it cannot understand or do the things of God
It does not matter how we feel about our own life; in actuality, our life is of the flesh and comes from the flesh
In the Bible, God uses two unchangeable things, the skin of a Cushite and the spots of a leopard, to illustrate how man cannot be changed
In essence, God is saying that if these two things could be changed, the flesh of man, or the man of flesh, could also be changed
Although he understood the meaning of the word regeneration, he misunderstood the significance of regeneration
Although literally speaking regeneration is a rebirth the significance of regeneration is not about entering a mothers womb to be born again
In John 33 the word anew is synonymous with from above in verse 31 therefore to be born anew also has the meaning of being born from above
When Nicodemus heard Him speak of regeneration, he thought that he had to go back into his mother's womb and be born again
Why should we think that the water spoken of here is more than just water; that is, what is the basis for interpreting it as the word?
We should not interpret Spirit literally in the second part of the verse and interpret water spiritually in the first part of the verse
The life we obtain in regeneration is just the Spirit because in regeneration we obtain God's spiritual life from God's Spirit
Just as the wind can be felt without being seen, the life from God's Spirit in regeneration has a power that can be felt without being seen
When God regenerates us, He takes away our heart of stone and gives us a pliable new heart, one that is soft as flesh
Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
Without His death, God's life would have remained only in Him, the unique grain of wheat, and would not have been released
When He died, He released the life of God that was hidden in Him into us, giving us His life and making us the many grains
The Lord's death and resurrection accomplished redemption and everything for us so that we would be regenerated
While the Lord Jesus accomplished the fact of our regeneration, the Holy Spirit causes us to experience regeneration
As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten
In addition to the redemption of the Lord and the work of the Holy Spirit there is also the need for believing before one can be regenerated
The Lord accomplished redemption and the Holy Spirit is operating, but if man refuses to believe, he will not be regenerated
Regeneration causes us to obtain the life of God, to have the authority to become children of God, and to partake of the divine nature
The new heart gives us new likes and preferences; the new spirit gives us new spiritual abilities and fellowship
In the past, we did not like or prefer the things of God, and we did not fellowship with God or understand and practice the things of God
We had no heart for or interest in the things of God; we even felt strange, disoriented, and weak when we touched them
We have a heart for and an interest in these things, we are able to understand them, and we have the strength and ability to practice them
Regeneration not only gives us a new life, a new nature, a new heart, and a new spirit, but it also makes us a new creation
In the past we were the old creation, stained by sin and corrupted by Satan; now we are the new creation with God's holy nature and reality
Although we are still in the world and have not yet obtained the heavenly, better inheritance, we already have the heavenly life
God placed many words in the Bible which assuredly tell us that we have eternal life and are regenerated as soon as we believe into His Son
In addition to the Holy Spirit within and the Bible without, the love we have for our brothers in the Lord confirms that we are regenerated
Because we ourselves were begotten of God, we spontaneously love the brothers who also have been begotten of God
In the past, there was a young black slave in America who heard the gospel and was very joyful when she heard this Bible verse
She replied that she was in the Lord's hand, and the Lord's hand was so powerful that no one could snatch her away
After we are regenerated, we not only have the Lord's powerful hand keeping us, but we also have the Father's powerful hand keeping us
If we do not differentiate between these three periods in our examination of what the Bible says about eternal life, we will not be clear
God is eternal, without beginning and without end, so His life is also eternal, without beginning and without end
The Son of God is God incarnated, God Himself embodied in His Son; therefore, the life of God is also in His Son
Many think that even though we believe in the Lord now, we do not obtain eternal life until some time in the future
We have the eternal life of God to uphold us inwardly, and we have the Lord's and the Father's hands to protect us outwardly
The Lord promised that if we leave everything for His sake and for the gospel's sake, we will obtain eternal life in the coming age
Believing does not require anyone to pay a price, but in these verses the requirement to leave everything is an extremely high price
Previously we gained eternal life by believing but in these verses we will obtain eternal life in the coming age only if we leave everything
The Lord ordained the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom as a reward to those who leave everything for His sake today
The glory of reigning in life is given to those who are faithful unto death; it is bought at the price of being faithful unto death
In 2:7 the Lord promised that to eat of the fruit of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem would be a reward to the overcoming believers
To have a foretaste of the fruit of the tree of life is to have an early enjoyment of the blessing of eternal life
Enjoying eternal life in the coming age is different from obtaining eternal life in the present age and enjoying eternal life in eternity
According to the Lord's promise in Revelation 3:5, the names of the overcoming believers will not be erased from the book of life
The full blessing of God's salvation is the coming New Jerusalem, which is given to all the saved ones for their enjoyment in eternity
All those who have the Lord's eternal life and whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life will participate in this blessing
All the saved ones will enjoy the blessings of eternal life in the New Jerusalem, and one of these blessings will be the water of life
Every worldly person, no matter how high his education, how high his social position, or how good his behavior, is a person under bondage
People under sin are slaves of sin; they are controlled by sin and mastered by sin to the extent that they have no control over their sins
People think that sin is merely a wrong action or bad behavior, but the Bible speaks of sin as a living thing within man
Just as slaves must obey their masters, people under the control of sin cannot control themselves in the matter of committing sins
They themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been defeated, by this one he has been enslaved'
Corrupt things, such as eating, drinking, womanizing, gambling, and smoking, control countless people and cause them to lose their freedom
He acts upon them like a doctor operating on patients under anesthesia, having no control over the doctor's hand
Today man has been caught alive by the devil and is trapped in his snare, having no freedom and ability to free himself
Because of man's fear of death, he often voluntarily gives up his freedom, doing many things that bring him into bondage
The anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches are worries and bondages from which it is difficult to be released
Many are plagued with anxieties and cannot rise above them; many others are deceived by riches and cannot overcome them
The Lord shed His blood to redeem us from our sins cleansing us and releasing us from our sins so that we no longer have the problem of sins
All the troubles that come to us from our sins were resolved by the Lord's blood, which has released us from them
We were drowning in sin and could not rescue ourselves; the Lord came to save us from our sins, making us free and happy
God tells us in His Word, the Bible, that our sinful old man with its sins has been crucified with Christ and has died with Christ
He will stop trying to keep God's law by himself, and instead, he will enjoy the grace of God by the Lord's life
In the past, the law of sin and of death was a spontaneous power within us, preventing us from escaping sin and death
No condemnation does not refer to having our sins forgiven but to being freed from sin; that is, there is no condemnation within ourselves
In the past, we condemned ourselves because we could not overcome the law of sin; instead, we were continually captured by sin to do evil
Since the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin, we are no longer overcome by sin and no longer condemn ourselves
He paid the entire price required by the law, redeeming us out from under the law and releasing us from the condemnation of the law
Because we died together with Him, we have been released from the control of the law and are no longer responsible to it
He made us live together with Him in resurrection, giving us His life and enabling us to live under God's grace
God came and called us to receive His salvation and thus released us from the bondage of the law and gave us freedom
Before a person is saved, he does not have the Spirit of the Lord; consequently, he is under the bondage of the letter of the law
He also transferred us into His own kingdom of light, making us His children of light who enjoy freedom in the light
The present evil age is the part of the world that is before our eyes; it is used by Satan to seduce, cheat, and control people
Satan, through human wisdom and cleverness, invented the religions, ordinances, and philosophies in the world to keep men in bondage
When the Lord saved us with the life of God, we were delivered from the corruption which is in the world by lust
As we continue to love God, we will become even more fearless and bold because we will escape the suffering from fear
Once we come to the Lord and receive Him as our Savior, He takes our burdens and gives us rest to comfort our souls
Worldly people do not have God as their support and satisfaction, so they are greedy for countless things in their lives
In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
Even though our spirit has been regenerated to become part of the new creation, our outward body is still part of the old creation
Many times our body becomes weak, sick, crippled, and aged, so it brings us into bondage from which we cannot be freed
The glorious freedom of the new creation that God has prepared for us has not been seen or heard or even come up in man's heart
Although today we have the life of the Son of God and have become sons of God, we will not obtain the sonship of God until the Lord's return
The release we obtain in the Lord's salvation is a freedom, but this freedom does not imply looseness; it is a regulated freedom
Beware lest somehow this right of yours become a stumbling block to the weak ones'; 'Why is my freedom judged by some other conscience'?
We who were saved by the Lord are absolutely free and have no regulations or religious ordinances restricting us
Although we are free in the Lord and are able to do many things, not all things build up others and some things may even stumble others
If we love the Lord and the brothers and sisters, there should be many things that we would not do for the sake of the brothers and sisters
The Lord's salvation makes people free, but those who have obtained the Lord's salvation are willing to be restricted by the Lord
Although he received the Lord's salvation, was delivered from the bondage of the law, and had obtained freedom, he was not loose before God
The normal condition of those who have received grace and are saved is that they are not loose, even though they are free
The more we keep the commandments and teachings in the Lord's Word, the more our new inward nature feels comfortable and free
By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast'
The source of our eternal salvation is the grace that comes from God's love; in other words, grace issues in our eternal salvation
Since our eternal salvation does not come from ourselves or our works, no one can boast; it is the gift of God
Since God's grace is the source of our eternal salvation, we can only praise Him for His grace and give glory to Him
The source of our eternal salvation is God's grace, and the foundation of our eternal salvation is the Lord Jesus Himself
There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
Although the Lord's grace comes to save us, our faith causes the Lord's grace to come upon us and to be efficacious in us
To believe is to believe in one's heart that Jesus is the Savior, and to confess is to confess with the mouth that Jesus is Lord
If we want a thorough salvation before both God and man, we must believe with our heart and confess with our mouth
There are many elements to the Lord's salvation; some are received by faith, and some are obtained through baptism
Inside the ark they also passed through the flood and were saved by the flood from the corrupt generation that rebelled against God
Faith, calling, confessing, and baptism are four interconnected matters constituting the complete way to receive the Lord's salvation
When we were baptized into the Lord's death, being buried together with Him, we were also saved from the world
A person who is saved by faith should not only be assured inwardly of his salvation but also testify outwardly of his salvation
Baptism is the way to obtain the Lord's full salvation; it is also a testimony that one has obtained the Lord's salvation
When one is baptized, he receives the Lord's full salvation and testifies that he has obtained the Lord's salvation
He testifies that his sins were washed away by the Lord, that he is joined to the Lord, and that he has died together with the Lord
When the prodigal son returned home and tasted the great love of his father, he could not refrain from rejoicing together with his father
When someone encounters the Lord and is saved, he gains the Lord's life through the Spirit's entering into and abiding in him
We ourselves and our works can change and are not reliable, but the Lord and His work will not change and are eternally reliable
The Lord did not save us because of things that we have done, and He will not take away His salvation because of things that we will do
There is no such sentence in the original language of the entire New Testament, and there is no such thought in the Bible
Our living out of salvation is by obedience, and we must be in fear and trembling daily, even moment by moment, to work this out
After we are saved, our willing and our working are according to the operation of God within us for the accomplishment of His good pleasure
He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them'
The Lord as our interceding Priest gives us a daily, instant salvation that saves us every day and solves our daily problems
The Lord's daily salvation with respect to time saves us to the end and with respect to extent saves us to the uttermost
He attacks and attempts to ensnare us; therefore, we need the Lord to deliver us from the evil one every hour of every day
Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us'
Although Paul encountered persecution from men and was imprisoned for the Lord's sake, the Lord delivered him out of 'the lion's mouth'
It cannot refer to eternal salvation because we obtained this salvation when our spirit was enlivened the moment we believed
At that time, the Lord will transfigure our body, using His great power to transfigure the body of our humiliation into a glorious body
Salvation in these verses comes from losing our soul-life; it is obtained by our willingness to pay the price of sacrificing our soul
Eternal salvation is related to the enlivening of our spirit, whereas the salvation spoken of here is related to finding the soul-life
According to the New Testament, this reward is our entrance into the millennial kingdom and our enjoyment of the joy of our Lord
All the ridicule, persecution, and harm that we receive from others because we believe, serve, and follow the Lord cause our soul to suffer
If we do not love and follow the Lord because we want to avoid these sufferings, we will save our soul-life and avoid them
If we are willing to deny our self, to put the self to death without saving it, we will lose, rather than save, our soul-life
If we are willing to do this today, we will experience the Lord's life in our spirit and enjoy the joy of the Lord in our soul in the future
In the future, when we enjoy the joy of the Lord in our soul, we will find our soul-life and obtain the salvation of our soul
Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls'
He believed that the Lord would save him into His heavenly kingdom and cause his soul to enjoy the Lord's joy there
Once we believe in Christ and are joined to Him by faith, He sets us free, releasing us from the curse and bondage of the law
When we believe and receive the Lord who died and resurrected, God regenerates us by putting His life into our spirit by His Spirit
He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life'
As soon as we believe, we have eternal life; we do not come into judgment or condemnation, and we pass out of death into life
When we hear the Lord's word, the gospel, and believe it, we have eternal life and do not have to wait until the future to obtain it
At the time of believing, one has eternal life, does not come into judgment, and passes out of death into life
Once we believe, having eternal life, not coming into judgment, and passing out of death into life are not matters in the future
Many think that salvation is something in the future, so they think that there is no way for them to know whether they are saved now
Some even go so far as to suggest that it is impossible for us to know whether we have eternal life in the present
They say that we can and should have faith in the present, but to know whether we have eternal life is something that is impossible
Since we are saved and have God's life, we can know this fact now, by His life working in us and by the Holy Spirit whom He gave us
Because we know that we have obtained God's life and have been born of God, we also know that we are children of God
Some might say that Paul might have known that he was part of a heavenly commonwealth, but that we cannot know
John 1:12 says, 'As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
Romans 10:10 says, 'With the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation'
These passages in the Bible are not only revelations or promises that God has given to us; rather, they are a written covenant
The Lord made these words of His written covenant a testament for us so that we could inherit the blessings of His salvation
The person bequeathing an inheritance puts all of his inheritance into a will and testament and passes it on to his heirs
One inherits property according to clearly written provisions of a will and testament, not according to feelings or imaginations
With respect to the Bible as the outward proof, we do not need feelings, and we should not worry about whether we have any feelings
By the feeling in our spirit, by the clear word of the Bible, and by the fact of our loving heart, we can know that we are saved
Even if we do not remember the exact day of our salvation, the fact of our salvation can be known by these three proofs
If we know that we are saved, heavenly citizens, we will wait for the Lord's coming and for our being received into the heavens
Our living of awaiting the Lord comes from knowing that we are saved ones whose commonwealth is in the heavens
Since we know that we are saved, we know that we will be like Him when He returns because we will see Him as He is
Knowing we will see the Lord and be like Him causes us to live a life that is purified from sin, a holy life that is like the Lord's
Some think that it is impossible to know that we are saved; others think that we can still perish after we are saved
If our sonship was based on our condition, it would not be secure, because our condition constantly fluctuates
Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose'
The salvation and calling of God are according to His will and apart from our works; they have absolutely nothing to do with our behavior
Our salvation will not change even if our behavior changes; instead, it is eternally secure according to God's unchanging purpose
God's will is that all whom He has chosen and given to the Lord, according to His unchanging purpose, would not be lost
God's counsel cannot be changed; therefore, the salvation which God gives according to His counsel cannot be changed
God did not choose us accidentally or on the spur of the moment; He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world
Since God's calling is according to His unchanging person and unchanging purpose, He will not repent of it or change
Our salvation is not of ourselves or our works but by God's grace; this grace is the gift of God and is of God
If it were of ourselves or our works, it would be changeable; however, it is of God and His grace, so it will not change
Not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages'
God has saved us according to the grace that He gave us in Christ before the times of the ages, not according to our works
Emotions can change with a change of the heart, but judicial matters are principles that are eternally unchanging
If God came to save us merely by His love and grace, our salvation would merely be a matter of His willingness to save us
When we believe, His righteousness leaves Him no choice but to save us; it requires that He save us eternally and to the uttermost
When the Lord Jesus went to the cross and bore God's righteous judgment in our place, He satisfied the requirement of God's righteousness
Now God justifies those who believe in the Lord Jesus, according to His righteousness and with a view to demonstrating His righteousness
Since the Lord Jesus satisfied God's righteous requirements on our behalf, God must forgive and justify us according to His righteousness
Before the Lord Jesus resolved the problem of God's righteous condemnation of us, God could not have forgiven us without being unrighteous
After the Lord Jesus satisfied God's righteous requirements on our behalf, God would be unrighteous if He did not forgive and justify us
Formerly, if He justified us, He would have been unrighteous; now, if He does not justify us, He would be unrighteous
His righteousness cannot change; therefore, the justification that He gives us according to His righteousness cannot change
God saved us not only because of His love, by His grace, and according to His righteousness but also through His covenant
Since He saves us according to His established covenant, according to His word in the New Testament, our salvation cannot be changed
It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us'
Who can erase the eternal efficacy of the redemption of Christ's death and resurrection and make His intercession for us of no effect?
He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them'
In His Word God shows that once we are saved, we have eternal salvation, we are perfected forever, and we will never perish
