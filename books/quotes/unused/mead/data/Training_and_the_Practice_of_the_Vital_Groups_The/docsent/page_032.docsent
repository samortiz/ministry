   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL BEING A PATTERN TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may wonder how we could ever compare to the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:16 that he was saved as the top sinner to be a pattern to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that we should do what Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is no possibility for us to be like him, his word is in vain, and this verse should not be in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But he told us clearly that God has set him up as a pattern to all those who believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we are the believers in Christ, and we all can be like Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we be vital?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you begun to run?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If not, the vital groups are just vain talk among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I sympathize with many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I know that we may have difficult jobs with long hours, but we should not excuse ourselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On this whole earth, everyone is busy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to be like those in the Olympics.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must discipline ourselves, exercise self-control, and buffet our body to enslave and subdue it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not take this way to run, I do not believe the vital groups can be among us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The vital groups cannot be with those who are loose, lazy, or sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>PRACTICING TO CONTACT PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From now on we all have to run the race by practicing to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not an easy thing, because we do not have this habit and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to have a change in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we were born to be a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may have been born to be a certain way, but we have been born again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have had a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our being generated made us an old creation, but in regeneration God has made us a new creation, so we must be new persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After regeneration, we experience transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Transformation is not an outward correction or adjustment, but an inward, metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A number of us were born as persons who cannot contact people easily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this training requires us to have an inward change, a transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to pray, "Lord, grant me to have a change in contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I don't like to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I don't like to be invited by others to contact them, nor do I like to invite people to contact me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I don't have this kind of disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, You know I don't have this capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So You have to transform me, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to cooperate with the Lord to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would propose that from tomorrow morning you begin to contact people by using the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before you drive away from your home, you can make at least one phone call to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will begin to build you up with a habit to contact people, to know people, and to become interested in people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also need to contact people before and after the church meetings, especially the Lord's Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This can be the best time for us to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On Saturday we could call a certain brother and say to him, "Brother, I have seen you quite often, but I have not had a time to talk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How about we come to the meeting tomorrow half an hour earlier to have some fellowship for about twenty minutes?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of contact with the saints helps a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the Lord's Day morning meeting is also a good time to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have observed that many brothers and sisters contact only their familiar acquaintances after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do not go to contact the new ones in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the new ones are left as orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before the meeting and after the meeting we should create an intimate and loving atmosphere in the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the new ones come in, they should be able to sense the warm care and intimacy among us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A new one may not have even heard the gospel yet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He may not even have believed yet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But he will be impressed with the loving atmosphere, the intimate atmosphere, among the saints in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we contact the saints and the new ones in this way, it helps us to function in the meeting; it makes it easier for us to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose I come every Lord's Day morning, yet I do not contact anyone, and no one contacts me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then every face looks cold to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I stand up to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, it is difficult because the people seem so cold.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After speaking a little bit in such a cold atmosphere, it will be hard for me to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if everyone is so familiar to me, some will smile at me while I am sharing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their smiling tells me to "sail on" in my speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must have such an atmosphere in the church meeting, an atmosphere in which people know that we really love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are really a big, loving, intimate family with brothers, sisters, and parents.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some older ones are really our parents in the Lord Rom 16:13; 1 Cor 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No human being likes to be isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all like to be flocked together.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But in human society, where is a pure flock of people who love one another in an incorruptible way with much encouragement, building up, and help?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every human being would like to join such a group.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I feel that we are lacking the proper atmosphere in our church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to create such a loving atmosphere in our start of contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can make appointments with people for the Lord's Day morning meeting by calling them on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should try to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should also try to invite people to our home and be invited by others to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord's blessing will follow us if we practice this in a loving and intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a brother received a number of invitations every week, he might not be able to go, but these invitations would encourage him and make him buoyant.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord charged His people, His disciples, to love one another John 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He brought a group of Galileans together to follow Him every day for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They dropped their jobs and followed the Lord Jesus all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord blended them together.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the Acts and the Epistles, we can see that the early apostles also carried out the same kind of blending among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I am burdened to help us become blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can do this by three ways: by calling others on the telephone, by contacting others on the Lord's Day morning, and by inviting others to our home and being invited by others to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we invite others to our home, we do not have to prepare a rich feast.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should just prepare a simple meal.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are not getting together for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are coming together for blending.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we come together, we talk about the Lord Jesus, about His holy Word, and about our spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This kind of contact will revolutionize the church.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We will convert the church into a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the last message, we spoke of the Lord's need to have a new generation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This cannot take place merely by prayer but by our contacting of people.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You should contact me, I should contact you, and we all should contact one another every day, every week, every month, and every year.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we contact one another, we are meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To meet is to blend, and to blend is to know each other.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Whoever shepherds the Lord's flock should know every sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need to be trained to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If a brother is very cold toward the Lord, how can we make him burning?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We can invite him to our home or go to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>One day the Lord washed His disciples' feet to show them that He loved them to the uttermost John 13:1 , and He charged His disciples to do the same to one another in love vv.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>14, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Today, the world is dirty, and we, the saints, are easily contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>For us to maintain pleasant fellowship with the Lord and with one another, we need spiritual foot-washing with the washing Holy Spirit Titus 3:5 and the washing word Eph 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This can be carried out when we contact one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Our contact with people should not be formal and official but normal and living in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If certain saints are not coming to the church meetings, we can begin to visit them once a week or once a month in a regular way according to what their situation allows.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We can give them some copies of the gospel tracts we have published.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We can read a phrase or a paragraph to them.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Maybe this will stir them up and give them a desire to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>There are many ways to shepherd people.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>My point is this we need to build up a habit of contacting others.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should not be limited in our contact.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we have the burden to visit our relatives and acquaintances who are unbelievers, we should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We need to practice this one lesson to contact people.</S>
