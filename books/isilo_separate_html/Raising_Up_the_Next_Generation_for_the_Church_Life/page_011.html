<p>Anyone who has a vision today can be clear at a glance that neither Brother Nee nor I carried out our own personal work; our work is the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the building of the Body of Christ. I say this with the hope that you will be influenced by me. I was greatly influenced by Brother Nee, and I hope that you will also be influenced by him.</p>
<p>If we all do the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there will be the one Body. If only three or five people who are of the same mind go out to work in a small region, the outcome is not oneness or one accord; rather, that outcome creates division. This is the very reason for the turmoil in recent years.</p>
<p>If we look back, what did Brother Nee accomplish, and what have I accomplished? All that we have done is left here for the Lord to show grace to His children; the work that we have done is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I hope that we all can see this. We must see the Body of Christ and be very clear concerning this vision. This vision must become our governing and controlling vision. We must do the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery under this vision. The work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the work of His economy, the work of the Body of Christ. (<em>The Governing and Controlling Vision in the Bible,</em> pp. 32, 33)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>The church is the life of the Body in miniature; the ministry is the functioning of the Body in service; the work is the reaching out of the Body in growth. Neither church, ministry, nor work can exist as a thing by itself. Each has to derive its existence from, find its place in, and work for the good of the Body. All three are from the Body, in the Body, and for the Body. If this principle of relatedness to the Body and interrelatedness among its members is not recognized, there can be no church, no ministry, and no work. The importance of this principle cannot be over-emphasized, for without it everything is man-made, not God-created. The basic principle of the ministry is the Body. The basic principle of the work is the Body. The basic principle of the churches is the Body. The Body is the governing law of the life and work of the children of God today. (<em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> pp. 187-188)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we go on to see the reality of the Body of Christ. The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the resurrection. Brother Nee made a statement, saying that &ldquo;the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection; without the Holy Spirit, there is no resurrection.&rdquo; In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; He is not only the life but also the resurrection. However, most of us can understand that the Spirit is life, but we cannot comprehend that the Spirit is resurrection. The Lord Jesus said that He is the resurrection. What is this resurrection? This resurrection is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The work of the Triune God in us is to produce the Body of Christ, the reality of which is the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. This Spirit as the consummated Triune God, the resurrection, works in us. When we have the pneumatic Christ, the consummated Triune God, the resurrection, we are practically the Body of Christ. (<em>The High Peak of the Vision and the Reality of the Body of Christ,</em> p. 43)</p>
<h2 class="head1">WANTING TO CARRY OUT WITH HER BELOVED<br />
THE WORK THAT IS FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; / Let us lodge in the villages&rdquo; (S. S. 7:11). This reveals that she wants to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world by sojourning from one place to another. This indicates that she is not sectarian. In the Lord&rsquo;s work it is not easy to keep our work open, to not keep our work &ldquo;in our pocket.&rdquo; We must learn to keep the work open, so that others can come to sojourn there and we can go to sojourn elsewhere. This is to keep one work in one Body. (<em>Life-study of Song of Songs,</em> p. 59)</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CENTRAL WORK</h2>
<p>Today we have to see what God&rsquo;s work is, and we have to know what is God&rsquo;s central work in man. We must be led to see the way to receive God&rsquo;s life. After we receive this life, we should know how to live in this life, so that God can have a way among us. This is God&rsquo;s central work...What we need today is not peripheral works but God&rsquo;s central work. (<em>Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee&rsquo;s Ministry,</em> vol. 1, pp. 151-152)</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CENTRAL WORK&mdash;<br />
WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God. This fullness is the content. God&rsquo;s intention is to fill us with this content. Verse 20 shows us how God accomplishes this, that is, how He fills us with His fullness. The main work of God today is to work Himself into man. Unless our living, our walk, and our work are linked up with God&rsquo;s center, they will all pass away. Even the so-called blessings and peace will pass away. The only thing that will remain is God&rsquo;s work within us. I know that many will think that I am saying the wrong thing, and I know that many will misunderstand my words. But if a man loves the Lord with a pure heart, he will see the revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
