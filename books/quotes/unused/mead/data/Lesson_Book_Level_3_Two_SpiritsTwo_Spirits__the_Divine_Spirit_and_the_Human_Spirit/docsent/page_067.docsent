   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Praying Without Ceasing by Calling</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Paul charges us to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does it mean to pray unceasingly?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we may eat several meals a day and although we may drink many times during the day, no one can eat and drink without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we certainly breathe unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul's command to pray without ceasing implies that unceasing prayer is like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But how can our prayer become our spiritual breathing?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can we turn prayer into breathing?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way to do this is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to call on the Lord Jesus continually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the way to breathe, to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because we are not accustomed to this, we need to practice calling on the Lord's name all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To live is to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spiritually speaking, to breathe is to call on the Lord's name and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we breathe the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Pray-reading the Word</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have seen in Lesson Twelve, the Spirit is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to experience the supply of the Spirit in the Word we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Pray-reading is one of the best ways to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us use Psalm 133 to show the difference between analyzing the Bible and enjoying the nourishment contained in it by pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their time of personal devotions, some Christians may read Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As they read, they may begin to analyze and to ask about the precious ointment, the beard, the skirts, the dew, and Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of receiving the bountiful supply, they are left with many unanswered questions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we pray-read Psalm 133, we shall take this portion in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we pray-read, we may say, "Behold, amen!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How good and how pleasant, amen."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By taking the Word in this way, we shall apply the all-inclusive Spirit to our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By pray-reading we exercise our spirit to receive spiritual nourishment from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through this nourishment we grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are nourished with the words of faith and healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we take even as little as ten minutes to pray-read a portion of the Word, we shall receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, we shall experience the various elements of Christ's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, we must see that it is crucial to exercise our spirit in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we Christians come together in a church meeting, we need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to pray, praise, or give a word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is to exercise our spirit and not allow it to remain dormant or in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But sorry to say, many saints do not preserve their spirit by exercising it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, they allow their spirit to remain dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems that they leave their spirit in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When everyone exercises his spirit in a meeting, the Holy Spirit is free to move and flow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this is a real battle, for Satan knows that if we all release our spirits, he will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He subtly hits the strategic point of choking the spirit of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as he can choke our spirit, we are finished and he is successful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we must fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must learn to practice releasing our spirit all the time and be continually ready to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we come to a meeting, we must immediately exercise and release our spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All our problems are solved and all our needs are met through the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All that God is and all that He has accomplished are in the all-inclusive Spirit who has been installed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, by turning to our spirit and by exercising our spirit, we may obtain the full supply to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We believers must know how to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to exercise our spirit we must take care of our conscience by applying the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The unique way to exercise our spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can all pray without ceasing by calling on the name of the Lord continually.</S>
