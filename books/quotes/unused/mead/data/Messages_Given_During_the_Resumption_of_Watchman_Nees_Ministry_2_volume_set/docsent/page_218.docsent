   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Nature of the Lord's Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was staying in London, everything was set up by the host.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the morning, we woke up at six o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At noon we had our meal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At three o'clock in the afternoon, we had our afternoon tea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One Swiss brother from Japan was shaking his head and sighing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I asked why he was so unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was fifteen years older than I was, and he made tens of thousands of pounds every year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had a few thousand workers working under him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told me that he was having a hard time because he had not been a student for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the guest house where he was staying, the brother in charge was a rather uneducated person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was very unpleasant for this Swiss brother to come under that brother's supervision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I stayed in London for eighteen months.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I had not learned submission, but instead criticized and opposed, how could I have been happy within?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Submission is the nature of the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is for our protection to submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Learning Submission in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Christian ought to learn coordination, and coordination comes from submission.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A rebellious and independent person is one who will not be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christians ought to learn to submit one to another, and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only should a person have the realization of authority in the church and in the Body, but when he is alone, he should still have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, we learn submission first in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is rather difficult to learn submission outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is more natural to learn submission in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is God's protection; it keeps us from exposing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we learn the lesson this way, the spirit of antichrist will be removed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SUBMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning submission to our government, we know that no Christian can overturn any government.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If certain political factors are contrary to our faith, the most we can do is to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is like what the Lord says, that we escape from one city to another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible, to escape is not a shameful thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a government is not good, we can escape.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But at the same time, all Christians should still pray for the governments that are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee answered: We still have to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But under certain circumstances, there are laws which a Christian cannot keep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother D. M. Panton said once that if a law is itself unlawful, we do not have to consider whether or not to keep that law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrews to kill their male children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The midwives did not obey this order, yet the Bible says that God dealt well with the midwives Exo 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moses' mother did not obey the order of Pharaoh Exo 2:1-2 , yet Hebrews 11 praised her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason for this is that Pharaoh's law was itself a lawless order.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament, when Peter and John disobeyed the order of the high priest, they were acting under the same principle.</S>
