[1]  The Testimony and the Ground of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  Chapter Two: The Church s Function to Express Christ and to Testify of Christ
[3]  INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Matt 16:16-19; Eph 1:22-23; 3:9-11, 21; 4:11-12; 5:25-27; 1 Tim 3:15-16
[4]  Matthew 16:16-19 says, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[5]  And Jesus answered...upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
[6]  In these verses we need to pay attention to the Lord s speaking, Upon this rock I will build My church.
[7]  The building up of the church by the Lord, or we may say, the church that is being built up by the Lord, is related to two matters.
[8]  Ephesians 3:9-11 says, To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[9]  Ephesians 5:25-27 says, Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things.
[10]  God s great purpose in establishing and building up the church is to deal with His enemy, Satan, through the church.
[11]  SECTION ONE THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH CHAPTER ONE GOD S ETERNAL DESIRE
[12]  Since God s eternal purpose is to be expressed, all of the work that He has been doing throughout the ages has been for the fulfillment of His purpose; they are the steps in His expression of Himself in men and among men.
[13]  The stories from Adam to the New Jerusalem all show how God manifests Himself.
[14]  Each of the patriarchs bore some characteristics that expressed God.
[15]  For example, Abel characteristically testified to the people that God condemns sin and cannot accept sinful men without redemption, because He is holy and righteous Gen 4:4 .
[16]  In the garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword guarded the way to the tree of life 3:24 to prevent sinful man from contacting God in a loose and casual manner, like Cain.
[17]  A sinner can draw near to God only through the way of redemption established by God.
[18]  After the patriarchs, God manifested Himself in man among the people of Israel.
[19]  This was a great step in God s manifestation, and it contains numerous types and stories that express God.
[20]  Among the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, thirty-eight speak concerning this step in God s manifestation, showing the God who is among the people of Israel.
[21]  In the priests we see God s holiness, in the judges we see God s might, in the kings we see God s authority, and in the prophets we see God s wisdom and prudence.
[22]  The three steps in God s manifestations mentioned above are in the Old Testament.
[23]  We all know that Christ is the manifestation of God; He came to earth for the expression of God.
[24]  There are two great steps in the manifestation of God in the New Testament: The first step is seen in Christ, and the second step is seen in the church.
[25]  This does not mean that the church expresses God more than Christ; rather, the church is an enlarged expression of God.
[26]  In addition to saying that Christ is the mystery of God, the Bible also says that the church is the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4-6 .
[27]  God in Christ is the substance of the church, and the church in the Holy Spirit is the expression of God.
[28]  God in Christ is completely mingled with the church as one, and the church in Christ is completely transformed to be like God; at the same time, God in Christ completely shines out of the church and is expressed through the church.
[29]  We have seen that God s eternal intention is to express Himself in Christ.
[30]  Furthermore, the expression of God has been enlarged to be the church.
[31]  The church has been produced because the only begotten Son of God, who expressed God, has been enlarged to become the many sons of God.
[32]  Previously, the expression of God could be seen only in Christ, but now the expression of God has become a corporate expression.
[33]  If we know the expression of God, we will know the testimony of the church, the function of the church.
[34]  In the same way, Christ puts Himself into the church to be expressed through the church.
[35]  When the church expresses Christ, the church testifies of Christ in the universe.
[36]  The Ark in Exodus 40:21 of the Chinese Union Version is called the Ark of the Law, but it is actually the Ark of the Testimony according to the Hebrew text.
[37]  This is because the law of God was in the Ark. Since the law was the testimony, the Ark was called the Ark of the Testimony.
[38]  Just as the law is the word of God, the entire Bible is the word of God.
[39]  Furthermore, once we see Christ, we cannot help but see God, because the entire Bible is a testimony of God.
[40]  V. CHRIST BEING THE TESTIMONY OF GOD A. As the Living Word of God,
[41]  Revelation 1:5 and 3:14 show us that Christ is the testimony, that is, the testimony of God.
[42]  Christ is the testimony of God, and the Holy Spirit is the testimony of Christ.
[43]  When the Holy Spirit brought Christ into the believers and constituted them as the church, the church became the testimony of Jesus.
[44]  When the Holy Spirit wrought such a Christ into the church, the church lived out Christ.
[45]  The church testifies that Christ is altogether the mingling of God and man.
[46]  God is in man, and man lives in God.
[47]  God is mingled with man, and man is also mingled with God.
[48]  Sin, death, the world, idols, Satan s authority, his kingdom, and his own self, have no place in the church.
[49]  The church was filled with God s presence; within it there was nothing of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, or the authority and kingdom of Satan.
[50]  The early church was a complete and full testimony of Christ, manifesting Christ before the people and completely living out Christ.
[51]  Only when the church gives ground to the Spirit, depends on the Spirit, follows the Spirit, and obeys the ruling of the Spirit can the Spirit testify concerning Christ in the church.
[52]  John 13:35 and 17:21 and 23 show that it is easy for men to recognize Christ and to see the kind of person He is when the church testifies of Him, that is, when the church is completely one with Christ and when all the saints are completely one in Him.
[53]  If the Lord grants us His visitation, we will see that in the last days of this age among the Lord s children, the Lord s desire is to recover the church as a living testimony, as a testimony for the expression of Christ and of God, and as a testimony of the complete union of God with man.
[54]  The production, existence, relationship, and issue of the testimony of the church are shown in Matthew 16:13 through 17:8.
[55]  The church is clearly spoken of in the Bible beginning in Matthew 16.
[56]  Although many persons typify the church in the Old Testament, there was no mention of the church in plain words.
[57]  It was not until the Lord Jesus came in the flesh and worked on earth for nearly three years that He revealed the church in plain words.
[58]  Then the Lord asked, But you, who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Peter, who was the disciple who usually rushed to speak, answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Although Peter often was the first to speak, he did not speak from himself this time; rather, God gave him a revelation which enabled him to see things incomprehensible to men.
[59]  THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH A. Living in Christ Being Joined to Christ
[60]  Please note the words of the Lord: Upon this rock I will build My church.
[61]  The church being built upon this rock means that the church exists upon this rock.
[62]  If the brothers and sisters are not living in Christ, not joined to Christ, and not holding Christ, the testimony of the church will be very weak.
[63]  Therefore, the existence of the testimony of the church depends completely upon the church being joined to Christ.
[64]  This means that Hades affects the church in many ways.
[65]  In the early stage of the church, the gates of Hades utilized the Jewish religion, the Roman Empire, and Greek culture, uniting these three great powers to affect the church.
[66]  Moreover, after the Lord Jesus began to build the church, these three groups the Jews, the Romans, and the Greeks joined together to deal with the church.
[67]  Since the church is built upon the resurrected and victorious Christ, it cannot be defeated by the gates of Hades.
[68]  The church is able to do this because it is joined to the Christ who overcame Hades and Satan and because it bears the testimony of Christ s victory.
[69]  It is impossible for the testimony of the church to be destroyed by the gates of Hades; the testimony of the church will always deal with and overcome the gates of Hades.
[70]  Whenever and wherever there is a group of people standing in the position of the church and manifesting the reality of the church, that is, the testimony of the church, the gates of Hades will be affected, and the kingdom of the heavens will be involved.
[71]  The most important is the Lord s mention of the church.
[72]  In order to have the church, that is, to have the building of the church, He spoke of several related matters: 1 the gates of Hades, 2 the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, 3 Satan, 4 the cross, 5 the will of men, and 6 the will of God.
[73]  In Matthew 16:18, build and church are important words: You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church.
[74]  In addition, 1 Peter 2:4-5 says, Coming to Him, a living stone,... you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.
[75]  As saved ones, we all admit that once we were clay but that we have become stones because of the Lord s salvation.
[76]  At the end of this section, we need to consider the nature of the testimony of the church.
[77]  According to biblical revelation, the nature of the testimony of the church consists of at least six important items.
[78]  First, the nature of the testimony of the church is of revelation; it is not natural nor idealistic nor of human thought.
[79]  Now we will begin to consider the matter of the ground of the church.
[80]  Everything created by God has two aspects: an inward aspect and an outward aspect.
[81]  Just as the Bible shows us the content of the church, it also shows us the appearance of the church.
[82]  We must admit that those who love and pursue the Lord do not have much problem with the content of the church, but they have many problems related to the ground of the church.
[83]  Throughout the ages among those who love the Lord, the problems that have arisen concerning the church were seldom related to the content or the testimony of the church; rather, almost all of them have been related to the outward appearance or the ground of the church.
[84]  If the children of God could properly deal with the ground of the church, there would be almost no problems related to the church.
[85]  As we consider the ground of the church, the first thing we need to see is the oneness of the church, which is what we ordinarily refer to as the unity of the church.
[86]  I. THE ESSENCE OF THE ONENESS A. Being the Spirit Himself
[87]  In Ephesians 4:3, this oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit.
[88]  In Ephesians 4:3 the apostle not only speaks of the oneness of the Spirit, but he goes on to speak of seven ones in verses 4 through 6.
[89]  If we carefully study these seven ones, we can see that they are divided into one group of four and another group of three.
[90]  The seven ones of the church spoken of here convey, to a large extent, the meaning of completion.
[91]  Man alone on earth cannot be the church, nor can God alone in heaven be the church.
[92]  In addition, there are three other ones one hope, one faith, and one baptism.
[93]  As those who have been saved by grace, those who are the church, we may have different opinions, yet we share the same hope.
[94]  These seven ones one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Body, one faith, one baptism, and one hope are the reality of the oneness of the church, the base of the oneness of the church.
[95]  Since we have looked at the essence and the reality of the oneness of the church, we need to look at the indivisibility of the oneness of the church.
[96]  In the New Testament there are many portions which emphatically speak of the church being one, which cannot and should not be divided.
[97]  We have clearly seen in the previous sections that the church is one; her nature, that is, the Triune God, is one the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Body.
[98]  Therefore, no matter what reason a person uses to divide the church, it is an offense to God, and it is condemned by God.
[99]  God says that the church is one, but men insist on making the church many.
[100]  If the church was in oneness, without division, if it was a testimony of oneness, the dwelling place of God and the Body of Christ, in which there is one Spirit, in whom is the one Son, in whom is the one Father, that is, in which the entire Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwells, then the gospel preaching of the church would be altogether different.
[101]  Anyone who is fair and reasonable would shake his head and say, No, they do not have the ground of the church, the nature of the church, or the content of the church.
[102]  Looking to spiritual giants is the first basis for dividing the church 1 Cor 1:12-15; 4:6 .
[103]  This is not something new; it is an ancient matter which existed even in the first century.
[104]  Some of the Corinthian believers who were for Paul said, We are of Paul; we were saved through Paul s gospel preaching.
[105]  The third way of dividing the church is to consider oneself as being of Christ in order to separate from others 1 Cor 1:12-13 .
[106]  In the church in Corinth, there was another group of people who said, It is wrong for you to be of Paul, to be of Apollos, or to be of Cephas.
[107]  In the church there are people with all sorts of strange thoughts; furthermore, they all base their thoughts on the Bible.
[108]  When I was young, I met a group of Christians who said that the church should not love the world.
[109]  Doctrinal Differences but Not Permitting Us to Be Sectarian, Divisive, because of Such Differences
[110]  Many of the divisions of the church exist only because of different views that the believers have concerning the truth.
[111]  Today we should not be divided into a white church, a black church, or a yellow church.
[112]  We now will look at the fellowship of the church.
[113]  The fellowship of the church is a great matter in the Bible and something that we hear people speak of frequently.
[114]  Fellowship can mean many things, such as mutual dealings, mutual supply, mutual prayer, and mutual love; however, these things do not fully express the meaning of fellowship.
[115]  Although the fellowship of the church is manifested in every locality among Christians, it should not be of a local nature; rather, it should be universal.
[116]  Therefore, we must extend our local fellowship to the whole Body of Christ, which is the universal church.
[117]  Since we have looked at the oneness of the church and the fellowship of the church, we now need to look at the ground of the church.
[118]  Many people have been saved and have formed a church, but on what ground should the church stand?
[119]  When all those who have been saved come together, not having any division but being fully in oneness and fellowshipping in mutuality, then this oneness, this fellowship, is the ground of the church.
[120]  Therefore, to lose the oneness, the fellowship, of the church is to lose the ground of the church.
[121]  The sects and denominations today have lost the oneness of the church with their divisive condition and have also lost the ground of the church.
[122]  Now we need to look at the matter of sects.
[123]  If we want to have a thorough knowledge concerning the ground of the church, we also must have a clear understanding of the matter of sects.
[124]  This is a matter that is very closely related to the ground of the church.
[125]  If we carefully read through the New Testament under God s enlightening, we will clearly see that the eternal desire of God in the universe is to gain a church among men who have God Himself and thereby become a place for His dwelling and a means for His expression.
[126]  Using words that are understandable to us, we can say that God wants to gain a church to be His Body.
[127]  Of course, everyone has to admit that the situation of the division in the church today is absolutely wrong.
[128]  In your consideration, I say that the church should be one, yet I am not one with others; I say that the church should not be divided, yet I take the lead to be divided from others.
[129]  We must discern what ground is the ground of division and what ground is the ground of oneness, what ground is right and what ground is wrong.
[130]  If we have a clear discernment, we should forsake any ground that is wrong and return to the one ground, the right ground.
[131]  The second condition which constitutes a sect is having special articles of belief.
[132]  We have been saved and become a part of the church because of the one faith, the fundamental faith, spoken of in Ephesians 4:5.
[133]  The apostle Peter said that this is the equally precious faith allotted to each one of us 2 Pet 1:1 .
[134]  Another point we need to check is whether they have some background of Christian organization.
[135]  The church in any locality must be a pure local church and should not belong to any Christian organization.
[136]  Although a local church should have fellowship in Christ with the churches in other localities, it should not have an organizational relationship with any Christian organization.
[137]  This is the church I am in. When the other person heard this, because he thought that the brother was joking, he said, How could there be such a church? How could you and I be in the same church, since you and I have never met before? The brother said, Yes, you are in the same church I am in, but I am not in the same church you are in. The first brother was only in the church, that is, only in one layer of association.
[138]  Therefore, we need to be delivered thoroughly and come back to the pure ground of the church, not belonging to this sect or that denomination but belonging only to the church and being people who are only in the church.
[139]  We have repeatedly said that the church is one.
[140]  Therefore, everything concerning the church is one, not two, whether it is her source, fellowship, or ground.
[141]  In many portions in the Bible, when the church is spoken of, it is singular in number, referring to the single, unique church, the one church.
[142]  If there were many churches in a city, in a locality, instead of speaking of the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, and the church in Corinth, the Bible would have referred to the churches in Jerusalem, the churches in Antioch, and the churches in Corinth.
[143]  God wants the church in each locality to be a miniature, a small-scale representation, of His universal church so that all the local churches are the same as the universal church in nature and principle, just as small chicks are similar to the large hen.
[144]  If we add up all the local churches of the past and the present, local and abroad, this would equal the universal church.
[145]  If we subtract all the local churches one after the other, there would be no universal church.
[146]  Actually, it is the local church, except that it is not only one local church; it is all the local churches.
[147]  God s desire is that every local church would represent the Body of Christ to testify on behalf of Christ in their respective localities.
[148]  Just as the universal church has these two aspects, the local church also has these two aspects: it is the Body to Christ and the dwelling place of God Rom 12:4-5; 1 Tim 3:15 .
[149]  The local church is the universal church in practicality because the local church is the reality of the universal church.
[150]  The Lord wants to build the church in the universe upon Himself as the rock, but His building is done through the local church.
[151]  After the Lord said that He would build the universal church in Matthew 16, He said that if a problem between believers could not be resolved, then they should tell it to the church 18:17 .
[152]  It is not enough that we are freed from the division of the sects; we still need to stand on the ground of the local church, representing the universal church and manifesting the proper living of the Body of Christ.
[153]  Now let us look briefly at the relationship between one local church and another local church.
[154]  The administration of every local church is local; it is independent in each locality.
[155]  Everyone who truly desires to know the church must look at it not only from the standpoint of the Word of God and the light of God but also from the history of the church and the actual condition of the church.
[156]  Only when we have looked at all these aspects can we have a complete and thorough view of the church.
[157]  Therefore, we need to spend some time to look at the degradation and the recovery of the church, that is, to look at the history and the present condition of the church.
[158]  Only after we understand the original condition of the church can we know how the church has degraded and deviated, and only then can we know the matters that have been recovered and corrected and even what matters still need to be recovered and corrected.
[159]  But brothers and sisters, if we know the word of God, we can clearly see that the goal of God is to obtain the church.
[160]  In the age of the church everything God does is for the church.
[161]  God s desire is to gain a church in each locality in this age so that He may express Himself through the church.
[162]  We also saw how the church is an entity of oneness, how the ground of the church is related to oneness, and how everything sectarian results in the loss of the ground of the church.
[163]  Concerning the original condition of the church, we cannot possibly cover everything; rather, we can look only at some important points related to the testimony and the ground of the church so that through them we can know the church, including her principle, her constitution, and her ground.
[164]  According to these aspects, we need to look at seven points briefly.
[165]  One of the characteristics of the original church was that there was no hierarchy among the saved ones.
[166]  I dearly hope that among us there are those who really are elders, who love the church of God, shepherd the flock of God, and who lead the brothers and sisters.
[167]  But in the New Testament, in the church, there is no longer such an intermediary class; rather, all the believers are priests to God, without any distinctions between the so-called clergy and laity.
[168]  The original church also had another notable feature; there was only one expression in each locality.
[169]  This principle of one locality, one church prohibits God s children from being divided.
[170]  If the church does not take one locality, one church as its principle or take the locality as its jurisdiction and ground, there surely will be division and confusion.
[171]  After a group of Christians comes to Taipei, they set up their kind of church ; when another group comes, they set up their kind of church ; and when yet another group comes, they also set up their kind of church.
[172]  The higher church would rule over the lower church, and the lower church would obey the higher church, disregarding the headship of Christ and the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[173]  Now we need to briefly look at the degradation of the church, which is also the history of the church, by checking its history against the seven points spoken of in the previous chapter.
[174]  At that time there was an elder in the church in Rome whose name was Clement.
[175]  In the degradation of the church the third item is the bringing in of idols.
[176]  In its degradation, the church was filled with all kinds of idols; this can be seen in the Roman Catholic Church.
[177]  When the church began to have an unlawful organization for unification, Christ lost His position in the church and the Holy Spirit could no longer rule in the church.
[178]  CHAPTER THREE THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH I. THE RECOVERY WITH THE PROTESTANT CHURCH
[179]  Now we need to see the recovery of the church.
[180]  We must realize that the original condition of the church on earth did not last long.
[181]  The church was established around A.D. 30, but near the end of the first century, after only fifty or sixty years, when the apostle John was about to depart from this world, the church began to have a little degradation.
[182]  At that time the desolation of the church was limited to its inward content; it remained more or less the same in its principle and ground.
[183]  It could be said that the church at that time could no longer be considered the church.
[184]  Second, the Protestant church was not separated from the world.
[185]  The beginning of the Protestant church was the formation of various state churches; thus, the church fell into the hands of political governments.
[186]  Therefore, the Protestant church was not freed from the world; it was still, in principle, the same as the Roman Catholic Church which was mixed with the Roman Empire.
[187]  Although the Reformation was a great recovery of the church, only a small part was recovered; a great number of important matters of the church were still not recovered.
[188]  Although the recovery with the Moravian brethren was quite strong, God did not stop there; instead, He continued to take the way of recovery.
[189]  In the beginning the Brethren absolutely eliminated sectarianism and maintained the testimony of oneness.
[190]  They came together to maintain the testimony of the oneness of the church.
[191]  What we have seen above is in regard to the Lord s recovery in the Western world.
[192]  Now we need to speak a little concerning the Lord s recovery in the East.
[193]  When we rose up to take the way of the Lord s recovery by absolutely obeying the word of God, we read from the Word that the situation of division into sects and denominations is not right; it is not according to the Bible.
[194]  In 1932, when we began to meet as the church in Chefoo, Shantung Province, there were eleven brothers present for the first three Lord s table meetings.
[195]  We all felt grateful to the Lord that even though we were previously divided by the denominations, we were now breaking the Lord s bread together to testify of the oneness of the church.
[196]  From the Word of God we clearly saw that the church in each locality has its own administration and is independent of the other churches.
[197]  Each local church has its own eldership and its own administration.
[198]  The administration of the church cannot go beyond the locality; once it goes beyond the local boundary, it causes the church to lose its local nature.
[199]  The fellowship of the church should not only be local; rather, it should also be universal because it is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.
[200]  Finally, we need to consider our practice and attitude today.
[201]  This will enable us to understand our ground, be clear concerning our practice, and know our way.
[202]  Even now, without saying anything regarding the outsiders who are not clear concerning us, many newly saved brothers and sisters among us are not clear.
[203]  First, we emphasize the testimony of the church in reality as the fullness of Christ, which is filled with Christ, full of the presence of Christ, and thereby expresses Christ.
[204]  Likewise, Christ as the testimony of God is the center of God, but He also needs the outward ground of the church to match and support Him.
[205]  I repeat, we are 1 meeting in the local churches, 2 standing on the ground of the local church, 3 serving in coordination, 4 according to the principle of the local church, 5 by the nature of the local church, 6 to live out the proper life of the Body of Christ, 7 for the expression of the life of Christ, and 8 as the testimony of the church.
