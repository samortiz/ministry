   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible contains many biographies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Old Testament shows us the portraits of Abraham, Moses, David, and many others, and the New Testament presents to us the lives of Peter, John, Paul, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These biographies convey much of the divine revelation concerning God and His dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As I had a close and spiritual contact with Brother Watchman Nee for twenty-five years, and as I was involved in the same unique work with him for the Lord's recovery for such a long time, I felt burdened to write a biography for him that the life and work of such a witness of the Lord might not disappear from those after him, but rather might be kept, as it should be, to minister Christ according to God's desire to the generations to come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But to write a biography of a certain person is not an easy and simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Could what is written about that person be a genuine picture of him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is the motive for writing proper?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is the writing accurate?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What will the influence be?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What will the issue be?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After much consideration, my solution to all these points is this: Since I have been under Brother Nee's teaching, edifying, and perfecting, and since he was a brother I respected, observed, and weighed for a quarter of a century, the accuracy of my writing about him should be guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As to the motive, the heart-searching God is the Judge!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to the influence and issue, the merciful Lord is the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Much endeavor has been exercised to avoid flattery, exaggerations, and the exaltation of men, and the Holy Spirit has been the Guide and Controller of this writing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, I desire to see this writing accomplished unto the good pleasure of the Triune God for His rich blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This volume, except chapter thirty, was consummated for publishing in 1977.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But at that time, though many were expecting to see a book concerning Brother Nee's life, within my spirit I did not feel pleasant to release it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So I concealed it for fourteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This corresponds with the apostle Paul's experience in 2 Corinthians 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After such a long period of concealment, I now have the sensation as many others do that I should no longer conceal it, but publish it according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May such a slave and witness of Christ as Brother Nee, still speak and shine through the lines of this inadequate writing, under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ, and for the glory of the One whom he loved and lived for his whole life.</S>
