   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A VISION OF AN ANGEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 10:3 and 4 say, He saw clearly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him, Cornelius!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And looking intently at him and becoming terrified, he said, What is it, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have ascended for a memorial before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Cornelius was one of fallen mankind, sinful and condemned before God as all others, yet God accepted his prayers and his alms, whereas Cain s He rejected Gen 4:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This must have been due to the fact that God, based upon Christ s eternal redemption and in view of his believing in Christ in the ensuing days, forgave him v. 43 according to His foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 10:3, an angel of God appeared to Cornelius and spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An angel was also used by God in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In that case an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza 8:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The angels in these two cases indicate that these cases are extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The preaching of the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch was the bringing of the gospel to a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, the preaching of the gospel to the house of Cornelius was the preaching of the gospel to a Gentile family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since this was an extraordinary case, an angel was involved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, neither in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch nor in the case of Cornelius and his household was the angel commissioned to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason for this is that only human beings who are believers in the Lord Jesus have the privilege of bringing the good news to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the vision of Cornelius 10:1-8 , we have the vision of Peter 10:9-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 10:9 says, And on the next day as they were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Cornelius received a vision in prayer v. 30 , and Peter also received a vision vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>17, 19 in prayer, through which God s plan and move were carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man s prayer is needed as a means of cooperation with God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter ten of Acts there is a strong emphasis on the importance of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First we have Cornelius prayer and then Peter s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The prayers of these two men became the means for the Lord to come in to open the door for the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While Cornelius, a devout man, was praying, a vision came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, it was while Peter was praying that the vision recorded in this chapter came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this we see that we all need to learn to have a prayer life, for a prayer life always prepares the way for the Lord s move and opens the gate for Him to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As those who are here for the Lord s recovery, we must learn that the Lord can use only those who have a prayer life, a life of contacting Him in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not told for what Cornelius and Peter were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The record does indicate, however, that they set aside certain times for prayer, that they prayed according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Acts 10:3 says that Cornelius was praying at the ninth hour, at three o clock in the afternoon, and 10:9 says that Peter was praying at the sixth hour, at twelve o clock noon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From this we see that they had a prayer life and even prayed at scheduled times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we in the Lord s recovery have such a prayer life according to set times, we shall be used by Him in opening the way for the spread of His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PETER S VISION OF A GREAT SHEET</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to 10:10 Peter became very hungry and desired to eat; and while they were preparing, a trance came upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter s hunger here signifies the seeking after the things of God Matt 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God fills this hunger Luke 1:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word rendered eat is usually rendered taste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In an Ecstasy</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Greek word translated trance is ekstasis, which means being put out of its place; hence, referring to a state in which a man passes out of himself and from which he comes to himself 12:11 , as in a dream, but without sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It differs from a vision, as in verses 3, 17, and 19, in which definite objects are visible to human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this ecstasy trance Peter saw a vision 11:5 .</S>
