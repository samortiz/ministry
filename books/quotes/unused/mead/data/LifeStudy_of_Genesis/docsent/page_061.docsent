   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Sabbath Was Made for Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Pharisees forced every man to be for the sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord condemned them, telling them that they were absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said that the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath Mark 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's destiny is not work it is the sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3 Man Rests Because God Rests</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever God is satisfied, you are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever you are satisfied, that is a proof that God is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>4 Man Rests When God's Work on Man</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Reaches His Goal</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Don't work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just take care of one thing: to let God reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is God's goal?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's goal is to have His image expressed and to have His dominion exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as you have God's image expressed and God's dominion exercised to deal with His enemy, God has reached His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God will say, "I am satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then you will say, "God, I am satisfied too."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, you rest with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the aforementioned rests are due to the fact that God has reached His goal and man enjoys the rest with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am so happy that the Lord has afforded us the opportunity to release these nine messages on Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From these messages we can see that everything written in the divine record is fully focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 1 and 2 are simply an outline.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The biographies of the eight men Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph will present the full picture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually we will see that Jacob and Joseph are coupled together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two are actually one man: Jacob becomes Israel, the prince of God, bearing the image of God; Joseph becomes the one to rule over everything, exercising God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the end of Genesis, we will see a dual man: one aspect Jacob expressing God's image and the other aspect Joseph exercising God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's image is expressed, God's authority is exercised, and there is rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The whole Bible, with all its stories, histories, biographies, and teachings, is focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This life will produce the expression of God and the representation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God will be manifested and His enemy will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then there will be ultimate rest in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We thank God for the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the New Testament, it would be difficult for us to understand the allegories, types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, without the Old Testament, we would have only the direct words of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We would lack the pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that we have both testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have the pictures and we have the clear words that we may know where we are in God's image and God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall be in God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to remember the five crucial words that we have covered thus far image, dominion, blessing, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we bear the image of God expressing Him, we will have the dominion of God representing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then His full blessing will be upon us and we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, God and we will all rest in full satisfaction under His blessing with His image and dominion.</S>
