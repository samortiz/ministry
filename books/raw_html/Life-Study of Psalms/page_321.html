<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT<br>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>GOD'S FORGIVENESS TO ISRAEL AND HIS REDEEMING<br>OF ISRAEL FROM ALL THEIR INIQUITY</H2><P>In Psalm 130 we see the way God deals with His chosen people. This psalm is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning God's forgiveness to Israel and His redeeming of Israel from all their iniquity. We are not better than the persecutors and the haters. We need God's forgiveness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. No One Standing if Jehovah Marked Iniquities</H2><P>The psalmist cried out to Jehovah, praying that His ears would be attentive to the voice of his supplications (vv. 1-2). Then the psalmist said, "If You, O Jehovah, marked iniquities, / Who, O Lord, would stand?" (v. 3).</P><P>Nearly every morning I begin my prayer by saying, "Lord, thank You that You have forgiven me of all my transgressions, failures, and defeats. Lord, I also thank You that You have cleansed me of all my filthiness with Your cleansing blood." I have no other way to start my prayer, for I realize that every day my imperfections need God's forgiveness and my filthiness needs His cleansing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. There Being Forgiveness with Jehovah,<br>That He Would Be Feared</H2><P>"With You there is forgiveness,/That You would be feared" (v. 4). The more the Lord forgives us, the more we fear Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Waiting for the Lord<br>and Hoping in Him and in His Word</H2><P>In verses 5 through 8 the psalmist speaks of waiting for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning and hoping in Him and in His word for His abundant redemption that will redeem Israel from all their iniquity.</P>
