   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ELECTRUM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's intention is not just to burn us and turn us into ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our God has a good purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Out of the fire comes the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word electrum is very difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No other language has an equivalent to this Hebrew word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>J. N. Darby says in his note on Ezekiel 1:4 that some would suggest that electrum is a kind of shining metal, a mixture of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One Jewish version also uses this word electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Electrum is a metal that is a mixture of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The King James Version renders it as amber because the color of this shining metal is the color of amber.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Amber is a color somewhat like the color of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord for His revelation of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not merely gold nor merely silver, but gold mixed with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the book of Revelation we can see the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the throne is not just the Lamb and not just God, but the Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Lamb-God, the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 1, He was solely God having nothing of the element of redemption within Him; but in Revelation He is the redeeming God, the Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Revelation 4:3, God is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His appearance is like two kinds of precious stones jasper and sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sardius is red and jasper is a green crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The red color of sardius signifies redemption and the crystal green of jasper signifies God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This picture shows us that God looks like both jasper and sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is no more just God, having only the divine nature; He is also our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These two illustrations from the book of Revelation help us to understand the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our God is not merely a divine Being represented by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is now the electrum gold mingled with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By putting all these items together, we have such a clear picture of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First we experience the blowing wind; next we enjoy the covering cloud; then we experience the burning and consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The result is that the electrum is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Something is so shining, so precious!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the electrum, He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus is our God and He is our Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus is our jasper and He is our sardius.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must experience God as the spiritual wind, as the overshadowing cloud, as the burning fire, as the Lamb, and as the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By passing through this kind of experience, we become the vision of the glory of such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When people look upon us they can see the wind; they can see the cloud; they can see the fire; and they can see the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we meet together, we must be the vision of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be the vision of the glory of the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do have something shining, something glowing, something so precious, so dear, like a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We just cannot tell whether He is merely God, or whether He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is everything to us He is the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE BASIC EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the first vision seen by Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Among all our experiences in life, this is the most basic.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we go on through this chapter we will see other categories of our experiences, but this is the first and most basic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must ask the Lord for the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not experience these things once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather this cycle must be repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First comes the wind, then the cloud, then the fire, and then the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A few days later, the wind comes again with the cloud, with the fire, and with more electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a sense, we Christians have no rest in our spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have been a Christian for over 45 years and I have never had any rest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Always there has been the blowing, the covering, the burning, and then the receiving of something as the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose this cycle would be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That would be awful!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In our experience this cycle should never be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more often we can experience this cycle, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every day we should have a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every day we should experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the real experience of the inner life and this will bring in the growth in life.</S>
