GOD'S CARE AND DELIVERANCE<br>OF HIS REDEEMED IN CHRIST</H2><P>Psalm 107 is on God's care and deliverance of His redeemed in Christ. No doubt, God takes care of us every day, always delivering us, rescuing us, and saving us. When some hear this, they may say that this is comfort. Yes, it is comfort, but it is the divine comfort in Christ. When we speak of the comfort in this psalm, we have to say that this is the comfort in Christ. Then we will say, "Hallelujah!" However, if we speak of divine comfort without seeing that this comfort is in Christ, we will not say, "Hallelujah." Christ is the One who induces us to speak hallelujahs and to praise the Lord not for comfort, care, or deliverance but for Christ, in whom we are.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Thanks of God's Redeemed,<br>Gathered from the East, West, North, and South</H2><P>"Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good,/For His lovingkindness is forever./Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,/Whom He redeemed from the hand of the adversary,/And gathered out of the lands,/From the east and from the west, /From the north and from the south" (vv. 1-3). The word "redeemed" in verse 2 implies Christ, for He is our Redeemer and even our redemption. This gives us the ground to say that the comfort in this psalm is in Christ. In Christ we enjoy God's care and deliverance, which imply His rescue and saving every day.</P><P>Furthermore, the gathering out of the lands, from the east, west, north, and south, mentioned in verse 2 corresponds to Revelation 5:9, which speaks of those purchased for God by Christ's blood "out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation." In this matter we once again use the New Testament to interpret the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Care and Deliverance<br>of the Wanderers</H2><P>Psalm 107:4-9 speaks of God's care and deliverance of the wanderers. Such ones "wandered in the wilderness, on the desert way;/They found no city of habitation./Hungry and thirsty,/Their soul fainted within them" (vv. 4-5). This was our situation before we were saved. We were homeless and famished; we were without a habitation and without food. Then God took care of us and delivered us, providing us food and a lodging place. Hallelujah, in the church we are at home, and we are fed every day! Our testimony is that "He satisfies the thirsty soul,/And the famished soul He fills with good" (v. 9).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_281.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_283.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 282</div><br></body></html>
