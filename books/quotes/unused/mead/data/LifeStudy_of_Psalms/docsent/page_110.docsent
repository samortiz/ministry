   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Standing on His Not Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Company with the Wicked</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David stood on his not being in company with the wicked vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4-5, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Psalm 26 David spoke of his adversaries within and his enemies without.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He felt that he was holy, separated, and that they were wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the eyes of God, however, he and his adversaries and enemies were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is better about us than others?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All men are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be delivered from our human concept and be filled with the divine concept of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the divine concept, we have been crucified and buried with Christ Gal 2:20a; Rom 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now it should not be we who live but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is according to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Washing His Hands in Innocence</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>to Go around God's Altar, Giving Thanks to God and Telling Out His Wonderful Deeds</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>David said that he washed his hands in innocence to go around God's altar Psa 26:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As he went around the altar, he made himself heard with the voice of thanksgiving and the telling out of God's wonderful deeds v. 7 . David felt that he was innocent and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I respect David very much, and I believe that he was a great man in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was very spiritual in a sense, but not in all senses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can see that many times he was not that much up to the standard of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The standard of the law is not the standard of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The standard of God's economy is the standard of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's economy is not for making us a good man but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how good a person is, as long as he is not a God-man, he is not up to the standard of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regretfully, however, nearly all the Christian readers of the Psalms keep the standard of being a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have not seen the standard of being a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God wants us to be a God-man, not merely a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should have only one o as in God, not two o's as in good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>D. Walking in His Integrity and Asking God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>to Redeem Him and Be Gracious to Him</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David indicated that God should redeem him and be gracious to him because of his integrity v. 11 . This is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are walking in integrity, being absolutely pure and absolutely perfect, we do not need redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God would surely not redeem us because of our integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, a man should pray, "O God, redeem me because I am a great sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul said that Christ came into the world to save sinners and that he was the foremost sinner among all the sinners 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The proper prayer is: "Lord Jesus, I need Your redemption because I am a sinful person."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the right attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Surely this is according to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 12 David said, "My foot stands on level ground;/In the assemblies I will bless Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say that we walk in our integrity and that our foot stands on level ground is being too boastful and proud.</S>
