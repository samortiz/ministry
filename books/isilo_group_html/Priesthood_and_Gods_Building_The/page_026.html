<p>Let us now consider the line of authority in the Bible. As soon as the Israelites became a kingdom, authority was established among them, because there must be authority in a kingdom. Among the children of Israel, Moses was the first person to represent God&rsquo;s authority. After Moses there was Joshua, and after Joshua, God&rsquo;s authority was with the judges. When David was raised up, the authority of the kingship was brought in. The authority of the kingship was the authority of the kingdom. After David and Solomon, the kings became corrupted and defiled the authority that they had received from God. When the priests were improper and the kings were defiled, the prophets were raised up.</p>
<p>God desired to have proper priests and kings. But when the priests and kings were not up to the standard, the prophets came in as a help and a supplement. The Old Testament prophets include Elijah and Elisha. They ministered when the children of Israel were in a desolate state. At the time of King Ahab, who was very evil and corrupt, the priests seemed to have disappeared.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the apostles, such as Peter, John, and Paul, were not only in the priesthood but also had the authority of God. With time, however, the church became desolate, the priesthood waned, and the authority in the church failed. Although there are pastors and preachers in Christianity, the functions of the priesthood and the kingship are missing. Furthermore, the majority of God&rsquo;s children do not know how to function as a priest or a king. They know only about giving a message or listening to a message. Believers rush to hear a famous preacher, and they attend revival meetings, but their condition remains desolate.</p>
<p>Such a condition exists even among us. Many local churches are seeking eloquent ministers of the word, but they do not pay much attention to every saint functioning as a royal priest. This does not mean that it is wrong to speak for God or that ministers of the word are not needed. The Word needs to be increased and strengthened among us, but the priesthood and the kingship need to be stronger than the prophethood. When the people of God are normal, they should be priests and kings. They should fellowship with God, abide in Him, and allow Him to flow through them, thus bringing in the authority of the kingship. As a result, they will be able to exercise authority in fellowship, or have fellowship with authority.</p>
<p>Everyone in the church should be a royal priest. First Corinthians 14:1 says that the believers should desire to prophesy. This shows that the gift of prophesying is obtained through desiring and pursuing. In contrast, a believer becomes a royal priest as soon as he is saved (1 Pet. 2:9). Every believer has this status. We do not like it when only a few saints pray, nor do we like to see the ministry of the word being stronger than the ministry of the priesthood. We hope that more saints will pray and sing in the meetings. There are times when we need to hear a special word, but the normal situation should be that the meetings are full of the service of the royal priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MINISTERING AS PRIESTS</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 4:16, the way to minister as a priest is simply to come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. Revelation 22:1 says that the river of water of life proceeds from the throne of God. If we compare these two verses, we will realize that mercy and grace proceed out of God to be man&rsquo;s life. When we come forward to behold God and contact Him by praying in our spirit and touching His throne, we experience the Spirit flowing in us. The operation of the Spirit in us is not only like the anointing but also like the flowing of the water of life. When we draw near to God in prayer to fellowship with Him, we have an inner sense that the Spirit is flowing through us and supplying us. This supply is the timely help, which is the mercy and grace of God. Although we are unworthy, the mercy of God reaches us and positions us to receive His grace as our timely help.</p>
<p>If we give things to someone who is lovable, it is called grace; if we give things to a beggar, it is called mercy. If a person&rsquo;s condition is normal, he receives grace; if his condition is poor, he receives mercy. In the eyes of God our condition is poor. Nevertheless, God still visits us. This visitation is mercy. After He bestows mercy on us, He gives us grace.</p>
<p>Both mercy and grace refer to God flowing through us and being gained by us. Sometimes a saint testifies, &ldquo;My landlord was hard on me. Then I prayed, and God opened the way for me as my timely help.&rdquo; Some sisters testify, &ldquo;I was in difficulty because my child was sick. Then I prayed, and God answered my prayer by healing my child. This was truly the timely help.&rdquo; Such testimonies are not wrong, but the descriptions might not be accurate. The answers for these types of prayers are not the &ldquo;timely help&rdquo; that we are referring to. Have we not had experiences of prayers that resulted in the opposite of what we prayed for? There have been times when we were in a difficult situation, but the more we prayed, the more trouble there was. Sometimes we have prayed when a family member was sick, but the sickness did not leave. There are many times when our prayers are not &ldquo;answered&rdquo; by God in our way of &ldquo;timely help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not our prayer is &ldquo;answered,&rdquo; as long as we contact God, He will flow through us as the living water. This flow is our timely help. The problems might remain or even become worse, but inwardly we will experience unspeakable peace and joy. This is timely help. Timely help is the living God, the flowing God, coming into us and flowing through us to refresh, water, and supply us.</p>
<p>Our God is a flowing God. The first step that He took was to flow out in His Son. The second step was to flow out in the Holy Spirit. According to the Gospel of John, the first step of His flowing out was to be the bread of life, and the second step of His flowing out was to be the water of life (6:35; 7:38-39). The Lord Jesus is the bread of life, and the Spirit is the water of life. Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb proceeds the river of water of life, and the tree of life grows along both sides of the river. We must see that this is God flowing out. The tree of life is Christ, and the water of life is the Holy Spirit, both of whom flow out to be our supply.</p>
<p>The way into the Holy of Holies is now open, and we can enter in (Heb. 10:19-20). We can touch the throne. God and the Lamb are flowing out from the throne to be our supply. Whenever, by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we come forward and touch the throne of grace, God flows to refresh and water us, and we experience indescribable joy, no matter how harsh the circumstances are.</p>
<p>God has only one throne in the universe. He does not have two thrones. Just as the light is in the lamp, God is in the Lamb. God in Christ is sitting on one throne. To the believers, this throne is the throne of grace, but to God&rsquo;s enemy, it is the throne of authority. The throne of grace is related to the priesthood, and the throne of authority is related to the kingship.</p>
<p>Out from the throne of God flows the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1) and the river of fire (Dan. 7:10). The river of water of life is for grace, and the river of fire is for judgment. Those persons who allow the river of water of life to flow through them will end up in the New Jerusalem, but those who are swept away by the river of fire will end up in the lake of fire. The meaning of the universe is related to these two rivers. The flow of the river of water of life produces a city of water, but the river of the fire of God&rsquo;s judgment flows into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>As believers, we have a twofold status: we are both priests and kings. The priesthood is related to the throne of grace, and the kingship is related to the throne of authority. When we touch the throne of grace and allow the water to flow through us, we receive mercy and grace for timely help. Then we can touch His throne of authority so that He can judge the improper situations within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING AS PRIESTS<br />
TO BRING IN THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>Our function as a priest is to touch the throne of grace. Hebrews says that we can pass through the veil that was split to enter the Holy of Holies in order to contact God by touching the throne of grace (10:19-20; 4:16). When we touch the throne, the water of life will flow into us and become our timely help. Moreover, when we draw near to God in such a way, we will be carried by the flow into fellowship with God and into the building of God. The more we allow the water of life to flow in us, the more we will sense that we cannot be independent, and the more the Spirit will blend us with other saints into one. As a result, we will be built up together.</p>
<p>In order for God to gain His building, we must be those who allow Him to flow through us by entering into the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of God. God desires such priests. God desired that the man created by Him would be such a person. After man fell, God desired that the people called by Him would be such persons. After they became desolate, God desired that the people sanctified by Him would be such persons. God still desires that His redeemed people would be such persons. Therefore, He is sounding out the call for His people to see this vision, answer His call, and stand on His side.</p>
<p>God wants us, His saved ones, to enter into the Holy of Holies in order to touch the throne of grace and allow the water of life to flow through us. Then our inner condition will match the New Jerusalem. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be established in us, and the river of water of life will flow in us. This flow will bring us into fellowship with God and will cause us to be built up in His life to be His holy dwelling place. This is what God desires today.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
