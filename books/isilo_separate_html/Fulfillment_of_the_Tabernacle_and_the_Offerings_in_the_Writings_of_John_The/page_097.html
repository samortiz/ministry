The word &#8220;anointed&#8221; here proves this, because the Lord&#8217;s Spirit is the anointing Spirit (Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27). Hence, this compound, this anointing, is formed by mingling the Spirit with the man created by God.<p>In this chapter we have the mingling of spittle with earth to make clay. Another kind of mingling is found in Leviticus 2, where we have the mingling of oil with fine flour to make the meal offering. Both the clay in John 9 and the meal offering in Leviticus 2 are a compound. The meal offering is a compound formed by mingling two elements-oil and flour. The clay is also a compound formed by mingling two elements-spittle and earth. As we have indicated, the clay signifies us, human beings created by God, and the spittle signifies the Lord&#8217;s word, which is spirit and life. Therefore, the clay here signifies the mingling of the Spirit with our being.<p>Now we can see how the light of the world, Jesus Christ, can come into a person who was born blind. The light of the world comes into a blind man through the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with our being. In order to come into us, Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Now as the Spirit He is able to come into us and mingle with us. This is the significance of the clay, the spittle, and the anointing in this chapter.<p>The blind man in John 9 was cast out of the synagogue (vv. 34, 22). Verse 35 says, &#8220;Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, He said, Do you believe in the Son of God?&#8221; Notice that the Lord Jesus did not ask him if he believed the Son of God; He asked him if he believed in the Son of God. The Greek preposition translated &#8220;in&#8221; here actually means &#8220;into.&#8221; Believing into the Son of God implies an organic union between the believer and the Son of God in whom he believes. When we believe in the Son of God, we believe into Him. This means that our believing brings about an organic union between us and the Son of God, and in this union we are one with Him. It is in this way that the light of the world comes into a blind person. It is in this way that a person born blind becomes one with Him who is the light of the world. The result is that blindness vanishes.<p>The Gospel of John is a profound book. Because this Gospel is profound, we should not understand it in a shallow way. Rather, we need to touch the depths of the revelation in this book. For example, in chapter two we have the sign of changing water into wine. It is important to know the significance of this sign. Water here signifies death, and the six waterpots full of water (six is the number of man) signify man full of death. Wine signifies a pleasant life. Hence, the changing of water into wine signifies the changing of death into a pleasant life. To have this understanding is to touch the depths of the truth related to this sign.<p>In the same principle, we need to understand the signs in chapter nine of the Gospel of John in a deep way. In this chapter the spittle signifies the words, which are spirit and life, issuing out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth, and the clay signifies humanity. Making clay with spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the word spoken by the Lord, a word spoken from within the Lord Himself, and which is spirit and life. When we receive the Lord Jesus as the Spirit and life and believe in Him, we enter into an organic union with Him. In this union He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him. This is the way Christ as the light of the world comes into a blind person. When this light comes into a person born blind, his blindness vanishes, and he receives his sight.<p>Many of us can testify that when we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we received our sight and began to see a marvelous, divine view. Before we received the Lord, we were altogether ignorant of spiritual things. But after we believed in the Lord Jesus and entered into an organic union with Him, spiritual things began to be clear to us. We also had a clear view of human life, of where we came from and where we are going, and of the meaning of human life. The reason we could see these things is that the light of the world had been mingled with our being. As a result of the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with our being, our blindness disappeared.<p>Consider the case of Saul of Tarsus. Before he was called by the Lord Jesus, he did not know he was blind. Saul had been educated in Tarsus, a city known for its culture. Not only did he have a good secular education, but he had been trained in the things of Judaism. But although Saul was a highly educated person, he was blind. However, he did not know that he was blind. He knew so many things, but he did not know the Lord Jesus. Then one day the Lord appeared to him and called to him, saying, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&#8221; (Acts 9:4). Saul answered, &#8220;Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest&#8221; (v. 5). Saul may have wondered how he could have been persecuting Jesus. According to his understanding, he persecuted Stephen and other disciples of the Lord Jesus. But as far as he was concerned, Jesus was in the tomb. How blind he was!<p>After Saul met the Lord Jesus, he became physically blind for a period of time. &#8220;And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight&#8221; (Acts 9:8-9a). Saul had led others to persecute Jesus; now it was necessary for others to lead him.<p>When the Lord Jesus called Saul on the way to Damascus, the Lord said to him, &#8220;I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God&#8221; (Acts 26:16-18a). Perhaps Saul wondered why, if the Lord was sending him to open the eyes of others, his own eyes had been closed. If Saul had asked the Lord concerning this, the Lord may have told him that his eyes had been too open, and now they needed to be closed so that he could see spiritual things.<p>During the days he was physically blind, Saul may have seen many divine and spiritual things, not, of course, with his physical eyes, but with his inner, spiritual eyes. Formerly, his physical eyes were open, but his inner eyes were blind. But after he met the Lord Jesus, his inner eyes were opened, and, for a period of time, his physical eyes were blinded. Because Saul&#8217;s spiritual eyes were now open and he could see spiritual things, the Lord told him that he was sending him to open the eyes of the Gentiles, all of whom were born blind.<p>All of today&#8217;s unbelievers are blind. Is there anyone who is not blind from birth? No, without exception, we all were born blind. We may have the highest education and the most developed culture; nevertheless, we have been born blind. This is still the situation of all unbelievers. Therefore, the unbelievers need the mingling of the life-giving Spirit with their being. If they experience this mingling, the divine light will come into them, their blindness will vanish, and their darkness will disappear.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_096.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_098.html">Next</a> </body></html>
