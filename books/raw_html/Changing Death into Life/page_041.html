        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING<br />
THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE</h2>
<p>Where can the dead go to receive resurrection and the life that they need? Who can give the dead resurrection and life? Who has resurrection and life? Who is resurrection and life? The Lord Jesus answered these questions in John 11.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came to the place where the sisters of Lazarus were, everything was under the shadow of death. The people were despondent and full of despair. Lazarus had died! If he had only been sick, there would have been hope. But he had died. There was no hope. Under such a shadow of death and despair, the Lord said to Martha, the older sister of Lazarus, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life&rdquo; (v. 25). Here the Lord clearly revealed that the dead need Him as the resurrection and the life. Because people in the world are dead, they need resurrection and life, which are the Lord Himself. He is the resurrection and the life. Hence, He can give resurrection and life to solve the problem of death. Not only does He give resurrection and life; He even enters into man to be resurrection and life. The resurrection and the life that He gives man are Himself. He is the resurrection that man needs, and He is the life that man needs. Only the Lord Jesus can meet the need of the dead. He wants to enter into the dead to be their resurrection life. When He enters into them as their resurrection life, He manifests the power of resurrection and the power of life in them so that they may pass out of death into life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPINIONS RESISTING THE LORD&rsquo;S RESURRECTION LIFE</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and to raise man out of death, but He often runs into obstacles within man. The main obstacle is human opinions. John 11 also describes this obstacle that the resurrection life of the Lord Jesus encountered. The greatest hindrance that the Lord encountered was the opinions of Martha, the sister of Lazarus. Martha&rsquo;s younger sister, Mary, also had opinions, although not as many as Martha had. The Lord could not do certain things because of these opinions. Opinions resist and hinder the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life. In this chapter there is a dead man, and there is the Savior, who is resurrection. The dead man needs to be saved by the Savior, and the Savior even needs a dead man in order to express the glory and the power of His resurrection. The Savior needs Lazarus, and Lazarus needs the Savior, but there are opinions that frustrate these needs.</p>
<p>In the Bible women always represent mankind. Therefore, in this chapter Martha represents mankind. The Lord Jesus is resurrection, and Lazarus signifies death. Death needs resurrection, but resurrection also needs death. Without death the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection cannot be manifested fully. The dead sinner needed the Lord of resurrection, and the Lord of resurrection needed the dead sinner. However, Martha&rsquo;s opinions frequently came in to frustrate the Savior. Her first opinion was to notify the Lord Jesus that Lazarus was sick so that the Lord would come quickly. As the resurrection, however, the Lord did not need to come quickly. Martha&rsquo;s request was an opinion. When the Lord Jesus learned that Lazarus was sick, He purposely did not come for two more days. By delaying two days, He went against Martha&rsquo;s opinion. Martha wanted Him to come quickly, but He did not; it seemed as if He did not care about Lazarus. Because of this delay, Lazarus died of the sickness, and Martha was greatly disappointed because the Lord did not answer her petition. The Lord seemed to ignore her; He did not send a reply and seemingly left her in her suffering. It is not that the Lord did not have the power to heal her brother. Martha had followed the Lord for years. The Lord loved and cared for this family. She had seen the Lord heal many sick people, and she could not understand why the Lord would let her brother die instead of coming to heal him. With such frustration and disappointment, Martha buried her brother.</p>
<p>There are many other opinions in John 11. There are Martha&rsquo;s opinions, and there are also the disciples&rsquo; opinions. When the Lord Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, He remained for two days. When He was ready to go to Lazarus, the disciples exhorted Him not to go, because they feared that the Jews would stone Him to death. But because the Lord Jesus was going, they had no choice but to say, &ldquo;Let us also go, that we may die with Him&rdquo; (v. 16). These are also opinions.</p>
<p>There is hardly any person in this chapter who was without an opinion. There is only one person who did not have an opinion&mdash;Lazarus, who was dead. Every living person has opinions. Martha and the disciples had opinions; Mary and the other Jews also had opinions. These opinions were against the Lord&rsquo;s intention. As soon as Martha saw the Lord Jesus, she voiced an opinion. The first word out of her mouth was a complaint: &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (v. 21). She was saying, &ldquo;You are too late. Why did You not come sooner? If You had come sooner, my brother would not have died.&rdquo; This was her opinion. When the Lord said that her brother would rise again, she gave another opinion, saying, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day&rdquo; (v. 24). Then the Lord had no choice but to say, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life&rdquo; (v. 25). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Resurrection is not a matter of time or of the last day but a matter of Me. As long as I am here, there is no problem. I am the resurrection. Being early is not resurrection, and being late is not death. Rather, I am the resurrection. Whether I am early or late, I am the resurrection. There is no need to wait until the last day to have resurrection. I am the resurrection now.&rdquo; After the Lord said this, He asked Martha, &ldquo;Do you believe this?&rdquo; (v. 26), and Martha answered, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 27). This was an irrelevant answer to His question. It was an opinion. It is difficult for those who have opinions to hear or to understand others.</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s opinions hindered and frustrated the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life. If Martha had not had any opinions, the Lord Jesus would have been able to manifest His power of resurrection in a simple way. However, there were many troubles that day. These troubles originated from Martha. She was a frustration to the Lord of resurrection.</p>
<p>The obstacle to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection power is opinions. After Martha finished speaking, she went to look for her sister, Mary; she had not listened to what the Lord Jesus said. Instead, she told Mary, &ldquo;The Teacher is here and is calling you&rdquo; (v. 28). There is no indication in this chapter that the Lord Jesus called for Mary. It was not the Lord who called her; it was Martha. This was not the Lord&rsquo;s intention, but it was Martha&rsquo;s intention. Martha was so full of opinions that she took her own opinion as the Lord&rsquo;s will. As a result, Mary was called to the Lord. As soon as she saw the Lord, her first word was a complaint also: &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (v. 32). Mary also had opinions.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not say anything further. It was useless for Him to say anything. He just asked them about the tomb, so they took Him to the tomb. The Jews who were present were also full of opinions, and the Lord Jesus was troubled because of them. The Lord was not sad because of Lazarus. I believe that such an environment of opinions made the Lord Jesus weep. Their condition was pitiful. Resurrection and life were present, but they did not know Him. He even told them that He is the resurrection and the life, and He also made it clear that Lazarus would rise again (v. 23). However, Martha, Mary, and the Jews were distracted and veiled by their many opinions. Therefore, they could not hear the Lord, nor could they see Him. They were indeed pitiful. They could have rejoiced and had peace, but their numerous opinions kept them from knowing the Lord and from hearing Him. Nothing is as strong as opinions in resisting the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life. The Lord often is hindered by human opinions and views.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, the Lord said nothing. He just went to the tomb and asked them to remove the stone. However, Martha had yet another opinion. She said, &ldquo;Lord, by now he smells&rdquo; (v. 39). She seemed to be saying, &ldquo;My brother already smells in the tomb; what use is it to open the tomb?&rdquo; This view was right according to a natural view, a human view. Hence, it was an opinion&mdash;a frustration and a hindrance. From the beginning to the end, Martha was a hindrance to the Lord. All her opinions were a frustration to the Lord. The Lord responded to Martha and her opinion, saying, &ldquo;Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?&rdquo; (v. 40). Then they took away the stone, and the Lord Jesus prayed and thanked God.</p>
<p>Here we need to see a basic principle. In relation to the Lord&rsquo;s saving man, there is no problem on His side. All the problems are the result of opinions. We need to realize that people are like Lazarus inwardly and like Martha outwardly. Inwardly people are dead and full of the odor of death; like Lazarus, they are in death. People need the Lord to save them, and the Lord is able to save them. However, outwardly people have opinions, views, thoughts, and ideas. People are also like Martha. Human opinions, views, thoughts, and ideas are the strongest hindrance to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life; they prevent people from receiving the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. When people drop their opinions, it is easy for them to receive the salvation of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life is in the Spirit, and this salvation has been placed before every person, but the greatest obstacle to resurrection life is the human mind. People often hinder the Lord with their thoughts. If you can set your opinions aside, the great power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life will be manifested in you. Your opinions frustrate the great power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life from being manifested in you. The &ldquo;Martha&rdquo; in you is too strong. You must drop your opinions. Anyone who is willing to drop his opinions, intents, views, and perspectives will have the power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life manifested in his being.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
