   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REIGNING ASPECT OF THE MATURED ISRAEL 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to Genesis 41, which unfolds more of the details of Joseph's life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of a mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the representative of such a life, he is an excellent type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is rare to find in the Old Testament such a complete and full type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, on the one hand, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life and, on the other hand, typifies Christ in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Throughout the record of Joseph's life there are two lines: the line of the type of Christ and the line of the secret of the reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we shall consider further the line of Joseph as a type of Christ, and in the next we shall consider the line of the secret of the reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In previous messages we have covered eight aspects of Joseph as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we shall cover seven more aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>9 Resurrected from the Prison of Death</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Joseph typified Christ as the One resurrected from the prison of death 41:14; Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ was not arrested and cast into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, He walked willingly into prison, that is, He went into the prison of death voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although He entered into death willingly, the gates of Hades, which is the power of death, the authority of darkness, immediately rose up and sought to keep Him there forever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as Acts 2:24 says, it was impossible for Him to be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ stayed in the prison of death for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During those days, the power of death did its best to imprison Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Christ could not be held by death because He is resurrection John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Which is more powerful death or resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Resurrection is definitely more powerful than death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, death could not hold Christ, who was not only life, but also resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Christ walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To Him, this walking out of death was His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As Joseph was released from the dungeon, so Christ was also released from the prison of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All Christians should be familiar with three things: the incarnation of Christ, the crucifixion of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe that we in the churches know these three matters.</S>
