   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS FROM SWATOW, KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peace to Brother Chia Ju:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received both your telegram and letter and have read them both.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sisters Ruth Lee and Liu Hui Fen both arrived here safely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>More than ten people went onto the boat to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Shantung steamer arrived early Wednesday, so that evening the sisters gathered at the meeting hall for some fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although there was no message, all the sisters felt very satisfied and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On Thursday the sisters received people individually for the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both those who take the table and those who do not could speak with them individually.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On Friday and Saturday evenings there were meetings on the topic of general salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were more than two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mrs. Nee and Miss Sun P'ei Fen did the translation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Miss Lee plans to go to Tai Shan for a week after the twenty-sixth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then she will return to Swatow, from where she will go on to Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From Monday through Friday of this week, there were two meetings, morning and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the morning, we had a message meeting on a specific topic that began at 9:00.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The topic was John 6:63.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The evening meeting began at 7:00 and was for answering questions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sisters asked questions concerning spiritual life and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Questions on spiritual life included, "How do we hear God's voice?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How do we know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How do we obey? etc."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Questions on practices included such things as head covering, not cutting one's hair, etc. There were about two hundred people in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did a marvelous work, and many believers were built up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not long after, ten more people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now there are twenty brothers and forty-one sisters who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May we praise the Father because He has begun a good work in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the glory should be given to our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With regards to the building of a meeting hall, we are going ahead with our planning, on the one hand, and asking God for His provision, on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past month, we have received more than three hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our plan requires two thousand five hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are short about two thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we are not discouraged by the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We believe that our God will make it up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is just a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Miss Lee's opinion, we can ask God to fulfill our goal in two ways: One is for the assembly to collect the offerings and build the meeting hall --then we would not have to pay monthly rent; the other is for some of the believers one or a few to build a simple hall and rent it to the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The assembly would pay monthly rent, but it would be cheaper than renting a place from a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is better to ask the Lord to open up one of these two ways than to only ask Him to open one way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However God chooses to accomplish His will is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is your opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please tell us what you think.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of the two ways mentioned above, the second is better.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have heard that Brother Nee will be going to Kuling in Foochow for the summer.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is this true?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have only heard rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he comes to Fukien, will he pass through Swatow and go to Hong Kong?</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Miss Lee says that Shen Ting Ling is very ill and vomits blood and feels dizzy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, this brother loves the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He lives every day on the cross, deals with the self-life, and is always making new progress.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May God preserve his life because both Brother Nee and I want to invite him to Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the Lord wills, it will be accomplished.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You can write it to me on his behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am afraid that he cannot hold a pen.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am grateful to you for spending this time.</S>

   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I do not know if I can or not.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The people in the denominations hate me and say I steal lambs, so I am not very free.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We only ask God to open the way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I will leave the rest of the matters to my next letter.</S>
