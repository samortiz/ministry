Timothy 2 Timothy and Titus the three T books in the New Testament are Epistles written by Paul to his two young coworkers Timothy and Titus
These are three aspects of one purpose, that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God
Christ being life is a reality, His being the life-giving Spirit is a reality, and His being the resurrection is yet another reality
The Word becoming flesh is a reality the Lords death and resurrection are a reality and the Lord being the lifegiving Spirit is a reality
As resurrection life, Christ becomes our sanctification, He becomes the power to sanctify us, and He becomes our overcoming life
Timothy 3:15-16 says, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
Faith refers to faith in Christ, and truth refers to the reality of all things in the economy of God as revealed in the New Testament
Timothy 2:15 says, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
The truth is the reality of the contents of the faith, and economy refers to the household administration of God
Another emphasis in the three 'T' books is Paul's charge to Timothy not to teach differently from God's economy
In his Epistles Paul spoke many things to Timothy but the most personal comment that he made to Timothy was Let no one despise your youth
Rather, we should read them carefully and enter into each verse as if these Epistles were written to us personally
Even though Timothy was a young man Paul charged him not to let others despise his youth in word in conduct in love in faith and in purity
If the gift in us can be quickly fanned into flame but can only be sustained for five minutes, we are childish
We need to exercise so that our coldness lasts no longer than two minutes, but our being on fire lasts for twenty-five years
If we can continue to be on fire for ten or twenty years without getting cold, we are not childish; we have some maturity
A young coworker took these words and spoke in a meeting saying Once a person becomes an elder his wife immediately becomes the first lady
Not taking into account our age or the age of the ones whom we are speaking to will cause others to despise our youth
When we pay attention to our age as well as the age of others, our speaking will be appropriate and no one will despise our youth
Paul used a soldier and an athlete as analogies to indicate that the Lord's serving ones must have proper character
A person with poor character likes vain talk; once he starts a phone conversation, he cannot put the phone down
Xing refers to something inherent, and ge refers to something that is manifested; these two aspects form our character
If a Chinese child is raised by Americans and grows up in an American society, he will acquire an American character
According to my estimation, a person's character is determined thirty percent by nature and seventy percent by nurture
On the one hand, we should not let anyone despise our youth; on the other hand, we must cultivate a proper character
The majority of these saints are between twenty-five and thirty-five years old, and they need to be trained in all aspects
Today's Christianity depends on theology, which is of no profit in accomplishing God's economy; hence, we cannot take the way of theology
If there were no written word, God could not put forth the revelation concerning life and concerning the Spirit
If we merely listen to messages to gain knowledge, we are taking a way that is not according to the Lord's leading
We should pursue the truth by studying the Recovery Version and the Life-studies, but we should never consider this as our theology
The problems in Christianity began around the second or third century when the church fathers developed a theology from the Bible
Even though some people advocate the creed and consider it to be according to the Bible, the creed is not as complete as the Bible
Although scholars spend much effort to study the writing style of the Bible, rarely can one describe the style clearly
Christian theology is even general in the way it says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist simultaneously
Due to the incompleteness of the creeds, the British Brethren declared that they wanted the Bible, not the creeds
Later the Southern Baptist Church, one of the largest denominations in America, also declared that they wanted the Bible, not the creeds
The creeds are not wrong, but because they are incomplete, they unavoidably cause people to err in their understanding
In 1984 the Southern Baptist Church put out a publication with a list of all orthodox Christian groups, and we were included in this list
The theology in various denominations in Christianity is not pure, but the truths in the Lord's recovery are entirely based on the Bible
After 1939 Brother Nee saw that the fact of our co-death with Christ in Romans 6 can only be experienced in the Spirit revealed in Romans 8
Mere reckoning does not avail; we must be in the Spirit, because the fact of our co-death with Christ is only in the Spirit
In this book Brother Nee said that we did not have official apostles who establish churches; hence, no elders can be officially appointed
In these messages he said that there are still apostles today and that an apostle is one who is sent out by the Lord
Since there are apostles, there are churches that are established by the apostles and elders who are appointed by them
If a person cares for the creeds, it is not possible for him to change, and neither is it possible for him to advance
Although many denominations stress the creeds over the Bible, they cannot deny the fact that the Bible is a higher authority
Your foundation in the Bible is not solid; therefore, we need to rise up and catch up, putting in a good deal of effort to study the Bible
You should serve in coordination with the brothers and sisters in your locality and spend half a day to study the Bible
Concerning your service, there is the work with children, the work on school campuses, and the gospel work in the community
When we serve in coordination with the brothers in the church, we should keep the principle of having no opinion
As we begin to serve the Lord, we should not only read the Bible and study the truth but also be trained in character for the Lord's service
The first and primary condition to cultivate a character for the Lord's service is to go against our disposition
The language is of a high standard, and it is based on manuscripts that are more accurate than those used for the King James Version
It took us a significant amount of time to translate the Recovery Version into English, and we are still revising it
The way to give a message that will stir up people's interest is to speak according to the Bible, that is, to speak by expounding the Bible
Another burden of the training, which will be brought up in subsequent fellowship, is that every full-timer should help a small group
We need to see that in order to avoid doing things in a natural way in the small groups, the small groups need the help
In the training we will be perfected to help the small groups, after which we will be assigned to a small group
If our attitude is that we know how to help people and, hence, we are the coach, what we do will become organizational
A brother may say that we need to turn to our spirit, eat in spirit, and bring everyone into Christ through eating
We can simply eat with them, not expecting to do anything, because there is not much we can do under that kind of atmosphere
There is some feeling in them, but how deep and how strong their feeling is depends on how much weight we have before the Lord
Gradually, the small groups will be delivered from the natural way of doing things, and people will receive the supply of life from us
The church is making a turn in its practice from corporate meetings involving all the saints to meetings in small groups
Even though human beings tend to be gregarious, we live in households as the basic unit; we do not live in groups
On the one hand we have preached the gospel baptized people and led many to salvation but on the other hand not many of these have remained
Church history and world history show that the existence of any large group is based on small units within the group
Whether a local church is strong or weak depends on how the church takes care of teaching shepherding caring for and supporting the saints
Because we did not take care of these matters in the past, all the ones saved through us either died or were adopted by others
The co-workers and elders in Taipei must realize that the building up of the church is entirely dependent on the small groups
The believers in Jerusalem met from house to house, but Acts 8:1 refers to 'the church which was in Jerusalem'
In chapter 15 when a problem arose in the churches, Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to see the elders and the apostles
There is the need for every group to function and take care of the responsibility of teaching, shepherding, care, and support
The responsibility of teaching, shepherding, care, and support must be transferred to the groups and borne by the groups
If a local church can take good care of teaching, shepherding, care, and support, it will grow in life and be full of vigor
There are many details involved, because there should be teaching, shepherding, care, and support in the small groups
We should not even adopt the term that we are 'helpers,' because no matter what term we use, it will mistakenly be used as a title
Most saints go to work every day to make a living, but the full-timers are carefree because the church supports them
Even though the daughter has not yet learned to cook, she will often try to instruct her mother to do this or that
If damaging words come out of our mouth when we enter the home, we should not expect the mother to listen to us in the meeting
We should not play politics when we speak with others; rather, we should live in the spirit and fellowship with the Lord
When we see a baby crawling on the floor, we should not speak too much lest we express our opinions, but we should not sit silently either
Even if it is difficult to endure the silence, we should never start anything; we should simply be in the meeting
We are being trained to be on time but when we go out to serve we should always remember that the brothers and sisters have not been trained
We thank the Lord and rejoice to see that the majority of the full-time trainees are under thirty-five years of age
In addition, we should depart from unrighteousness , refuse a factious man , and refuse profane and old-womanish myths
We will know which things to turn away from, which things to avoid, which things to depart from, and which things to refuse
If it requires one or two years to learn how to play basketball, it is even more necessary to practice in the matter of serving the Lord
We are not clear concerning how to go on in the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, and the gatherings in the small groups
It is inappropriate to teach in the Lord's table meeting, the prayer meeting, or the gospel meeting; teaching involves fellowship
In order to shepherd people, one must know how to teach, and in order to teach effectively, one must be a shepherd
For this reason, it is necessary to use the Bible when we fellowship in the small groups; otherwise, we can neither teach nor shepherd
In the fellowship meeting of the small groups we can use the Recovery Version and the Life-study messages as materials
The Bible is a book of life, the history of the Bible supports the line of life, and the characters in the Bible are illustrations of life
Far, we have spent eleven years writing the Life-study of the New Testament, taking life as the focus and the line
It is not so easy to understand the words in the Bible, because the Bible contains a vast number of special terms
When we use the Bible, it is best to use the text and the Life-study messages, rather than focusing on the footnotes or the cross references
Initially, the saints may be interested in reading it, but if we try to explain the word holy in great detail, they may not understand it
When we come together, we should greet one another spontaneously and have a spirit of mutual concern, mutual teaching, and mutual care
To pursue the truth in fellowship during a small group meeting, we can use the Recovery Version as much as it is needed
The purpose of reading the Recovery Version is to help the saints understand the Bible see light in the truth and receive the supply of life
In the small group there may be time to read only four verses, but in our preparation we should prepare more verses
If someone in the small group meeting asks about the meaning of the Spirit of holiness, we can explain, but not in the way of a study
We can also say that if the saints want to know more, they can get a copy of the Recovery Version and study it
Or we can select a different portion from the message that concerns Christ and read it together to emphasize life and not truth
In this case we may say to the others The book of Romans shows that the Lord Jesus today is not the same as He was with Peter James and John
Today He has passed through death and resurrection and has become the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us and to be our life practically
After the fellowship we can give a three to five sentence summary, such as, 'Paul's word in this portion is a crystallized speaking
When the co-workers go to help the saints, it is important to have a strong spirit, be 'thick-skinned,' and not have any opinions
In a strong local church every brother and sister is useful and capable of going out to battle and of functioning as a prophet and a teacher
In the meetings we should not read the footnotes in a rigid way; it is sufficient to read only the main points
It would be quite substantial if in twenty-six gatherings a year the light from the truth is released and life is supplied
Those of us who have more growth in life must bear the responsibility to pray and be filled with a praying spirit
Rather, you should forget your self-consciousness, your face, and everything else, and concentrate on the ball and getting it into the hoop
You may use the Lifestudy messages and the Recovery Version in the small groups but when you use the footnotes you should not be too rigid
When you use the Life-study messages in the small groups, the less you explain the meaning of the words the better
Life-study messages may contain some words of explanation, which you do not need to read through in their entirety
We must find the major points, and then during the meeting the saints can read a few sections related to the central point
After the major points are read and the central point is emphasized with a brief explanation, there can be some spontaneous fellowship
If we practice marking the places that should be used in the meeting, after six months to a year, we will be experienced and proficient
We should not go to the small group to give an inspirational message; rather, we should learn to apply the material that we have
We even do not need to buy groceries, because all the material is found in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and in the Life-studies
There is no stipulation that we can use only one message; we simply need to pray concerning which paragraphs to use
The focus of remembering the Lord is the enjoyment of the Lord, who became flesh, passed through death and resurrection, and ascended
In the breadbreaking meeting there are two symbols on the table the bread signifying the Lords body and the cup signifying the Lords blood
In the bread-breaking meeting, we remember the incarnated Lord, who passed through human living on the earth and entered into death
He resurrected, ascended to the heights, and became the life-giving Spirit to produce us, the many sons of God, as His Body
Perhaps the sister had a feeling for the hymn because the church was promoting the burden of preaching the gospel and gaining people
In every meeting there is always the operating of the Spirit; nevertheless, the Holy Spirit still needs an outlet
In heaven Jesus sitting, / Christ the Lord is there enthroned; / As the man by God exalted, / With God's glory He is crowned'
The older saints should not constantly reminiscence about the old days, saying that it was like such and such 'in the early days'
The first section of the bread-breaking meeting is to remember the Lord, and the second section is to worship the Father
After there has been much worship and praise to the Father, it is inappropriate to call a hymn concerning the Lord's precious blood
Hymns concerning the Lord's precious blood should be sung while the Lord is remembered and not during the worship of the Father
As he continues to attend the meetings, he will understand the difference between praising the Lord and worshipping the Father
When we give a testimony in the bread-breaking meeting, we must learn to sense the atmosphere of the meeting and not interrupt it
If we expect the number of saints in the church to increase twofold, the number of small groups should also increase twofold
At present there are three hundred sixty groups; a twofold increase means an increase of another three hundred sixty groups
The responsible brothers in the twenty-one halls should begin to prepare and plan how to divide the halls into districts and groups
Besides this, there should also be a way to keep attendance so that we know who comes to the meetings regularly
There are twenty-one halls in the church in Taipei, but there are only seven hundred saints in the prayer meetings
We have considered the two sections of the bread-breaking meeting: for the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of the Father
Based on the revelation of the Bible, Bible teachers throughout the centuries have used the noun Trinity and the adjective Triune
Since human language is based on human culture, if there is no culture, words will not be produced to match it
On the one hand, the Bible shows that God is one; on the other hand, the Bible shows the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ the Son, who passed through death and resurrection, is the last Adam who became the life-giving Spirit
Some people overstress the aspect of God being three and deny the aspect of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit being one
Bible scholars and theologians over the centuries all agree that God is one, but there is indeed the aspect of His being three
There is a distinction between the Father and the Son, but we cannot separate the two, because the two are one and cannot be separated
Orthodox theologians only say that God is three and yet one, and that there is a distinction between the three
With regard to the essential aspect of the Triune God He is revealed as one and with regard to the economical aspect He is revealed as three
They quote verses such as Matthew 3:16-17 and John 17:1 to prove that the Father and the Son are distinct and separate
As we worship the Father we are following the Son the firstborn Son of God who is leading many sons to worship the Father this is economical
According to the context, the Lord Jesus and His disciples sang a hymn, and they sang it in praise to the Father
Although the phrase after singing a hymn is simple, many times simple phrases in the Bible express important points
When the Lord Jesus established His supper, He was burdened, preparing to deliver Himself into the hands of those who would kill Him
As the only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God on the day of His resurrection
In His resurrection all those who believe into Him were also begotten as the many sons of God, His many brothers
On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, Peter denied the Lord three times , and the others were disappointed and fled
Because of what the Lord accomplished on the morning of His resurrection, He was not ashamed to call them His brothers
In which Christian meeting is it most suitable for the Lord Jesus to sing hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church?
Rather, it is the believers coming to the Lord's table and taking the Lord as everything to enjoy the Lord and thus remember Him
The light concerning the worship of the Father was first seen by the Brethren over one hundred fifty years ago and was passed on to us
The church fathers and early Bible scholars focused their study of the Bible on the Triune God and the person of Christ
The views of orthodox Bible scholars were more or less the same, but they could not come to a precise conclusion
When these points, however, are written as articles in the creed, the complete, thorough, and sweet taste is altogether lost
There are now a large number of publications, including the Life-study of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament
The essential aspect of the Trinity relates to His existence, whereas the economical aspect of the Trinity relates to His move
Almost all the fundamental Bible scholars over the centuries acknowledge these two aspects: the essential and the economical
These are the three steps of the move of the Triune God: the Father's plan, the Son's accomplishment, and the Spirit's application
The essential aspect of the Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment; the economical aspect is for our service and worship
We should never think that since the Father the Son and the Spirit are one our worship of the Father is the same as our remembering the Lord
No matter how much Christianity is in confusion, our teaching is according to the sixty-six books of the pure Word of God
In the table meeting we must follow the Spirit to remember the Lord, and then we must follow the Lord and the Spirit to worship the Father
The last group of hymns in our hymnal under the category of 'Worship of the Father' is titled 'His Praise from Many Sons'
Because it is difficult to have a Christian prayer meeting, the attendance in the prayer meeting of almost all Christian groups is low
Every person who prays knows that individual prayer has a certain taste but that prayer in a meeting has a strong and rich taste
We cannot expect attendance in the prayer meeting to increase without spending time before the Lord by ourselves
If a family member is very sick, a saint can look for an opportunity to fellowship this matter by following the leading of the Holy Spirit
They may have a relative or a friend who needs to be saved and needs the intercession of the saints in the prayer meeting
The more we pray, the more living the prayer becomes, and the more we pray, the higher and stronger the prayer becomes
When a full-timer goes to a small group, he should not assume the status of a full-timer or display the air of a full-timer
In order to help the fellowship in a small group, he should first help the saints learn how to read the Word of God
When others saw that the dormitory room was clean, they had a positive impression of the person who cleaned it
If we are put in a place that is dirty, we should not merely accept it; rather, we should rise up to make the place clean and respectable
The study of the Bible began in the second century after the apostles had died by the end of the first century
In the second century many lovers of the Lord and scholarly men were raised up by the Lord, and they began to study the Bible
The situation in Christianity today is pitiful because people pay more attention to theology than to the Bible
Some of Scofield's contemporaries founded a seminary in Dallas, Texas, and its teaching of theology is based on Scofield's views
When the Brethren were raised up, however, they studied the Bible, consulting traditional theology, but they were not bound by tradition
To be traditional is to receive what has been passed down from our predecessors without seeing any new light from the Bible
What the missionaries from the West expounded influenced the truths that we initially released in the local churches
The saints in the Lord's recovery should learn the truths concerning the essential and economical aspects of the Trinity
Not only so, in eternity past God the Father ordained that His Son would become a man, die on behalf of men, and accomplish God's redemption
God also ordained that the Spirit would apply to us what God the Father planned and what God the Son accomplished
When He was baptized in the river Jordan the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and God the Father spoke from the heavens this was economical
With regard to His economy, there is the aspect of the move of the three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
We could never come to a conclusion as to what a person looks like if we see him only from the front or the back
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, His disciple Philip said to Him, 'Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us'
The last Adam is the incarnated Lord, who passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
If we say that the life-giving Spirit is not the Holy Spirit, then is there a second Spirit who came to give life besides the Holy Spirit?
On the other hand, it speaks of the essential aspect of the Trinity in relation to God Himself, God's existence
When the Lord Jesus came to the earth to accomplish God's work, He stood in the water; this was part of His move
When the Spirit descended like a dove, this was also part of His move, and when the Father spoke from the heavens, this was part of His move
You should not expect to accomplish something in a quick way or even to do something well in your first attempt
If we desire to succeed in anything, we must be like the tortoise; we must be patient and willing to spend time to labor persistently
Depending on the arrangement in your locality, you should serve in coordination with the church in the afternoon
The denominations in Christianity have a system of examinations and promotions, but we do not have any examinations or promotions
In today's society, if a person is not aggressive, he will not be promoted, nor will he be able to keep his job
The Chinese Union Version is a smooth and elegant translation, and its language is full of rhythm; however, in some places it lacks accuracy
The first page of this explanation consisted of the Greek alphabet with a pronunciation guide in both Mandarin and English
When Japan invaded China, the Japanese army put many Western missionaries into concentration camps and sold their books
One of these works, Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, is a ten-volume set by a German brother, Gerhard Kittel
When we go out to contact people, our attitude, expression, speaking, and conduct have much to do with serving the Lord
If we are proper in these aspects, we will give others the impression that we are a weighty person who does not act rashly or frivolously
We are not uplifting ourselves, but when we speak for the Lord, we are what Paul calls an ambassador of Christ
If the two hundred full-timers are aggressive to learn, even your hairstyle and clothing will show others your quality
All these things are related to your serving the Lord; hence, you must be aggressive, not casual, in everything
Similarly, our ability to know people depends on two factors: how much we have learned and how much we know the spirit of others
For this reason, when you return to your locality, you must be aggressive and make progress so that others will respect you
The brothers and sisters need a broad heart, and they need to be considerate of the weak saints who have not been meeting for a while
We need a broad and patient heart, and we need to follow the Lord's leading in the situation to render him some help
Some of them might already have formed habits that are difficult to break; nevertheless, we must not cut them off
You must be positive, concerned, and burdened but at the same time realize that you must not be hasty in the situation and circumstance
The saints may not be able to match your burden; hence, you need to give the Lord some time to raise up the proper atmosphere
Some trees may not grow so well for a time, but after a while an opportunity will arise, and the timing will be right
We do not wish to make such things into rules, because the church is the Lord's organic Body; everything in the church depends on life
