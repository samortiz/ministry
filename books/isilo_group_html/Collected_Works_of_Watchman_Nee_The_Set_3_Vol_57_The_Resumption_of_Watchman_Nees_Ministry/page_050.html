Only this book tells us the way the Holy Spirit led men in their works. This book speaks of the Lord's approving and His disapproving as well. In some places it says that the Holy Spirit said this and that, and in other places it says that Timothy and Titus were assigned to this and that place. In addition, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are also epistles on the work, and they follow the same principle as Acts. From Acts and these Epistles we can see that there is the side of individual leading and there is the side of corporate leading. But the majority of the leadings there are corporate leadings. In Acts 2, when Peter stood up, the other eleven stood up with him. What Peter said became the words of all of them. He told the crowd to be baptized for the washing away of their sins. After his word, no one said anything more. John did not stand up and say, "Peter, save some room for me to speak.'' The failure of Catholicism lies in the fact that it does not give any place to the conscience and does not give any place to the reality of the Holy Spirit; the church becomes the highest monopolizing institution. The recovery of Protestantism is the recovery of the individual. However, because it is a recovery of the individual, anything that has to do with the leading of the way of the church is solved by committees, votes, and resolutions. However, real leading does not come through committees, resolutions, and debates, but in a spontaneous, unorchestrated, yet harmonious way. Where there is the reality of the Spirit, there will be no problem with the leading. The real leading is produced under the oneness of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Acts tells us that when there was need among the churches in Samaria, Jerusalem sent men to help them (Acts 8:14). When the few brothers in the church in Antioch prayed, the Holy Spirit set apart two of them for His work. If it were up to us, we would have much consideration about the way to spread to Europe and the way to work. However, Acts shows us that it is not a matter of consideration, but a matter of the corporate leading.</p><h2 class="head2">Leading Being a Matter in the Body</h2><p>At the time of Paul's conversion, even God's speaking to him was through the church. The Lord spoke to Paul not only directly, but through the members as well. Why did the Lord have to speak to Paul through others? If I have something to say to Brother Yu-zhi, I can say it to him directly; I do not have to convey it through another person. But here was Paul, who was zealous in serving God, who shed others' blood and thought that by so doing he was serving God. One day God cast a great light on him and turned his life around. Why would the Lord not speak to such a person directly? He sent others to speak to him instead. Moreover, He did not send Peter, John, or Philip; He sent Ananias. No one had heard of Ananias before that time or after that time. The Lord sent a seemingly ordinary believer to Paul. This shows us that leading is a matter of the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">God Speaking to the Whole Body</h2><p>John's ministry is on God's house, Peter's ministry is on God's kingdom, and Paul's ministry is on God's church. With Paul we see that he touched something from the first day on&mdash;the oneness of the Lord with His church. The Head is one with the members, and the members are one with each other. Paul learned these two lessons from the beginning. He saw the life of the Body from the first day. This is why he was able to drop his self and accept the commission of the work, and why he was later able to commission others in the work. This shows us that God's speaking is not directed toward individuals, but toward the whole Body.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
