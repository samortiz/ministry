After we have handed over our all, we will gain new possessions gradually. We do not expect to gather much when we sow; we simply let go when we sow. Nevertheless, it is a fact that we will gather much. What then should we do? Second Corinthians 8 and 9 come after Acts 2 and 4, not before. In 2 Corinthians, we find the words He who gathered much had no excess. This is not a question of whether a man has sold his all, but a question of what a man does after he has sold his all. We have to empty ourselves of everything at least once, but as new income is received, we have to empty again. As God blesses us and increases our income, we surely have to pour out more. Those who sow abundantly should not be in excess. The more absolutely a person deals with the matter of mammon, the faster his money will come back to him. A brother once remarked, "We can never beat God in His work." God's emphasis is on "he who gathered much had no excess;" His emphasis is not on "he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap" (2 Cor. 9:6). This is not a matter of reaping with blessing, but a matter of not having excess. No matter how much income we receive, God wants us to maintain the practice of not having excess. We must deal with money in an absolute way. Before the Lord, we must continually give away our money.</p><p>The five points above concern a Christian's attitude towards money, as seen in the New Testament. This is our way of dealing with mammon. We have to deal with mammon in an absolute way. Today a Christian should begin his pathway of revival from his experience of deliverance from mammon. We have to be delivered from mammon.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO MANAGE THE OFFERING</h2><p>In the future, we have to learn from God's Word how we should handle our finances and how our private money should be separated from the work's money. We have a few guidelines concerning this for our co-workers when they set out for their work.</p><p>First, we should give to the brothers who are in want or to poor people in general.</p><p>Second, we should care for the needs of individual brothers and sisters. Those who are making the offering can write down the name of a certain brother on an envelope and drop it in the offering box in care of the responsible brothers.</p><p>Third, we should care for the need of our own church.</p><p>Fourth, we should care for the need of other churches.</p><p>Fifth, we should support the need of the work within our own region. Churches are local, while the work is regional. A few places combined together form a region. In the New Testament we find two regions of work&mdash;Jerusalem and Antioch. The twelve apostles had Jerusalem as their center. Paul and the other apostles had Antioch as their center. Paul said that they boasted according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure had apportioned to them (2 Cor. 10:13). For years we were clear about the locality being the sphere of a local church, but we were not clear about the work. Now finally we are clear. There are regions of work. The work in Samaria was under Jerusalem. The work in Pamphylia was under Antioch. This shows us clearly that there are regions of work. If there is not a clear distinction between the local church and the work, we will be confused as soon as there are some kind of shake-ups. We have to remember that the church is confined to a locality, while the work extends to a region. Elders are appointed for the care of the local churches, while apostles are raised up for the work of a region. The Bible is very clear about this. It is only man who is not clear about this.</p><p>Sixth, we should also take care of the need of other regions of work. A normal relationship should exist between various regions of work. Jerusalem and Antioch were not cut off one from the other. A relationship and a fellowship existed between them. Antioch was raised up by Barnabas, who came from Jerusalem. Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch and brought Paul to Jerusalem from Antioch. When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent relief. In Acts we find a close relationship between these two regions. They fellowshipped not only in spiritual matters but in material needs as well.</p><p>Presently, we have two regions of work in China&mdash;Foochow and Shanghai. After the eighth month of the Chinese calendar we hope to start the work in Tsingtao or Tientsin as well, linking Tsingtao with Shanghai. Following this we will move on to Kwangtung and Kwangsi through Canton. During the past few days, P'ing Yang in southern Chekiang as well as Swatow in Kwangtung have both had a start. There are twenty-six to twenty-seven counties around Swatow with brothers and sisters speaking the Hakka dialect. Therefore, the work among the Hakka people must be centered around Swatow. The work is regional. The failure in our work in the past was in making the work local. We have to consider our work from the perspective of the whole region. The workers have to bear more responsibility in such regions. Brother Witness Lee is bearing the responsibility of the work in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Ke-san is bearing the responsibility of the work in Foochow.</p><p>These are six different ways to handle our personal finances. Some people think that we are centralizing the management of finances and that we are turning over our money to the control of one person. We never have had such a thought in our mind.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
