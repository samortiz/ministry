   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I thank the Lord for the rich blessing, even the particular blessing, that He has bestowed upon this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through the ministry and fellowship in this conference, Ephesians 1 has become much more clear to me in three points: first, in the triune dispensing of the Divine Trinity; second, in the unique transmitting of the transcending Christ; and third, in the spirit of wisdom and revelation, through which we can realize and participate in the triune dispensing and the unique transmitting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these three matters I believe that the Lord will have a way to carry out His economy in this consummated age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do look to the Lord that He would show us that His triune dispensing is to produce continuously the materials, components, and constituents of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After this, there is the need of the transcending Christ's unique transmitting to put all the materials, components, and constituents together to have a constitution, which is the organism of the Triune God, the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the unique way for us to touch, see, realize, comprehend, and even participate in and enjoy both the constituents and the constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From now on the goal among us for the Lord's recovery should be just to humble ourselves, telling the Lord that we have been very poor in His recovery for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been distracted in many ways and affected by many things, and have even been to some extent captured by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord forgives us, and now His mercy with His grace still takes care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that this conference has been a great caring of the Head for us as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the vision among us is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we must forget about the past and forget about what we know and have a new beginning with a renewed practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pray much for our spirit: "Lord, now I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a crucial book as Ephesians, You unveiled to us Your triune dispensing and Your unique transmitting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time You also unveiled to us how much You expect that we all could have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank You, Lord, that You inspired Your apostle Paul to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While he was ministering to us the threefold dispensing and the unique transmitting, he prayed; he inserted a prayer into his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He prayed for us desperately, that our God as the Father would give to us a spirit of wisdom and revelation."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The divisions and the confusions among God's chosen people did not begin with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we read the Acts and the Epistles along with the book of Revelation, we will see a picture, a portrait, of the divisions and confusions that existed even before the end of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul was martyred before A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before his martyrdom he wrote 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In that book we can see the confusion and division that existed at that time 1:15; 2:16-18; 3:1-9; 4:3-4, 10, 14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only so, even in Galatians and Philippians Paul showed us that at his time there were not only divisions but also rivalries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some brothers were competing against Paul Gal 1:6-7; 3:1; 4:13-17; 6:12; Phil 1:15-18, 28; 2:20-21; 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The situation that is among us today existed also in Paul's time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not think that the degree of trouble in Paul's time was lower than in ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today it seems that there is not a person who is doing evil things to the degree that Alexander the coppersmith did evil to the apostle Paul 2 Tim 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we should not be disappointed with the present confusing and dividing situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we should be very encouraged and very grateful to the Lord that in such an age He has visited us and brought us into the recovery and has been with us these many years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, in this conference the Lord has shown us something further, deeper, higher, and richer in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What the Lord has shown us surpassed my expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through the six chapters in this book we have a clear sky to show us that in the entire universe there is a threefold dispensing of the processed Triune God not the "raw" God, not the God who was only in His divinity in eternity past, but the Triune God who has been processed to dispense Himself in a threefold way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He came out of eternity with His divinity to enter into humanity, and He was even born of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He passed through such an incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a process it was for Him as the almighty, infinite, eternal God to become a small man, even to lie in a manger and to grow gradually according to the principles of His creation!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His creation God ordained many principles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Human birth takes place according to God's regulation, God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His birth as a man He kept all those ordinations, and then He remained in a poor carpenter's home for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After ministering for three and a half years, He willingly entered into death to visit Hades, and there He overcame death and put down Hades, and He walked out from that place and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His resurrection He accomplished a number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second, He was willing to be born again with His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God, thus opening the gate so that the Father could have many sons with both humanity and divinity Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to 1 Peter 1:3, in His birth He begot millions of God's chosen people in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He, with the Father's divine economy, transcended all the oppositions in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He transcended Hades, the human opposition on the earth, and the evil angelic opposition in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He transcended far above all to sit at the right hand of His Father, the Almighty in this universe Eph 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only so, the Father subjected all things under His feet and gave Him a great gift, that is, to be the Head over all things to the church v. 22 . Now, all that He accomplished in His transcending is to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The little word to in Ephesians 1:22 implies transmission.</S>
