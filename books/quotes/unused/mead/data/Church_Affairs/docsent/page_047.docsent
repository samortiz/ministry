   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LOCAL CHURCH, THE WORK,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the relationship between the local church and the work?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the relationship between the local church and the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We want to pay special attention to these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Local churches such as those in Jerusalem and Antioch are special and exceptional because, on the one hand, they are local churches, and on the other hand, they are centers for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As local churches they are the same as other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As to the work they are also centers for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we have to recognize that Jerusalem and Antioch are somewhat different from other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, regarding other local churches, what is their relationship with the work?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In The Normal Christian Church Life we made quite an effort to show the brothers and sisters that the local church is the highest authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord has not established a federated church, a mother church, or a head church above the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no such concept in the Bible as a mother church or a head church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible only a local church is recognized as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, the local church is recognized in the Bible as the unique unit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no authority above her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ELDERS BEING THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IN A LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a local church the highest authority is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the matters are handled by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostles cannot directly interfere with a local church; they cannot deal with the affairs of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, there was a person in Corinth who needed to be removed, and yet Paul could not remove him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a very crucial example.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you see from this the relationship between the local church and the work, as well as the relationship between the local church and the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, what the apostles want to do must go through the elders; the things which the apostles want to do cannot be done directly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has not asked a local church to receive the commands of the apostles directly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God only asks the brothers and sisters in a local church to receive the commands of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the spiritual condition of an elder is right, he should receive the commands of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the spiritual side the elders should listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Elders Being Appointed by the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to pay special attention to the point that the apostles appoint the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The elders in all the localities are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Timothy and Titus were apostles; they were sent by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two, one in Ephesus and one in Crete, traveled in the surrounding areas and appointed elders in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the authority of the elders is not received from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must make the churches in the various localities see that not one local overseer is elected locally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My father is my father not because I voted for him, but because I was born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said, You did not choose Me, but I chose you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders are not chosen by the brothers in the church but are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A local church should not select elders; it has neither the authority nor the knowledge to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The local brothers are absolutely not allowed to select some to oversee them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What God has shown us is that it was Paul, Timothy, and Titus who appointed elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The elders are appointed by the workers from without.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Church Listening to the Elders and</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>the Elders Learning to Listen to the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once a local church has had elders appointed, it should listen to the elders, not to Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders are the overseers of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The highest authority in a local church is the elders; however, the authority of the elders is received from the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The apostles give the authority to the elders, and the elders administrate the local church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, everyone who is an elder, an overseer, must learn to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because their being elders is due to the apostles, they cannot overthrow the authority of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is all right for the church not to receive the commands of the apostles directly, but it is not all right for the church not to receive the commands of the elders directly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, the elders need to learn to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what God has arranged with respect to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Being the Ones to Remove the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the meeting in Hangkow, some brothers misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They thought that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they did not have to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When there were brothers who did not respect the elders and problems occurred, the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, the authority for the appointment of the elders is with the apostles, and the authority for the removal of the elders is also with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A local church cannot expel an elder; rather, the apostles need to bear the responsibility of removing elders.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the reason why the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Why is there the need of two or three people?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because this is not a matter of personal opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some people speak loosely, and this is not allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is the need of a letter of accusation by two or three in order to oppose a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This makes it a sufficiently troublesome matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At least two or three accusers are needed to accuse an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why is a letter of accusation used instead of spoken words?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Spoken words can easily become rumors; but since a letter of accusation is written down, it can become a formal accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, there must be a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this way, one cannot speak loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Anyone who does things loosely must bear the responsibility for it.</S>
