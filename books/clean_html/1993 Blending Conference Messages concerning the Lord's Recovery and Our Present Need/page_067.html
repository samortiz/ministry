<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The New Jerusalem, the Tabernacle of God,<br>the Wife of the Lamb, as the Ultimate Consummation of All the Matured Saints</H2><P>The ultimate testimony of Jesus is the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God, the wife of the Lamb, as the ultimate consummation of all of God's matured people (Rev. 21:1-3). No matter how stubborn or weak some Christians are today, eventually, all of God's people will be matured. Those who did not do their "homework" in this age, who did not enjoy the processed Triune God in this age, will be matured during the thousand-year kingdom to become the constituents of the New Jerusalem for eternity. But we want to pay the price to be the overcomers in this age who mature earlier to participate in the wedding feast of the Lamb. God in Christ wants us to be overcomers more than we want to be. He is calling us for this so that He can have the wife He desires. This wife is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The New Jerusalem is not a physical city, a heavenly mansion. The book of Revelation is a book of signs. The Lion-Lamb, the seven lampstands, and the universal woman are all signs, not literal, physical things. Christ is not a physical lamb with four feet and with seven eyes (Rev. 5:6). This is a sign. The New Jerusalem is also a sign, the greatest sign, of the ultimate consummation of all of God's people that have been matured through all the ages.</P><P>All God's people will be the eternal manifestation and expression and the total increase of the processed and consummated Triune God in His mingling with all His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified saints. God has been increasing through His dispensing. He has been processed and consummated to dispense Himself into us to make us His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and eventually glorified people. If God had not been processed and consummated, He could not have gotten into us. First, we were redeemed by His blood (Eph. 1:7). Then He entered into us to regenerate our spirit (John 3:6). Now He is transforming us in our soul (Rom. 12:2), and eventually He will transfigure our body to glorify us (Phil. 3:21). The Triune God will saturate our whole being and we will be fully mingled with the Triune God.</P><P>We need to pay our attention to the words processed, consummated, and mingled. God has been processed. God in Christ as the Spirit has been realized by us in our spirit. This is the entering in of the Triune God, who has been consummated as the Spirit. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son has been realized as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. The New Jerusalem is the total increase of the processed and consummated Triune God mingled with His lovers. We love Him, and He is being mingled with us. He is spreading into our mind, emotion, and will to make us His eternal manifestation and expression.</P><P>The New Jerusalem will be a triumphant show to all the universe, especially to His adversary Satan, of His victory in His infinite grace and wisdom through His redeemed in eternity (Eph. 2:7; 3:10). This is the ultimate and final testimony of Jesus! Hallelujah!</P><P>By that time Satan and all the evil, negative things and persons will be in the lake of fire. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate mingling of God and man will be a triumphant show. Satan will have to look at this city, this bride. Today he bothers us all the time, but he cannot stop God. Through God's infinite grace and wisdom, God will have a triumphant show.</P><P>Ephesians 2:7 says, "That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace." Chapter two begins with man being dead in offenses and sins (v. 1). After the fall, man became dead in his spirit. Satan and his evil angels were above him (v. 2). He was lost in the world, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts. These fallen men are by nature children of wrath (v. 3). Man is corrupt, full of sin. Satan has brought man down to the bottom. But God was rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us (v. 4). He saved us by His grace. Through His dispensing of His rich grace, which is God in Christ as the Spirit flowing into our being, He redeems, regenerates, transforms, and glorifies all of His children. The whole tripartite being of man will be fully one with God. That will be a victorious, triumphant show in the whole universe, and we will be a part of this show. This is the final and ultimate testimony of Jesus. We need to pray, "Lord, make me an overcomer." It is the overcomers who will usher in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the matured saints so that the Lord Jesus can have His final and ultimate testimony.</P><P>8 brothers</P>
