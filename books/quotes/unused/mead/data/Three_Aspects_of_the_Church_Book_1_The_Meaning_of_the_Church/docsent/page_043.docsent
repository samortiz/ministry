   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Boards of the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The boards of the tabernacle were standing boards Exo 26:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle was a portable structure that could be taken apart, freely moved, and then assembled together again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything related to the tabernacle was portable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Forty-eight standing boards framed the tabernacle, or the Tent of Meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the type of the tabernacle there are several important aspects related to the significance of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having Two Natures</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Each board consisted of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As wood overlaid with gold, they had two natures Exo 26:29; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>25:10-11; 36:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gold signifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The nature of God is related to the life of God, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, gold denotes God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In typology wood refers to the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The overlaying of the wood with gold signifies that the church is the mingling of God and man; hence, the church is an entity composed of two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acacia wood is strong in character and high in standard, signifying the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord s humanity is strong and noble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should never think that we have an excuse not to be proper in the church because we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, every genuinely saved one should be acacia wood to the degree that their humanity has been worked on by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the beginning, when the man Adam was created, he was both solid and strong; he was truly acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His thoughts were clear, his judgment was accurate, his will was strong, and his emotions were rich and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, after Satan attacked man, man sinned and fell, and his humanity was ruined and gradually became dark and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire human race became darkened and ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In contrast, after we believed into the Lord, God s salvation not only saved us from sin and the attraction of the world, but also began to remake and reconstitute our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The material that God uses to remake us is higher than the material He used in creating us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God created man, He used the dust of the ground, but when He remakes us, He uses the divine nature, typified by gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, He adds Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, after a person is saved, there should be a change not only in his behavior but also in his character.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After salvation, one who lacked a clear mind should have a clear mind, one who had a weak will should have a strong will, and one whose discernment was improper should have a proper discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acacia wood is high in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His salvation, God wants to save man to a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sadly, it seems that God s salvation has not been manifested much among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we are saved, our character has not been uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who lack a clear mind remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, those with a weak will remain the same, and those with an improper discernment remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our daily life we are neither accurate in our speech nor precise in our timing; moreover, we are neither genuine nor strict.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After our initial salvation, we have not allowed the life of God to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though we are saved, we do not realize that the purpose of God s salvation is to remake us and to change our character.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We think that the purpose of God s life in us is to change our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Formerly we frequently lost our temper, but because of God s life in us, we do not lose our temper as much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consequently we think that this is sufficient, and we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we fail to realize that the purpose of God s life in us is to change our natural character.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have urged the saints to train their character, but few brothers and sisters have experienced much of a change in their character.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This proves that God s life has not had much of an effect upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not sufficient merely to pray; we must also allow the Spirit and the life of God to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if we should refrain from speaking negative things, we still must speak with full assurance and accuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our character must be uplifted and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever we do must be excellent and outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to change from decayed wood to acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is accomplished in God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, if we have not been saved in the matter of our character, we will not be able to discern the truth in the Bible because our character will not be exact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our character must be genuine, exact, and strict.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The kind of Bible we have depends on the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A sloppy person reads the Bible in a sloppy way, whereas an exact person reads the Bible in an exact way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not only true with the reading of the Bible but also in regard to our service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without a change in our character, everything we do will be careless and sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, we will not be of much use in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In serving the Lord, we must allow our redeemed humanity to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the tabernacle, acacia wood typifies the humanity that cooperates with God, the humanity that is high in standard, rather than a fallen humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever we serve, we need to ask ourselves, Is our serving according to acacia wood or decayed wood?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is the way that we determine, handle, arrange, and do things solid and exact, or is it casual and sloppy?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not realize how fallen our nature is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to be saved to see our own condition and to train our character.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The humanity in the church must be acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some people are not exact in their speaking and in their use of time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are sloppy in handling matters, but when they pray, they pray fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result, people think they are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This kind of person should not use prayers to utter empty words but rather to overturn his character.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He should kneel down before the Lord and pray: O Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thoroughly change my loose character.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way, his character will be changed from decayed wood to acacia wood, and the church will be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The tabernacle was able to stand because of the boards, not because of the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Gold is precious, but gold is soft and cannot stand on its own.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The tabernacle could stand only by means of the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Throughout the past two thousand years of church history, the church has been able to stand because of her strong human element.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Martin Luther was a strong person.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was acacia wood, and as such, he was able to stand for the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In 1942 I bought a biography of Brother George M ller.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The book contained a picture of his study.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>From the picture I saw the fine and neat arrangement of his study, and I was filled with admiration.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Consequently, God gave M ller a particular commission for the age in which he lived because he was solid, exact, and strict.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was truly a piece of acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If there are many such people in the church, the church will be able to stand strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is true that the boards of the tabernacle were overlaid with gold, but the firmness of boards was due to the firmness of the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The reason that many local churches are weak is that the brothers and sisters are weak in their humanity; that is, they lack the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In God s eyes, a spiritual person is not a person without humanity but one whose humanity matches God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God is seeking spiritual men in whom there is no lack in their human element and in whom their humanity matches divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Instead of being independent of or detached from God, our humanity must match God and be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A basic principle in God s redemption is that God desires man to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Paul had a strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Madame Guyon, though she was a sister, also had a very strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Likewise because of their strong character, John Bunyan bore a good testimony for the Lord, and J. N. Darby was greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They were acacia wood, strong and firm, and thus were able to stand and bear a glorious testimony for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we want to be useful in the Lord s hand, we must allow God s life and God s Spirit to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Our character can be compared to cement; we must allow the water of the Holy Spirit to mingle with us so that the cement of our character can solidify and become firm.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When our character is firm, we can be useful in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The tabernacle was able to stand because of the stable base of the silver sockets, but it still needed the firm acacia wood as support.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Today the church is able to stand because of the solid base of redemption and a firm humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not have an erroneous concept that everything depends on who God is and what He does and that nothing is related to man or required of man.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God cannot establish a strong church by calling and gathering together a group of young children.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They could not possibly be used to establish a strong church because their humanity is not mature.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Likewise, if there were only divinity but not humanity, there would be no possibility of establishing a strong church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Divinity is supported by humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Hence, there must be a strong humanity in order for the church to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The church is wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>As saved ones, we have God within and the flesh without.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>However, the boards of the tabernacle show that the divinity, gold, was on the outside, and that humanity, acacia wood, was on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Divinity was supported by humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The standing part was the acacia wood, and the expressed part was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>At the time of the Reformation, Luther was standing, but he expressed gold.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He was expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This is the principle of wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Whether the church is strong or weak has a great deal to do with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, we should not think that the church will be strong once we have some biblical knowledge and are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Strong humanity produces a strong church.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The picture regarding the boards of the tabernacle shows that the church is able to stand because of the solid base of redemption and strong humanity.</S>
