   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WITH REGARD TO IDOLS AND MILITIAS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To the brother in the Lord, Mr. Kuang Hsiung:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After leaving Shanghai, I have often thought about the grace the Third Overcomer Conference gave us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We hope that our work increases in light and in a deeper obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are twelve places with meetings in the P'ing Yang region of Chekiang province.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are twenty-one localities in Tai Shun and five in the Fu Ting region of Fukien province.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In my prayer over the past few years, I have had the hope of taking a trip through Tai Shun.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I had the opportunity to do so in March of this year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On March 17 I arrived in Ya Yang Hu Wei in Tai Shun and stayed there for four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I held a conference for five days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Lai Kun Ho translated for me because I spoke a different dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also had a meeting concerning the needs of the work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Huang Lu Ch'uan also attended the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not have time to write an article about the condition of the work and its results.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Lord is willing, in the near future I will do my best to write something and to fellowship about the gifts from the Lord and how they edify and render help for people concerning their gifts from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a question now concerning the Lord's table and the sin of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I have answered it well, please publish my answer in Collection of Newsletters with a note so that people can be helped even more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The idols are very strong in the locality where I am presently.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord bless all those in Him to be victorious through Him and to glorify His name!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Enclosed please find the questions and answers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Wang Yu T'ing</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>April 27</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Question:A believer has a common inheritance with an unbeliever in an idol temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the year of temple duty falls on that believer, is it all right for him to stay home and prepare the feast for the others, even if he does not worship the idols?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Answer:No. If the believer does this he has touched the sin of worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The source of the feast is the feast of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a matter of worshipping idols, and believers should flee from it 1 Cor 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believers and unbelievers should not be dissimilarly yoked 2 Cor 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must come out from their midst v. 17 . This is what the Almighty Lord has said.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Question:A believer and unbelievers have a common inheritance with the family grave in it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the year that the unbelievers take care of the grave, they sacrifice to the demons, and the believers attend their feast.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the year that the believers care for the grave, they do not sacrifice to the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The unbelievers take care of the sacrifice themselves, while the believers prepare the feast for them at home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What do you think of this arrangement?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Answer:If the believers do this, they have also committed the sin of worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible has very clear teachings about this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible completely separates the table of demons and the table of men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it is a table of demons 1 Cor 10:14-22 , whatever is on the table, even if it has not been sacrificed to the demons, becomes part of the demonic feast once it is placed on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A table of men, like the table at a banquet or a wedding feast, may have food that has been sacrificed to idols, yet it is still part of the banquet or wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not part of a demonic feast, and there is no sin of idolatry involved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we can partake of it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With regard to whether or not a believer should prepare a feast in conjunction with rituals at the family grave or participate in the cup of such a feast, the most important point he must ask himself is whether or not this feast of the grave ritual is a demonic feast!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the source is a demonic feast, we are eating and drinking of the table of demons, and what we prepare is also a demonic feast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do this, we will incur the Lord's wrath and cannot drink the cup of the Lord v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Question:If a brother has a large common inheritance containing many graves that require sacrifices, what should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Answer:If the brother is to take his rightful share, the parties involved must agree: 1 to give the brother his share separately; 2 that when it is the brother's turn to care for the graves, he does not sacrifice anything, nor does he spread a demonic feast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they are willing to let these matters rest, then the brother can take his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he cannot avoid sacrificing to demons or preparing a demonic feast, he should choose rather to give it up even if the inheritance is the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Incidentally, trying to settle the matter in court is also a damage to the Lord's glory.</S>
