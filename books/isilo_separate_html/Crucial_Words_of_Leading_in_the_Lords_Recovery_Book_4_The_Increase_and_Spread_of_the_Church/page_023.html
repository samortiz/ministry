<p>In a small group we particularly need to avoid pleasures and celebrations. <em>Pleasures</em> is not a good word. James 4:3 says, &ldquo;You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.&rdquo; When the saints come to the small group gathering in our home, it is normal for our heart to be full of joy. In order to express our love, it is easy to serve delicacies and to eat lavishly, but this can easily offend the Lord. If food is served, it should be simple, even simpler than what we normally eat at home. The emphasis of a love feast should be on fellowship, not on eating and drinking. Furthermore, the food should be prepared in a simple, clean, refreshing, and hygienic manner so that people do not become sick.</p>
<p>We must do our best to avoid worldliness, including celebrations, in the small groups. After meeting with a small group for a long time, we will know everyone quite well, and it will be easy to consider the celebration of birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries, including the giving of gifts. Our love for one another, however, is not manifested through celebrations and the giving of gifts. Our love is in the spirit, in reality. If we see one of our brothers and sisters in need, however, it would be good if we could help provide for their needs as a group through fellowship. This would please the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding Socializing</h2>
<p>We should not engage in vain talk or have personal affection toward some in our small group gathering. When people gather together and meet for the first time, they cannot help but converse with one another. However, it is easy for our preferences and emotions to direct our conversation. Although this is difficult to avoid, we should exercise to treat everyone equally. We must love not only those who are meek and considerate but also those who have a bad temper. God sends rain on the just and the unjust, and He even loves His enemy (Matt. 5:45-48). Therefore, we must avoid personal affection. Although I have coordinated with some brothers for decades, and we honestly love each other, we do not have personal affection for one another. It is easy for personal consideration to lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>Since those in a small group have much contact with one another, it is inevitable that the saints will become close. If we do not exercise to avoid worldliness and socializing, we will eventually begin to gossip about others and create many problems when we come to each other&rsquo;s homes. In order to prevent this from happening, we should not allow worldliness and socializing to creep into the gatherings. Our fellowship, love, and care for one another should be in Christ and in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Small Part of a Local Church,<br />
Not an Independent Entity</h2>
<p>The small group is not the church; it is only a small part of the church in a locality. It is not an independent entity. A small group is under the leading of the elders in the church. No matter how many small groups there are in a locality, all are under the leading of the elders because only this keeps the oneness of the Body of Christ in that locality. Any other consideration will produce divisions.</p>
<p>We should never have the thought of producing or building up something that is independent. Once something independent is produced, it will become a sect. We need to learn to be fully open to every small group in a church. Every small group must be open to every other small group, welcoming and embracing the brothers and sisters in the other groups. No one should be treated as an outsider, and no one should be excluded. Furthermore, we do not need to compare our group to other groups or to compete with other groups. We have to avoid this corrupt practice.</p>
<p>If someone is weak and tells you that he does not like his particular small group because a brother in his group is harsh, you should not try to solve his problem by suggesting that he come to your gathering because the brothers in your group are not harsh. You should not do such a thing. Even if the brothers in his small group are like tigers, you should help him go back to his small group. In a small group gathering, we should not try to draw people to us or give the impression that we are competing with others; this is the proper, normal condition of a small group gathering.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
