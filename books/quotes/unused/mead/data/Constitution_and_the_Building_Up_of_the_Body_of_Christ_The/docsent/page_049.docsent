   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TRANSFORMATION A. Not Merely an Outward Change</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation is not merely an outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I came to the United States in 1962, I began to stress in my messages the truth concerning the human spirit for us to contact God and to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second thing I stressed was the all-inclusive Christ with the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third thing I stressed was transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 the King James Version uses the word changed instead of the word transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this is an inadequate translation, because the Greek word here means transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to see that transformation is not a mere outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to explain what transformation is, let us consider the example of a healthy person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The healthy color in this person's face is not from applying cosmetics to his skin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The application of cosmetics is a mere outward change by outward makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way to have a healthy appearance is by eating healthy food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The healthy food metabolically makes us healthy, giving us a healthy appearance outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to grow in life and have the transformation in life, we need to eat Christ as our healthy, spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we eat, digest, and assimilate Christ as our spiritual food, the essence of this food gets into our being and produces transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians today are weak because they do not eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we eat Jesus every day, we will be spiritually energetic and will be transformed in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. An Inward Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>in Nature and Essence</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Transformation is not merely an outward change, but an inward transformation in nature and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is an inward, metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For us to have a metabolic change we need a new element added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the new element replaces the discharged old element, and we have an inward, metabolic change in nature and in essence.</S>
