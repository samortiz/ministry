   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second step in God s project was the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After He lived as Emmanuel on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the meaning of crucifixion?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most people would say that He was crucified on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is true, but we must realize that crucifixion not only means the taking away of sins, but also the termination of everything!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Incarnation means mingling, and crucifixion means termination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He was crucified on the cross, all the negative things were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even we were terminated there!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you know when and where you were terminated?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were all terminated on the cross with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was crucified, we were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the negative things were terminated on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have a bad temper, don t be bothered by that.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tell all the demons that your temper was terminated on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world was terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sin was terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The devil with all his fallen angels and demons were terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our flesh, our self, our fallen nature, our soul, our old man, our everything was terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our husband, our wife, our children, our brother, our sister were all terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything of the old creation was terminated on the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Crucifixion means termination, and termination means the end. This is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has taken a third step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Following crucifixion, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ was crucified and buried, but He rose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Around Him there was nothing but death, but death could not hold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was not captured by death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He took a tour to see death, to visit it for a while, but He walked out of death!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He walked in, and He walked out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That was resurrection, and resurrection means germination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First we were terminated, then we were germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Termination ends the old creation, and germination starts the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of us love our wife; but if we would let our wife be terminated on the cross, she would be germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we would have a new wife in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The same is true regarding the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am sure that all the sisters would rather have their husband in the new creation than in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are terminated, and then they are germinated with a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Crucifixion means termination, and resurrection means germination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fourth step is ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ascension means inauguration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever a new president of this country is elected, there is the need of an inauguration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before the inauguration he is the president-elect, but by his inauguration he becomes the official president.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same is true of the ascension of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By ascending to the heavens, He was inaugurated into His post as Lord of all Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God Himself has always been Lord of all, but by the ascension of Jesus, a man became the Lord of all!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you realize that the little Nazarene, Jesus, is now Lord of all?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was not simply put into the lead, but He was inaugurated into the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the time of His ascension, God prepared the whole universe for Jesus of Nazareth to become Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is also the Christ, as well as the King of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords Rev 19:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the Head of all things Eph 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What an inauguration He had!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the president of this country is inaugurated, thousands of people parade through Washington D. C. I do not know how many angels were parading when Jesus of Nazareth was inaugurated in the presence of God to be the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was made the Lord of lords and the Head of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the meaning of the fourth step, the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then, after His inauguration, He descended to baptize His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the fifth step.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the day of Pentecost He collected together all the Jewish members of His Body and put them into Himself who is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Later, in the house of Cornelius, He collected all the Gentile members of His Body and put them into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By this step of baptism, He baptized both Jews and Gentiles into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When were you baptized by the Spirit into the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you are a Jew, you were baptized at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you are a Gentile, you were baptized at the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even before we were born, we were all baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We were all terminated on the cross before we were born, and we were all baptized into one Body before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord Jesus Christ accomplished one crucifixion, one resurrection, and one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free: and were all made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have all been baptized already.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We were chosen before the foundation of the world, and at Christ s ascension, God gave all of us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In fact, at the ascension, God gave Christ four main things: His people, His life, His Spirit, and all the functions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then on the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius Christ put all of God s chosen people into Himself to make them His members.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This was all accomplished once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>INDWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After this, we have the indwelling, which is the sixth step.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After He put us all into Himself, then He came into us to indwell us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All the other steps which we have mentioned incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension and baptism were accomplished once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But the indwelling is not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>From the day that Christ came into us and began to indwell us, there are many things that must be done.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is why we need at least 20 messages to cover this matter of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>ADVENT</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After the indwelling, there will be the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the advent, which is also once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>So altogether we can see seven steps: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, baptism, indwelling, and the advent.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Incarnation means mingling, crucifixion means termination, resurrection means germination, ascension means inauguration, baptism means being put into the Triune God Matt 28:19, in in Greek is into , indwelling means transformation, and advent means transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the Lord comes back, He will transfigure our outward body like unto His glorious body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>At this time, from within and without, we will all be absolutely the same as He is 1 John 3:2 , we will be fully one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>These are the seven steps which God has taken to accomplish His purpose.</S>
