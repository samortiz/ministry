   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT TRANSFORMATION FOR GOD S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is clearly revealed in the Bible that God s intention is to work Himself into man so that He can be man s life and that man may be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was for this very purpose that God created man in His own image; man thus had the possibility of expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man was also created with a spirit; this was so that he might be able to receive God the Spirit into him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we know, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then God came in the Son as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of His human living, He went to the cross and died there for man s sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through that death He also destroyed Satan and terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After three days in the tomb, He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He was resurrected, He brought humanity into divinity, thus uplifting fallen humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This uplifted humanity is now in Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this same time He became the life-giving Spirit, able and ready to enter whoever believes in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever and wherever a person believes in the Lord Jesus, this life-giving Spirit comes into him and regenerates his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine Spirit then indwells that believer s spirit and becomes one with it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is saved, redeemed, regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He possesses God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is joined to the Lord and is one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now all he needs to do is to live Christ, to live one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD REPLACED</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When man fell, he lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because he had fallen away from God, certain things came in to replace God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually in the fallen man God was replaced by the following things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Knowledge of Good and Evil</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The knowledge of good and evil came in. Man began to know the difference between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He tried to do the good and forsake the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether he could succeed was another matter, but he did gain this knowledge and attempt to choose the good and reject the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Culture</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Culture is a development of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can say there are many different cultures, like Egyptian, Babylonian, Jewish, Greek, Roman, European, American, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nonetheless, all these cultures promote the good and denounce the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Human beings of every race and culture like to do good and turn away from evil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what their culture teaches them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Philosophy</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Philosophy is a further development of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a higher stage, but its principle is the same as that of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It extols good and condemns evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ethics</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ethics promote morality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among the various ethical teachings man has produced, those of Confucius rank the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ethics encourage man to live according to certain principles of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These principles are also based upon the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Religion</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Religion is superior to ethics and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is higher than culture and the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It surpasses these others because it brings in God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Religion looks to God for help.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Religion promotes the worship of God and asks His help in doing good and forsaking evil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet it has not forsaken philosophy nor rejected culture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It has rather adopted the positive aspects of culture and incorporated ethical teachings into its structure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These five things the knowledge of good and evil, culture, philosophy, ethics, and religion are the controlling factors of fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Wherever we may have been born and raised, we have been educated along the lines of these five things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether we are from the West or from the East, whether we are from one race or another, we have been taught from childhood the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our cultural backgrounds may seem quite different from others , but the differences are only superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have all been taught, for example, to honor our parents, to be honest, and to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is our common cultural heritage, though we may have learned it in Europe, in Asia, or in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The same is true of philosophy and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though they may have arisen in widely separated parts of the world, in essence all the philosophies and ethical teachings are concerned with promoting the good and rejecting the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As for religion, there are only three major ones: Judaism, Islam, and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Islam, the Moslem religion, is closely related to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In fact, the Koran, the Moslem bible, has many parts very similar to the Old Testament and to some of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Christianity Catholicism has developed as a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Judaism, Islam, and Catholicism all had their origins in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They worship the same God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In India there is Buddhism, but we do not call that a religion because the Buddha is not a god.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Chinese follow mainly the ethical teachings of Confucius, which is not a religion either.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All religion utilizes God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It looks to God to help promote and uplift culture, to improve people s knowledge of good and evil, to strengthen their philosophy, and to enable them to live by their ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the situation in which we were born and raised.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have been taught to live by the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We act according to our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are influenced by philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We try to follow ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are governed and directed by our religious upbringing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before you were saved, your behavior was probably loose and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once you were saved, you repented and regretted your past.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You tried not to do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You asked God to help you not to sin nor to offend others, but to strengthen you to live in a morally upright way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You wanted always to walk in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The result of our background and then of our Christian experience is that we have become people living a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The way we live is to do good, to try to walk in the presence of God, and to glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Dear saints, this is the wrong way to live!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is Satan s subtle deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not God s intention for us to live an upright life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He does not want us to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>His intention for us is neither to be good nor to be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Both good and bad are out of His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What, then, is God s intention?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is that He come into us and become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He becomes one with us and makes us one with Him that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We are to live God, not good!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is not after good men but God-men!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God wants to be our life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He wants us to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He is not satisfied to have us merely express what is good; nor does He want us to express what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are to express simply God Himself: this is His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This very God, in order to accomplish His intention, became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He went through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Through incarnation He entered into man; through resurrection He brought man into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Now He is in us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must no longer live according to the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We are not to follow the dictates of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Philosophy is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Ethical teachings we must disregard.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Religion is not for us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We no longer have any need of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In their place we have the very Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When we turn from these other things in which we were raised and educated, we are left with only this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Religion, ethics, philosophy, culture, the knowledge of good and evil all are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Only the living God is left.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We know Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He is the Spirit, indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Rather than practicing the presence of God, we practice being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When we live, He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When He lives, we live.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We and He are one.</S>
