<p>If we are clear concerning the condition of Christianity, we will know the attitude that we should have before men when we touch the matter of the church. Our service is focused on positive things, not on negative things. We disapprove of the deformed matters in Christianity, but our service is not focused on opposing these matters. Our ministry is not to criticize and attack others&rsquo; mistakes. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in raising us up. We were raised up by the Lord to give people proper things. The Lord did not send us to do a negative work but to do a positive work. The negative conditions that we have mentioned serve as a background that provides a contrast for the positive things. The examples that we have given are not meant to attack or oppose others. We do not want to argue with others but to firmly hold on to the light that we have received. It is useless to argue.</p>
<p>Instead of arguing with others concerning negative things, we should supply them with the positive things. When people see the proper condition, they will recognize the negative things. If such ones stubbornly remain in an erroneous condition, they will be accountable to the Lord. The condition in Christianity is one of confusion; thus, we cannot take care of too many things. We can only present the truth with the hope that all erroneous and disorderly things will be corrected and restored. Our ministry is not to criticize, attack, or oppose.</p>
<p>In our service we should stand in a proper position and do things with a proper attitude. All the matters related to our service should have a scriptural expression without and a spiritual reality within. We should serve the Lord according to the truth in the Scriptures and in the reality of the Spirit. We should not have or do anything that is not according to the Scriptures or the initial church. We do not need to criticize or oppose those who want to keep other practices, because our ministry is not for criticizing and opposing others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should have an attitude that does not fear criticism or opposition. Our attitude should be to care only for the burden that God has given us. As long as our practices are of the Lord, we should not be concerned about whether we are approved or opposed by others. Our practice should not be influenced by others; rather, it should be directed by God. Our heart must be turned only to God, and our eyes must look only at Him. We should please only God and not be concerned with whether others like us or hate us.</p>
<p>We should not criticize others, and we should not fear their criticism. With a pure conscience, according to the light of the Bible and by the leading of the Spirit, we should practice what God has commissioned us to do. What others do and how they treat us are not our concern. This is the proper attitude that we should have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>We need to have a proper attitude before men and also before God. We should be clear concerning the condition in Christianity, and we should be clear concerning God&rsquo;s purpose in raising us up. Moreover, we should have a balanced, proper attitude before men and a proper attitude toward God.</p>
<p>We need to be right not only in our attitude before men but also in our attitude before God. We must not be quick to detest and condemn the various conditions in Christianity. Rather, we should ask God to enlarge our capacity so that our heart matches His heart. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, we want to serve by You, not by ourselves. You raised us up to serve You. If our service is profitable for the gospel or for the testimony of Your Son, we pray that You would bless it. If our service causes the gospel to suffer loss or annuls the testimony of Your Son, stretch out Your hand to stop our service and take away Your blessing. Our service is not for our sake but for Your sake.&rdquo; Such a strong declaration should not only be the basis of our attitude toward God; it should also be the basis of our negotiating with Him. If our standing, intention, and attitude are right, He will accept our declaration.</p>
<p>We need to declare our attitude before God in strong and serious prayer. This is not an ordinary kind of prayer; it is a pleading, a negotiating. Negotiation requires a proper position. We must be for God before we can utter such a prayer. We must be those who are raised up and sent by God, and we must not do things according to our desire. Unless we are such ones, we cannot utter such a prayer, and if we cannot utter such a prayer, our service is questionable.</p>
<p>We must be able to say that it is not our desire to do things in a particular way, to dispute with Christians, or to set up our own group. Rather, the Spirit of God in His grace has visited and burdened us; hence, we must rise up to serve Him. This is not for our own preference or pleasure; this is the issue of God&rsquo;s revelation, and it is His commission. Therefore, we can boldly say, &ldquo;O God, You know that doing these things, walking this way, and serving You do not come from us. This is Your business, not ours; it is Your responsibility, not ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should also declare that we agree with any work that is profitable for the church and God&rsquo;s testimony, and we should ask God to bless this work. If our declaration is on the right ground, God will stretch forth His hand, and many problems will be solved. It is useless to debate. We must stand on the right ground and declare our attitude toward God. Then God will vindicate those who are standing with Him and serving as His oracle on the earth.</p>
<p>We should declare our attitude before God without any ambiguity. God delights in having people on earth who stand with Him. We should tell Him that we want what He wants and that we reject what He rejects. We should declare to Him that this is our attitude.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
