When they went through one village, neither of them rode on the donkey. Some people in that village criticized them by saying, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t one of them ride on the donkey?&#8221; Then the father told the son to ride on the donkey. When they passed through the second village, somebody criticized them by saying, &#8220;This little boy is no good. His father is so old, but he rides and his father walks.&#8221; When they heard this criticism, the father decided to ride on the donkey. Then they passed through the third village, and some there criticized the father for riding on the donkey and making his son walk. Eventually, due to all this criticism, they got rid of the donkey. That meant they got rid of the item for people to criticize. All such criticisms are opinions. We have to admit that we are absolutely like this. If I did not have the mercy based upon what the Lord has been teaching me through the years, my opinions might be much more than yours.<p>All the guests who stay in others&#8217; homes have opinions about the way things are there. I have learned the lesson by the Lord&#8217;s mercy that when I am someone&#8217;s guest, I would go only to the place which my host assigned to me. I would eat whatever is set before me without any opinion. Could you learn not to express any opinion in any kind of situation? If you learn this lesson, you will be useful in the Lord&#8217;s hand.<p>Both opinions and oldness are big enemies to us. For us to be useful in the Lord&#8217;s hand we must deal with these things. I have been reading the Bible for many years, and I have expounded the entire New Testament. But whenever I come to a portion of the Word, I do not consider that I know that much, because I want to see more. If I could have another series of Life-studies on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, these Life-studies would be new and different. Our understanding of the Word should not be set or settled. We must always keep ourselves so young, new, and fresh with a learning and open spirit when we come to the Bible.<p>The technology in the world is always improving, but much of the time we remain the same in the Lord&#8217;s work. If we stay in our oldness, the Lord cannot move on. We must learn these two things-never to be old and not to have any opinion. I assure you that if you would not be old, revelation will come to you every day. Oldness covers your view and causes you to be opaque. It covers your inner eyes to prevent you from seeing something new of the Lord. The trouble with today&#8217;s Christianity is oldness. They say they keep the truth, but actually they are keeping their oldness. They would not have any kind of adjustment according to the revelation of the Bible. Peter and Apollos both remained in their oldness. To remain in their oldness was for them to be natural.<p>Your oldness will kill you, and your opinion will bury you. Look at the real situation. Out of one hundred, it is difficult to find five who are not old and who are without opinion. In this training you have to practice what I have told you. First, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function. Then we saw that oldness is versus revelation and opinion is versus obedience. If you are an opinionated person, you cannot obey anyone.<p>This is not a message to stir you up. This is a message that would put you down in your oldness and in your opinion. These two things are the prominent troubles in the book of Acts. While the Lord was going on in His move with Peter, the Lord encountered trouble. The Lord wanted to go on from the Jews to the Gentiles, to the ones who were unclean in the eyes of the Jews. He wanted Peter to contact them. For Peter to eat the unclean things was for him to contact the Gentiles, but Peter had his old concept.<p>The apostle Paul, however, was bold to go to the Gentiles. He did not just eat with them but he went to the Gentiles, city after city, to set up churches among them. He took the vision and dropped the oldness. He was altogether new. Before he met the Lord on the road to Damascus, he was very stubborn, but his revelation caused him to drop his oldness.<p>Paul was more stubborn than Peter, but Peter did not drop his oldness thoroughly and absolutely. We know this because of what Paul told us in Galatians 2. Peter shrank back from eating with the Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision (vv. 11-13). This shows that Peter was not absolute. Although Paul was younger than Peter, he rebuked Peter to his face for his hypocrisy.<p>It is hard to see any signs in the New Testament that Paul was opinionated. Yet we see two persons related to him who were very opinionated-Barnabas and Apollos. On the one hand, he had trouble with Barnabas&#8217;s opinion; on the other hand, he had trouble with Apollos&#8217;s opinion. So these two dear brothers were through with working together with Paul. Aquila was different. Timothy was also different. When Paul asked Timothy to remain somewhere, he remained (1 Tim. 1:3). When Paul asked Timothy to come to him, he came (2 Tim. 4:21a). Apollos was a good brother who knew the Bible, but when Paul urged him to go to Corinth, he would not go. He did not want to go at Paul&#8217;s desire, but at his desire. Today in the ministry we have the same trouble.<p>The full-time training is to train you to take the regulations. That means that you are being trained to drop the oldness and you are learning not to have any opinions. You have to get out of your oldness. Also, as long as the church and the ministry are going on toward the main goal, you have to forget your opinions.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>An Opening Word to the Full-Time Trainees Concerning Regulations and Opinions &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
