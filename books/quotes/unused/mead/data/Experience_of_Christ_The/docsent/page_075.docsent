   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have pointed out, the first thing the Lord Jesus did when He came out to minister was to be buried by John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that He exercised His will to terminate His natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When John the Baptist wanted to hinder Him from being baptized, the Lord seemed to say, "No, I must be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must put Me into the water."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By being baptized by John, the Lord indicated that He was willing to put away His human life and to keep it always under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, in the four Gospels we see a crucified and resurrected life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To repeat, the Lord was crucified and resurrected, not only at the end of the four Gospels, but at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually the time came for the Lord to be crucified physically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, after this consummate death there was the ultimate resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, wherever death is, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How much the power of resurrection can be manifested in us depends upon how much death we enter into.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not get into death at all, there will be no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have a little experience of death, a little of the power of resurrection will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The basic principle is this: the more death, the more resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Philippians 3 Paul wanted to gain Christ and be found in Him in a condition of not having his own righteousness, but of living out God as his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection by putting himself aside and living under the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The result of living under Christ's death is knowing the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE POWER OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult to say what the power of resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Speaking of Christ, Paul says in Romans 1:4 that He was "designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul says that Christ was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that power is according to the Spirit out of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that the power of resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit is the reality of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a previous message we pointed out that the Spirit is what remains after we set ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If unbelievers set themselves aside, nothing will remain, for they do not have the Spirit as the remainder in them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we put ourselves aside, we have the Spirit as the remainder within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is set aside is the self, and what remains is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a brother will set himself aside when his wife is arguing with him, the Spirit will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to do only one thing always put ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To do this is to put the self under death and to keep it on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we do this, we live a crucified life and have a base for the power of resurrection to be manifested.</S>
