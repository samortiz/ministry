   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RAPTURE OF THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 12:5 continues, "And her child was caught up to God and to His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Caught up" in this verse differs in meaning from "caught up" as it is used in 1 Thessalonians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There it says that some will be caught up in the clouds, while here it says that the man-child was caught up to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The man-child was caught up to the throne because someone is already on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Head of the church is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's purpose is not just to have one man upon the throne, but many men upon the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His original desire was to have a group of men on the throne to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God desires that Christ and the church together bring His purpose to fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the majority of the people in the church at that time will still not be able to attain the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only a minority, called the overcomers, can go to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They will be caught up to His throne because they will achieve God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two things occur immediately after the man-child is caught up: "And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And the dragon warred and his angels" Rev 12:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Notice the word "and," which is used twice immediately after the man-child was caught up in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 6 says, "And the woman fled into the wilderness..."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then verse 7 says, "And there was war in heaven..."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fleeing of the woman into the wilderness and the warfare in heaven are both due to the man-child being caught up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us look into the matter of warfare in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First there is Michael, whose name is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Michael means "Who is like God?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an excellent question.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan's intention is to be like God, but Michael asks, "Who is like God?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only does Satan desire to be like God, but he also tempted man to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Michael's question, "Who is like God?", shakes the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems as if Michael is telling Satan, "You want to be like God, but you will never make it!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what Michael's name reveals to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Immediately after the man-child is caught up, there is war in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, the cause of the war in heaven is the rapture of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we see that the rapture of the man-child is not just a matter of some individuals being caught up, but more than that, it is to bring to an end the warfare which has been going on for ages and generations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The old serpent, the enemy of God, has been fighting against God for several thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When this warfare takes place in heaven, Michael and his angels fight against the dragon, who is the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Formerly he was a serpent, but now he has changed in form to a dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has steadily increased his power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, once the man-child is caught up, not only is the dragon unable to be enlarged any further, but he is cast down from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The rapture of the man-child is a transaction which causes Satan to have no more position in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the result of the fight between Michael and his angels and the dragon and his angels?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 8 and 9 say, "And they the dragon and his angels did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dragon's defeat is the outcome of this battle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was no place for him in heaven; he and his angels were all cast down to the earth.</S>
