<P>Verses 31-32:"Which of the two did the will of the father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him." "The way of righteousness" here means the way of peace. Although John encouraged them once, and the faith of the tax collectors and harlots encouraged them once again, they still would not believe. "The kingdom of God." Why not say "the kingdom of the heavens"? If "the kingdom of the heavens" had been used, the real significance would be lost here. The kingdom of God mentioned here refers to the spiritual reality. Without regeneration one cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5). "Before you." This is a Greek expression; it does not mean that the Pharisees would eventually enter the kingdom of God after the tax collectors. Rather, it means that the tax collectors would enter while these Pharisees would not.</P><P>Verses 33-40:"Hear another parable. There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad. And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit. And the vinedressers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent some other slaves, more than the first, and they did likewise to them. Then later he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son. But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance. And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?" This parable is concerning "a man, a householder." Hence, it cannot be interpreted on the human level, because (1) God never goes away to a foreign country, and (2) God foreknew that the Jews would kill the Lord. The householder refers to God. The vineyard signifies the realm of Israel. The hedge signifies protection (Job 1:10). "Winepress." Wine refers to that which makes man happy. The tower is a watchtower, by which one acquires knowledge. "Leased it out." It is not for sale, and it is absolutely not given away. To lease it out means that God has the ownership and that He asked the Jews only to manage it for Him. If interpreted on the human level, the fact that He "went abroad" is unexplainable. "And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near." This shows the earnestness of God's desire. Before the Lord came, God already had such a desire. The "slaves" signify the prophets who came before the Lord, who were all persecuted and even killed. "His son" refers to the Lord Jesus. "They will respect my son." This was spoken according to human logic. As far as God is concerned, the Lord did not stumble into death at the hands of fate; instead, He came purposely to die, to humble Himself, and to take the form of a slave. "This is the heir." Again this is true only as far as the human aspect of the parable is concerned, because the scribes and the Pharisees basically denied Him as the heir. The vinedressers signify the Pharisees, the scribes, the chief priests, etc.</P><P>Verse 41:"They said to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons." They drew this conclusion by themselves. This was fulfilled at the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. However, only a part was fulfilled; the major part will be fulfilled during the great tribulation. They said, "His blood be upon us [A.D. 70] and upon our children [the great tribulation]!" (Matt. 27:25). The "other vinedressers" (v. 41) are the Jews in the kingdom and not the Jews at the present time.</P><P>Verse 42:"Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, `The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" "The builders" signify the scribes, the Pharisees, and the chief priests. "The stone...the head of the corner" signifies the Lord Jesus (see Psa. 118:22-23; Acts 4:11). "Marvelous." The Jews, who have a blood relationship with the Lord, do not believe, yet we, the Gentiles, believe. The cornerstone also refers to resurrection. "Have you never read?" They could ask themselves.</P><P>Verse 43:"Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit." The kingdom of God here refers to the spiritual reality. One can take away only another's spiritual experience.</P><P>Verse 44:"And he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff." To the Jews the Lord was the rock of stumbling. The Jews were stumbled because the Lord was not splendorous and did not have a kingly demeanor (see Isa. 8:14-15; Rom. 9:32-33; 1 Cor. 1:23; 1 Pet. 2:8). To the church the Lord is the rock and the cornerstone (1 Cor. 3:11; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). To the Gentiles the Lord is the smiting stone (Dan. 2:34). The first part of verse 44 refers to the Jews, and the second part refers to the Gentiles. Concerning the Gentiles they must wait for the coming of the kingdom (Dan. 2:44). Today the Jews say that He is the carpenter's son, a deceiver, and they are stumbled.</P><P>Verses 45-46:"And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking concerning them. And though they sought to seize Him, they feared the crowds because they held Him as a prophet." Unbelievers are fearful of everything. Christians are bold; they are not afraid of being despised and ridiculed. Fearful people dare not believe in the Lord; they reap for themselves eternal perdition.</P>
