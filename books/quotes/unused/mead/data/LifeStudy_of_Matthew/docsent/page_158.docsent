   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDUCED AND MADE SOLID</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many saints in the Lord s recovery can testify that they are not merely wheat, but something more solid, valuable, and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before certain brothers and sisters came to the Lord s recovery, they were wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outwardly, they were rather bulky and showy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But during the years they have been in the recovery, they have been constricted and reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have become smaller year by year.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you were bulky, you were soft and light like cotton, easily ruined by a little water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But after you are reduced, constricted, and transformed, you have the assurance that you are more precious to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of us can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We in the Lord s recovery are not as bulky as we used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, we are constantly being reduced, transformed, and made more solid.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After you have become as solid as a precious stone, not even a flood can damage you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of damaging a precious stone, water only makes it more clean and valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we examine Christian history, we shall find those who belong in the categories of the treasure and the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The parables of the treasure and the pearl refer to the overcomers throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As an illustration of the genuine believers, the Lord uses the example of wheat grown from seed sown in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This, however, is a general illustration of the genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord uses other illustrations to describe the overcoming members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They used to be lifeless grains of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But they wounded Christ, the oyster living in the death water, and stayed at Christ s wound, where they participated in the secretion of Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This not only enabled them to be regenerated, but also caused them to become pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is more than a seed sown in a field to produce wheat; it is something that has become precious through the secretion of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have pointed out that the treasure no doubt refers to precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church life and the kingdom life, for in this city the church life is combined with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The building of New Jerusalem is mainly of the pearl gates and the precious stones which form the wall and its foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All this is set upon a golden base that upholds the entire building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message we are focusing on the pearl gate and the treasure wall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The pearl refers to the church, and the treasure, to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church and the kingdom are spoken of in Matthew 13 in a mysterious way in parables.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in chapter sixteen the Lord speaks a clear word to His disciples regarding the church and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 16:18 He says, On this rock I will build My church, and in the following verse, I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these verses we see the church and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to understand the treasure and the pearl in Matthew 13, we must consider the church and the kingdom in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you pray over these two chapters, you will spontaneously see that the treasure is the kingdom and that the pearl is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both the treasure and the pearl are in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus sold whatever He had and bought the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Acts 20:28 says that the Lord purchased the church with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that on the cross He sold all He had and bought the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse is a strong proof that the pearl in Matthew 13 is the church, for the pearl was purchased by the merchant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No doubt the merchant is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE KINGDOM LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We enter the realm of the kingdom by being regenerated, by being born again John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regeneration is related to the pearl, for the pearl is produced by the principle of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By being reborn we enter into the sphere of God, into the realm of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we were regenerated, we began to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we loved Him, we wanted to stay under His control and be restricted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of us have experienced being restricted on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not limited by man, but by something inward that is invisible by the life under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may try to do certain things, but we are restricted from doing them by a mysterious, invisible, inward control.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our relatives or schoolmates are free to do those things, but we cannot do them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Something invisible exercises an inward control over us, and we live under this control.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the treasure, the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before we became Christians, we were sand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that something living has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As more life juice is secreted over us, we become precious and begin to live under a mysterious control.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the experience of the pearl and the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The local church in the Lord s recovery is a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in the eyes of the Lord, this church must also be a treasure hidden from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Neither the worldly people nor those in Christianity know what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But deep within we know that we are living a pearl life and a life under an invisible control.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are the pearl and the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first four parables of chapter thirteen do not fully cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not just the wheat or the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are more precious, solid, and genuine than this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are the pearl and the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the church life with the kingdom life in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we did not have the second group of parables, we would not know where we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am happy to say that I am no longer in the first group I am in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Can you say this?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Are you simply a believer who has a little of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If this is your situation, then you must be a genuine Christian in Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We thank the Lord that we are not in Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Praise Him that many of us are the pearl and the treasure in the Lord s recovery!</S>
