<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. COMPOSED OF GOD'S JUDICIAL REDEMPTION<br>AND HIS ORGANIC SALVATION</H2><P>Such a complete salvation of God is composed of God's judicial redemption and His organic salvation. God's judicial redemption is the procedure of God's complete salvation for the believers to participate in God's organic salvation as the purpose of God's complete salvation. The procedure is judicial, and the purpose is organic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God's Judicial Redemption</H2><P>God's judicial redemption, accomplished by the death of Christ (5:10a), includes the following items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God's Forgiveness of the Believers' Sins</H2><P>Forgiveness of sins (4:7) is based on the redemption of Christ, which was accomplished through His death (Acts 10:43; Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 15:3); it is the initial and basic blessing of God's full salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God's Justification of the Believers</H2><P>Justification (Rom. 3:24) is God's action whereby He approves people according to His standard of righteousness. God can do this on the basis of the redemption of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God's Reconciliation of the Believers to Himself</H2><P>Propitiation and forgiveness of sins are adequate for a sinner but not for an enemy. An enemy needs reconciliation (5:11), which includes propitiation and forgiveness but goes further, even to resolving the conflict between two parties. Our being reconciled to God is based on Christ's redemption and was accomplished through God's justification (Rom. 3:24; 2 Cor. 5:18-19). Reconciliation is the result of being justified out of faith.</P>
