Our need today is nothing other than the Triune God as the Spirit. The book of John stresses our need of the Spirit, who is the reality of the divine life. John also shows us the principle of life versus good or evil. If we desire to have a proper church life, we need to live and work according to the tree of life, not according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We will see something concerning this in chapter two. In chapter three we will fellowship concerning the two kinds of fruit out of the divine life. We need to walk by the Spirit to bear the fruit of Christian virtues so that we can be prevailing in the gospel to bear the fruit of saved persons regenerated with the divine life.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE SPIRIT BECOMING ONE WITH MAN</h2><p>The relationship between us and God is something that we cannot fully describe. According to Genesis 1:26, God created man in His own image. It is a great matter for us to be created in the very image of the Triune God. The Bible shows us that the intention of God in making us in His image is to make us one with Him. Man as the creation of God is to be made one with God. God&#8217;s desire was for humanity to be made one with divinity. Not many Christians realize that God&#8217;s intention is to make Himself one with us. When God makes us one with Him, He is making Himself one with us.<p>It is wonderful to have our sins forgiven and receive the redemption of Christ. It is wonderful to be regenerated with God, of God, and by God. But we must remember that God&#8217;s intention in redemption and regeneration is that we and He would be joined together as one. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; As believers in Christ, we are joined to the Lord and we are one spirit with Him. When you are living in your daily life, do you realize that you are one with God, that you are one spirit with the Lord? The Bible says that we were made according to the image of God, that we have been reborn of God (John 1:13; 3:3, 6), and that we are one spirit with the Lord.<p>Now we have to ask how we could be one spirit with the Lord. The Bible shows us that God as a whole is Spirit (John 4:24), and it also refers to the Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2; Rom. 8:9). In resurrection the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God (John 1:29) became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Furthermore, the third of the Trinity is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God, the life-giving Spirit, and the Holy Spirit are the one Spirit. We need the sixty-six books of the Bible to reveal the one Spirit to us. Eventually, in the book of Revelation, this one Spirit becomes the seven Spirits (4:5; 5:6). God&#8217;s intention to make Himself one with us could only be accomplished by His being a Spirit. If God were not a Spirit, there would be no way for Him to be one with us. God has to be a Spirit, and He is the Spirit. God became a man, and after He accomplished redemption on the cross as the Lamb of God, in His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. Then when He comes to us as the third of the Trinity, He is the Holy Spirit. By being such a Spirit, He is capable of being one with us.<p>After the Lord Jesus, the incarnated God, died on the cross and entered into His resurrection, He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). At that time He was the Spirit, and He breathed Himself into His disciples as the Spirit. It is so easy for the air to get into us and be one with us. Wherever we go on this earth, the air follows us and is even at our destination, waiting to meet us. If we do not breathe the air for even a short period of time, we can die. The Triune God is like the omnipresent air to us. He is a wonderful, divine person mingled with humanity as the divine air for us to breathe in and enjoy. We cannot understand Him to the uttermost, but we can experience Him all the time.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AS THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</h2><p>When a local church has been established and has existed for a number of years, it has a tendency to become old. Degradation comes from oldness. We have to find out why we become old. The reason that we become old is because we are short of the Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. Today we are receiving the Spirit of the Triune God who has gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Although we have such a Spirit, we are short of this Spirit. We may have much knowledge, terminology, and doctrines, but we are short of the Spirit. The reality of all the doctrines is the Spirit. The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality (John 14:17). If there were no Spirit, God would not be real. God is not real to us without the Spirit because the reality of God is the Spirit. The reality of Jesus Christ and the reality of the resurrection of Christ are the Spirit. Without the Spirit, even the eternal life, the life of God, is not real. The Spirit is the reality of the divine life.<p>The Spirit is also the reality of so many other items such as righteousness. Without the Spirit, there is no righteousness. Without the Spirit, there is also no real humility. One may seem to be very humble, but that is not humility in actuality. In actuality the Spirit is the reality of our humility. Love without the Spirit is a falsehood. Our natural love is a falsehood because it is a love with a motive for ourselves. As long as our love is not the Spirit, that love is not real. The New Testament shows us that the Spirit is the reality of all the positive things in the universe, including God, Christ, resurrection, the divine attributes, and even the proper human virtues. The reality of the positive things in the universe is uniquely the Spirit. You may be a professor, a doctor, or a president, but without the Spirit, you are simply a vanity. To be a real man, we must be filled with the Spirit. This is our urgent need.<p>We do not need what we are in our natural life. Whatever we are is a falsehood. We must not trust our humility or kindness. Whatever we are is not trustworthy. Romans 3:4 says, &#8220;Let God be true and every man a liar.&#8221; If one thinks he is true, he must consider himself to be God. In Mark 10 a young man came to the Lord Jesus and said, &#8220;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#8221; The Lord Jesus replied, &#8220;Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One-God&#8221; (vv. 17-18). To call one good means that you consider him to be God. If you say that you are true, you are blaspheming. Only God uniquely is true. We all are a falsehood. The reality, the real thing, is the Spirit.<p>The Spirit is all we need. Doctrines, terminologies, and points without the Spirit are condemned. Our &#8220;no&#8221; is condemned, and our &#8220;yes&#8221; is just as condemned. Evil is condemned, and good is likewise condemned. Genesis 2 speaks of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (v. 9b). The tree of evil is also the tree of good. Neither evil nor good is life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil brings us death (v. 17). Four things are related to this complicated tree: knowledge, good, evil, and death. Besides this tree there is the tree of life (v. 9a). It is purely and simply of life. There is no knowledge, good, or evil involved with it, so there is no death. The more knowledge you have, the more poison of death you have received. The more you talk about good and evil, yes or no, right or wrong, the more you have been poisoned with death. In so many years of service in the churches, I have rarely been to a church in which there is no talk about who is right and who is wrong. Wherever a serving one goes, some cases will be brought to him, and he will be asked to decide matters of &#8220;yes or no&#8221; and &#8220;right or wrong.&#8221; This is the poison of the serpent, which is the poison of death.<h2 class=head1>BREATHING IN THE SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h2><p>Our need is the Spirit. Christians always like to talk about revival. However, in the entire New Testament the word revival is not used. For many years I did not know the reason for this. However, today I realize that we do not need a revival; we need the Spirit. The Spirit is here today. If you are a person short of air, it is foolish to say you need a revival. The air is here. You simply need the proper breathing to take the air in. You even need some particular deep breathing several times a day. Those who are regenerated do not need a revival. The Spirit, who is life, is within us just like the air. We simply need to breathe Him in.<p>If we all drop everything else and take care of breathing the Spirit, we will be very healthy. Stop your gossiping with the saints and with your spouse. Simply pray. Do not pray for others, saying, &#8220;Lord, have mercy upon him that he might repent.&#8221; You do not need to pray in this way. You should rather pray for yourself: &#8220;Lord, shine over me and shine from within me.&#8221; After ten minutes of this kind of prayer, you will have a deep sensation that the Spirit is moving in you. You will be filled, not with knowledge but with the Spirit.<p>Many times we do not need to speak so much in prayer. Simply call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; If you would call on the name of the Lord for ten minutes without speaking anything else, you will experience the proper breathing. Speaking too much in prayer and mentioning too many things concerning others can terminate the proper breathing. The proper breathing is simply to call on the name of the Lord. You do not even need to confess your failures with so many words. The fewer words you use and the more calling you do, the better. While you are exchanging words with your spouse, you should change your arguing to calling &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; This will not only stop your arguing, but it will also cause you to be filled with the Spirit. To pray and be filled with the Spirit is all that we need.<h2 class=head1>OUR SHORTAGE OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>My burden is to point out our shortage. We are short of the Spirit. Today the saints in the churches may have too much knowledge, too much terminology, and too much discernment exercised toward others rather than toward themselves. This kills the churches and the saints and annuls the things of the divine life. Whether we are right or wrong, good or bad, does not matter. We are short of the Spirit.<p>We may hear many messages concerning Christ from the Word. But when we hear them, we may merely be infused with more terminology. After returning home from the meeting, one brother may say that the teaching was very good, but another brother may say it was not so good. One brother may uplift the speaker, while another brother may say that he cannot uplift him. This kind of talk is not healthy and enlivening. It is deadening. Today we all need the Spirit. We are short of the Spirit. This is why we may be in a pitiful situation of being critical and of condemning others. Some may say, &#8220;I am for this,&#8221; and others may say, &#8220;I am for that.&#8221; This is similar to what was being spoken by the saints in the church in Corinth, where each one said, &#8220;I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:12). This kind of talk is deadening and is a strong proof that we are short of the Spirit.<p>How much of the Spirit do we have today? We should not say that we experienced the Spirit many years ago. You may have drunk very much yesterday, but if you do not drink today and for the next three days, you may die. We may have been short of the living water of the Spirit for three months or more. Do not consider others. We must consider ourselves in this light. I like to keep myself filled with living water all the time. I like to be filled with the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit. I do not like to be full of knowledge. I hope that we all would say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, fill me. I hate the terminology. I hate gossiping. I hate murmurings, reasonings, and talk about others or even about myself. I hate all of this kind of talk. I want to be filled with You as the Spirit.&#8221;<p>Whether you uplift a minister of the Word or condemn him, whether you are for him or against him, you are still in the tree of knowledge. One may say, &#8220;I am for this person,&#8221; while another may say, &#8220;I will never be for him,&#8221; but both are altogether in the second tree, not in the tree of life. In 1 Corinthians 1:12 Paul condemned the one who said that he was of Christ as well as the one who said that he was of Paul. Paul might have said, &#8220;Do not say you are of Paul. Rather, I, Paul, am for you.&#8221; We must stop all deadening talk. This will be our rescue. Our deadening talk will be used by the subtle one, the old serpent, to spread his deadening poison. What we need is the Spirit.<p>Do not consider that you know anything. Paul said he planted and Apollos watered, but God made to grow (1 Cor. 3:6). The life-giver is the unique One. Instead of being the means through which God can give life to others, we can give death to others. We should stop our deadening talk, turn to the Lord, and call &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; We should forget about everything else and simply call upon the name of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>TAKING THE WAY OF THE CHURCH POSITIVELY AND AVOIDING NEGATIVE TALK</h2><p>We must first call upon the name of the Lord day after day. Then we must know nothing that we could talk about in a deadening way. Third, we must love one another. Do not love anyone with an impure motive. That is politics, and you will not be loving as a Christian but as a politician. Fourth, we should live Christ, walking in our spirit. We must not consider what is wrong or what is right. We should only know how to walk in our spirit. In our spirit is the Spirit. When we walk in the Spirit, He is walking with us, and we enjoy Christ and live Christ. Fifth, we should speak Christ to others, in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2). This is to present Christ to others. Today the entire human society is thirsty. Everyone is a needy one and is thirsty. To speak Christ to people and to live Christ will attract people. Finally, we should always come together with the saints to worship, to fellowship, and to speak Christ and minister Christ to others. If we do this, the churches will be flourishing.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery there are no heresies. There is no fundamental problem among us, and we do not have an organization. Forget about any rumors you may hear. Live a very simple life, loving the Lord, calling on Him, loving one another, walking in the Spirit, and preaching and speaking Christ to everyone you meet, in season and out of season. Then we should do our best to come to the meetings, either in the homes, in small groups, or in a big meeting. Then we will enjoy Him. What we are will be expressed, and this will quench the thirst of today&#8217;s society and meet the need of people today. Spontaneously, we will be the lampstand, and we will be able to attract others. People will be saved through us. Let us take this way positively.<p>All of the saints are lovable, and no one is worthy of being criticized, so we do not need to spend time on the negative things. Some are afraid we may go astray, but do not be anxious for tomorrow. None of us can live a life in tomorrow. In this sense, we do not have tomorrow. What we have is today. Be at peace and enjoy your life today.<p>From now on I hope there will be no more negative talk. Whenever you hear something negative, remind one another not to talk in this way. Say something positive, wonderful, and beautiful. Then we will see the churches flourish. In Romans 14:4, Paul said, &#8220;Who are you that judges another&#8217;s household servant? To his own lord he will stand or fall. But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.&#8221; We need to have this kind of spirit. Do not worry about others. Simply live today, always considering others more highly than yourself. Love everyone. Christians are a loving people; the Christian life is a life of love. Only love builds up (1 Cor. 8:1). Therefore, we should remind one another to avoid negative talk and keep ourselves filled with the Spirit all the time. Our urgent need is the Spirit of the Triune God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>NOT GOOD OR EVIL BUT LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 4:10-14, 20-21, 23-24; 8:3-9; 9:1-3; 11:20-27</h1><p>The book of John stresses our need of the Spirit, who is the reality of the divine life. In this chapter we will examine four cases in this Gospel that illustrate the principle of life versus good and evil. Within the fallen race of man there is always the question: &#8220;Is this good or evil, right or wrong, yes or no?&#8221; When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, people always brought questions concerning good and evil, right and wrong, and yes and no to Him.<h2 class=head1>THE WORSHIP OF GOD IN SPIRIT</h2><p>In John 4 is the case of a sinful woman despised by society. In her talk with the Lord, He pointed out to her that she needed the living water (v. 10). The living water is the Triune God, even the Son of God, the very Christ who became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This was all that the woman needed. When she asked Him for this water, Jesus said to her, &#8220;Go, call your husband and come here&#8221; (John 4:16). The Lord was wise and very gracious. He was not like us. Many times when we preach the gospel, we do not have much wisdom. When we preach the gospel of the Lord as the living water and the sinner replies that he wants it, we may say, &#8220;What about your sin? Don&#8217;t you know you are a sinner?&#8221; This may offend people, and this offense will cause them to be closed. The Lord Jesus was wise. He did not use the word sin; He used the word husband instead. It is as if He said, &#8220;Go call your husband. I do not want to talk to you about sin. I want to talk to you about your husband. You have a problem concerning your husband.&#8221; That woman was deeply touched. The matter of her husband was the real issue with her. This matter was the center of her sinfulness.<p>At this point the woman lied to the Lord Jesus by speaking the truth. She said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a husband&#8221; (v. 17). Whether this was a lie or the truth depends on your interpretation. The Lord did not condemn her but said, &#8220;You have well said, I don&#8217;t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly&#8221; (vv. 17-18). She did not confess her sins, but the Lord Jesus made a thorough confession of her sins for her. Then the woman became clever and turned the question concerning her husband to a religious question concerning the worship of God. She said, &#8220;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&#8221; (v. 20). Her question was related to whether one should worship in that mountain or in Jerusalem. It was a question of yes or no, right or wrong. The Lord Jesus did not answer yes or no, right or wrong. He said, &#8220;Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father....But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him&#8221; (vv. 21, 23).<p>Here we may see a principle. In that day among the Jews and Samaritans, there was much talk about the worship of God. This is a good, glorious, and beautiful subject. Today it is the same. In the churches we may have much talk about the worship of God. Some may talk about whether to worship God in this way or in that way, by this means or by that means, or in this place or in that place. These are the different opinions, ideas, concepts, and understandings concerning the worship of God. We may have been caught up by the issue of the worship of God. However, we may have neglected and forgotten that to worship God is altogether not according to the outward way, but is a matter in our spirit. The One whom we worship is not outward. He is a Spirit. His nature and essence is Spirit, just as the nature and essence of a table is wood. We must realize that the very One whom we worship does not demand that we worship Him in a certain place or in a certain way. He is a Spirit essentially. We cannot touch electricity with a piece of wood. We must use metal to touch electricity, to become electrified. In the same way, only the spirit of man can touch this God who is Spirit (v. 24). Talk about ways means nothing.<p>The Jews learned the things concerning the worship of God from the writings of Moses, and the Samaritans learned the worship of God from the same writings. History tells us that the Samaritans had the Pentateuch and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament, as did the Jews. Both peoples had the same portion of the Bible, but they had different interpretations. The Jews said that they had to worship God on Mount Zion, the central part of Jerusalem. But the Samaritans said they must worship in Samaria. In these two places, two peoples held two concepts. The one people said that their concept was according to the Bible, and the other people said that their concept was more according to the Bible. This sinful, despised, and clever woman brought the question of worship to the Lord Jesus. She wanted to know who was right and who was wrong. She only had the knowledge concerning the worship of God. The mere knowledge concerning the worship of God means nothing. If you are really concerned about the worship of God, you must know that the very God whom we worship is Spirit in essence. Worship does not depend upon regulation, knowledge, a place, or any ways. It all depends upon what part of your being you use to worship-your spirit, your mind, or your body.<p>When I visited Jerusalem, I saw Moslems worship God by prostrating themselves on the ground. I said within myself, &#8220;What are you doing there? Don&#8217;t you realize that this is abominable in the eyes of God?&#8221; They took off their shoes because they considered their place of worship to be sacred, and they replaced them with special, expensive slippers. Then they got in a line and followed everyone else to bow down several times. They worshipped God by an exercise of their physical bodies. However, the Lord Jesus told us that worship is neither in this place or in that place, and neither in our mind or our body, but in our spirit. &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit...&#8221; (John 4:24). We must exercise our spirit. It is possible that we may talk much about the worship of God but forget that the worship of God could only be prevailing in our spirit. Do not talk about the ways or the &#8220;hows.&#8221; We must realize that anything concerning God must be in our spirit. Turn to the spirit. This must be renewed among us. We should say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about the worship of God. Turn to your spirit.&#8221; What matters is neither Samaria nor Jerusalem but our spirit, because the very One whom we worship is Spirit, and we can contact Him in and with our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIQUE ONE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN</h2><p>In John 8 the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery to the Lord. They knew the law and asked the Lord in a way to tempt Him, &#8220;Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons. What then do you say?&#8221; (v. 5). The Lord Jesus did not answer quickly. Again He was wise. A wise man does not do things quickly; he learns to be slowed down. The way the Lord &#8220;slowed down&#8221; was to stoop down and write with His finger on the ground (v. 6). This was a sign done by the Lord to teach the scribes the lesson of humility. They should not have stood up straight in a proud way. One might have proudly said, &#8220;I am a Pharisee. I know the law.&#8221; Another might have said, &#8220;I am a scribe, a doctor of the law.&#8221; The Lord Jesus stooped down to write something on the ground. Students of the Bible can only guess what He wrote. It may be that He was writing, &#8220;Who is without sin among you?&#8221; When they persisted in questioning Him, He said, &#8220;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&#8221; (v. 7). This word touched their conscience.<p>When the Lord Jesus answered the Samaritan woman in John 4, He indicated to her that He was the very God incarnate and that the living water that she needed and that He would give her was the Spirit. The Lord&#8217;s answer to the scribes and Pharisees in John 8, although it was so simple, indicated that only One in this universe is without sin. Only Jesus is without sin. The Lord&#8217;s answer was wise, indicating that He was the only one who was qualified to condemn such a sinful woman. No one else, even the Pharisees who were self-righteous, dared to say they were without sin. When they heard this word, they slipped away, beginning with the older ones until the last (v. 9).<p>In this situation it did not matter whether the woman should be stoned or not. It was a matter of who is qualified. Only the Lord Jesus Himself is the One without sin. Today we may know so much of the Bible. We may know the spiritual regulations which may be used to condemn people. But actually, none of us is qualified to condemn anyone. When you are condemning others, you must realize that you also are sinful. Who can say they are without sin?<p>Quite often the sisters are more fine than the brothers. The finer ones always condemn the rough ones. Perhaps the husbands do not condemn as much as the wives do. Husbands suffer the fine condemnation from the wives. A wife may condemn her husband for having dirt on his tie. However, are you, the wife, without dirt? Very few people are accustomed to condemning themselves. We are all accustomed to condemning others. It is so easy for you to see others&#8217; wrongdoings twice as well as your own. How many days in the past year have you criticized others? If there has been one day in which you never criticized anyone, you must be a unique person. You criticize your mother and father and anyone you see. You may criticize your relatives and even the elders. Whether you are fifteen or fifty years old, has there ever been anything you saw in others that you did not criticize? You may criticize whatever you see.<p>In the church life, we see each other every day. If it were possible to hide myself from seeing anyone, I would do it. The best way to save yourself from criticizing others is not to know so many things. For many years as I traveled to minister the Word, I was a guest in people&#8217;s houses. Often I was tempted to see what was in people&#8217;s homes. However, I did not do it, for I have learned the lesson. The outward man prefers to see, but the inward man says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that. That is not allowed. You have no right to look. If you look, you will have to make a thorough confession.&#8221; After being prohibited from looking in one place, I have turned around and been tempted to look in another place. Immediately I was stopped again. To know people&#8217;s secrets is a sin.<p>Whenever we are going to condemn or criticize others, we should be reminded that we are not the One who is without sin. Rather, we are one who is with sin, and we need that One who is without sin. He is our Savior. He is the only one without sin, and we need Him. Remembering this will spontaneously stop our criticism. Do not ask who is right and who is wrong. Only One is absolutely right. None of us has the right to say we are right. We are wrong, and we need the One who is right.<p>If there were no criticism in the church life, ninety percent of the deadening would be annulled. In the church life, there is always a certain deadening going on. We deaden others through our criticism. Even some of our children know how to criticize the speakers in a meeting, and they know how to criticize the elders. If we can get rid of the criticism in the church life, ninety percent of the deadening will be swallowed up by life.<p>The very God in John 4 who is Spirit and the very One in John 8 who is without sin is the Triune God embodied in Christ and come to us as life. It is not a matter of being right or wrong. It is altogether a matter of life, and there is only one who is life, Jesus Christ, who is the embodied God and the very One that is without sin. He is our need. He is the very God, He is the very life, and He is also the Spirit today. We need Him. If you would bring any questions to Him, He would not answer you &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; He would always remind you that you can never be right. In His eyes we are wrong in everything.<h2 class=head1>RECOGNIZING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD</h2><p>In John 9 is the case of a man blind from birth. The disciples had learned a certain amount of theology among the Jews. According to their theology they reckoned that if a man is born blind, there must have been someone who sinned. They asked the Lord, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?&#8221; (v. 2). Jesus answered, &#8220;Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him&#8221; (v. 3). This case is a small one, but its principle is very great.<p>When we encounter a situation of blindness, we like to determine the reason for it. We consider whether it was due to our sin or due to others&#8217; mistakes. Quite often we cannot find out whose mistake it was. We do not know whether it was due to ourselves, our parents, or our wife. We must realize that God is sovereign. God allowed a man to be born blind. This was not due to his parents&#8217; sin or his own, but that God would use this blindness to show His mighty work. God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to come into the world. One needed to be born blind so that Christ might do something for him. If no one had been blind, there would have been no opportunity for the Lord Jesus to be manifested by healing such blindness. This was God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p>In John 4 the sinful and clever woman raised the question of worship to God. In chapter eight the scribes and Pharisees raised a question concerning the laws, the regulations, in their religion. Now in chapter nine the disciples raised a good question of theology. The question of who was at fault for the blindness of the man was a question of theology. However, theology is not adequate to answer this question.<p>Many things happen to us which are not so good. To our realization and analysis there is no reason for these things. However, these things did not happen spontaneously. They happened according to God&#8217;s sovereignty. Sometimes young people who get married repent of their decision after three days. Some have come to me saying they made a big mistake. They were told that they should be very careful in this matter, but they did not take the word of advice. Eventually, they repented. It is good that they repented, but what shall they do now? They have to suffer for the rest of their life. Some may ask in a theological way, &#8220;Whose mistake was this?&#8221; We cannot say whose mistake it was. Yet, there was a mistake. It seems that there was no cause for this mistake. However, deep within I have realized that the cause was the sovereignty of God. God is sovereign that you seem to have married the wrong person. In a certain sense, there are not many right marriages. After being married for a certain period of time, whose marriage is still so right? However, we have to admit that God is sovereign. Every marriage is under God&#8217;s sovereignty. It is neither your mistake nor your spouse&#8217;s. It is God&#8217;s sovereignty that you were married. By reading history and biographies we can learn that thousands of Christians received the greatest help through their marriage. No one can help you so much in seeking after God as your wife. Thank God for your dear wife. Many wives also would thank God for their husbands. Along with all the suffering they may have received from their husbands, there has been something so profitable for them; by no other means could they have been so benefited. Our marriage is not up to our choice. Regardless of how much we exercise in choosing our spouse, we may make a mistake. The more careful we would be, the more serious a mistake we might make.<p>Every parent wants to have good children. However, experienced parents do not dare to say that their children will be the best. In the matter of raising children, the experienced parents have been subdued. It is not up to us whether our children will be good or bad. That is altogether up to the sovereignty of God. If you have good children, you have to worship God. If you have some bad children, you have to worship God more because you will be much more benefited. We might prefer that our first child obtain a Ph.D., that the second be a medical doctor, and that the third be the state governor. We want a wonderful family with wonderful children. We would say, &#8220;Look at this. Isn&#8217;t this the blessing of God?&#8221; In actuality, however, our first child may have a very low IQ, the second one may be crippled, and the third one may be rebellious. Not one of them may be good. Quite often it happens this way. We believe in God&#8217;s sovereignty. Regardless of what kind of circumstance or situation we are in, it is sovereign of God that He might show His mercy upon us and give us more grace.<p>The man in John 9 was blind from birth apparently without cause. But this afforded Jesus Christ the best opportunity to manifest the works of God, to show that God can make a man who was blind from birth receive his sight. This was something of God for His glory. We should not talk about things according to our theology or knowledge, analyzing the cause. This will not work. We must admit that God&#8217;s sovereignty prevails. Whether you will get a better job or lose your current job is altogether up to God&#8217;s sovereignty. I do hope that many will have a pleasant church life, but only God knows whether or not our life will be pleasant. However, we can be assured that whatever turns out, we are under God&#8217;s sovereignty. God&#8217;s sovereignty always results in His kindness, grace, peace, and security to us. We all must learn not to analyze any situation according to &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no,&#8221; but according to the very sovereign God.<h2 class=head1>HAVING THE ONE WHO IS RESURRECTION</h2><p>In John 11 is the unusual and interesting case of Lazarus. When Lazarus was seriously ill, his two sisters, Martha and Mary, sent news to the Lord Jesus. Ordinarily, upon receiving the report, Jesus would immediately have gone to care for the sick one, but in this case He did not. Rather, He purposely delayed His visit for two days (v. 6). After two days, His disciples might have become disappointed. They may have asked, &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t You do something for Lazarus?&#8221; After they were disappointed, the Lord Jesus told them that they would go to see Lazarus.<p>When Jesus arrived at Bethany, Martha came out to meet Him. She said, &#8220;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&#8221; (v. 21). The Lord indicated to her that whether He was late or on time meant nothing because He was there as the resurrection (v. 25). It is as if He said, &#8220;Resurrection does not depend on time. Whether I come earlier or later, I am the resurrection. As long as you have Me, resurrection is here. Do not blame Me. I purposely came late to show you something. Do not be concerned with time. Your brother will be resurrected.&#8221; However, Martha replied, &#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day&#8221; (v. 24). She qualified the resurrection with a certain time. The Lord answered, &#8220;Everyone who lives and believes in Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?&#8221; (v. 26). Martha said, &#8220;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ&#8221; (v. 27). She answered according to her religious, theological concept, not at all according to the Lord&#8217;s meaning. In this respect, she was our typical representative. Resurrection is not a matter of being late or on time. It is a matter of whether or not we have Him. Forget about time, the surroundings, the circumstances, and the situations. All this means nothing. Only one thing counts, and that is His presence, whether or not you have Him right now.<p>The case in John 4 shows us that the worship of God is not a matter of this way or that way, of here or there. It is a matter of being in our spirit. The case in chapter eight shows us that the knowledge of the regulations of religion means nothing. We must realize that we are as sinful as others, and we must be reminded that we need the very One who is without sin, Christ. The criticizers need Christ. We have no right, position, or qualification to criticize because we also have sin. Rather, we need One who is without sin, and this One is the living Jesus. Today this living Jesus is the very Spirit who is in our spirit. When you are going to criticize others, turn to your spirit. Your spirit will tell you, &#8220;Don&#8217;t criticize. You are the same as that one. She is sinful, and you also are not without sin. Rather, you need One to rescue you from your sin. This One is Jesus Christ, the unique One without sin.&#8221;<p>The case in chapter nine shows us that whatever situation we are in should remind us that we need Jesus, and this very Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit. When we seek to learn the cause of our situations, we should realize that the cause is simply God&#8217;s sovereignty. God is sovereign. God intended for you to be in that situation. You do not need to be bothered about the reason. To seek for the reason is merely something of theology.<p>While the case in chapter four shows us that the worship of God is not a matter of place, the case in chapter eleven reveals that the resurrection is not a matter of time. It is a matter of a living Person. As long as we have Him, we have the resurrection.<p>If we expect to have a good church life, we must learn from these four cases. Forget about the place, regulations, the cause, and the time. Forget about criticizing others, regardless of whether they are right, wrong, or even seriously wrong. If you see their wrongdoing, you must be reminded that you are wrong also. They may be wrong in one way, but you are wrong in another way. You are not without sin. Then you must be reminded that you need Christ as the life-giving Spirit to rescue you from your sin. If we would have a good church life, we surely must learn all these lessons.<h2 class=head1>NOT GOOD OR EVIL BUT LIFE</h2><p>In 1943 I became very sick and could do nothing for two and a half years. During that time I was away from the meetings, my family, my home, and the work. Quite often I was alone with the Lord. It was at that time that the Lord showed me the two trees in Genesis 2. The first tree is the tree of life. Life is the processed Triune God; the tree of life indicates God, Christ, and the life-giving Spirit as one Person. The other tree is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Throughout those two and a half years, I repented very much of my work and ministry that was much according to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, with little of the tree of life. I was enlightened very much during that time.<p>In 1942 there was a turmoil in the church in Shanghai against Brother Nee, and he became the target of certain attacks. Due to this and the persecution by the invading Japanese army, the church stopped meeting there. A number of the lovers of the Lord still remained there. They did not leave the church, but there was no church life. At the same time Brother Nee&#8217;s ministry was stopped. He could not minister for four years. In the summertime of 1946 the churches in Nanking and Shanghai began again to meet with a small number, and I was invited to visit them. Some brothers came to me with the same question: &#8220;Could you say that Brother Nee was never wrong?&#8221; They wanted a yes or no answer. This was the right time for me. I had just seen something of the tree of life and had repented that my past had been so much in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, involving matters of right or wrong and yes or no. Therefore, I dared not to answer yes or no. I dared not to exercise anything of the tree of knowledge.<p>I had only one reply to their question. I asked, &#8220;Before you thought that Brother Nee was wrong, how was your spiritual life?&#8221; The questioners all answered that they had been very living. Then I asked, &#8220;How has your spiritual life been since you took the position that Brother Nee was wrong?&#8221; Some wept, saying that their spiritual life had been in chaos. I told them, &#8220;This is a strong indication that the Lord Jesus does not want us to pay attention to whether others are right or wrong. When you touch this matter, you touch death. Even if you were right, you were deadened, and when you spoke of such a thing to others, they also were deadened. Then there was a strong spreading of death in the church life. It is not a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of life or death. It does not matter whether you spread the truth or mere rumors. Whatever you touch that deadens you also deadens everyone else.&#8221;<p>I pointed out to them the four cases from the Gospel of John. I showed them that when the Lord was on the earth, questions always came to Him, and people wanted Him to answer yes or no, right or wrong, good or evil. The Lord Jesus never answered in this way. Rather, He always pointed people to life. It is not a matter of right or wrong; it is not a matter of good or evil; and it is not a matter of yes or no. It is a matter of life. We must be enlivened, and we must enliven others and the whole church. We should avoid speaking anything that deadens us, the saints, or the church.<p>Our need is the very Triune God who was embodied to be our Savior, Jesus Christ, and who became through His death and resurrection a life-giving Spirit. Today we must take Him as our center, goal, and object, forgetting about all the religious things, such as the things concerning regulations and the worship of God. We do not care for anything but this one living Person, who is life, resurrection, God, the Spirit, and the reality of all the divine things to us. If we take Him, we will always be enlivened, and we will enliven others and enliven the entire church life. Our need today is to seek after this living Person.<h1 class=msg>TWO KINDS OF FRUIT OUT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:16-26; 2 Pet. 1:3-11; John 15:16</h1><p>In this chapter we want to see the truth of the two kinds of fruit out of the divine life. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, there is a divine principle set up by God as His design, as His economy. This design is that God wants to dispense Himself into us human beings to live in us as our life. This divine life is a producing life, producing two kinds of fruit. God&#8217;s intention for man is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis. God created man according to His image with the intention that man could be His vessel to contain and express Him (1:26). God Himself wanted to be man&#8217;s contents. He brought man to the tree of life in Genesis 2 because He had the desire to be within man as man&#8217;s life (vv. 8-9). This unique tree of life, which was seen at the beginning of the Bible, is also seen at its conclusion in Revelation 22. It signifies God Himself as life to us.<p>The human life created by God is mysterious. No one can completely understand our human life. How much more mysterious the divine life is! Because the life of God is so mysterious, God gave us a picture of this life. A picture is better than a thousand words. Immediately after God created man, He brought him to a tree called the tree of life. An apple tree or a peach tree may seemingly be easy to understand, but what about the tree of life? One Bible teacher said that the tree of life was something in the past that has nothing to do with us today. But the tree of life is not something merely in the past. If the tree of life did not have anything to do with us today, we would be altogether in a miserable situation. Thank the Lord that we can enjoy Him as the tree of life today.<p>The Gospel of John shows us the tree of life, illustrating Christ. If we are going to understand the tree of life in Genesis 2, we have to come to the Gospel of John. This book has twenty-one chapters that give a full, detailed explanation of the tree of life being the very embodiment of God, which is Christ. In John 15 Christ told us that He is the vine tree. The Lord Jesus also told us in the Gospel of John, &#8220;I am the...life&#8221; (14:6). He is the vine tree and the life-the tree of life. I believe that the tree of life in Genesis 2 was a vine tree. It was not like a pine tree growing upward and high toward the heavens. If Jesus were such a high and tall tree, His fruit would not be available to us. But Jesus is a vine tree who is so available for man to eat and to enjoy. In Revelation 22 the one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine tree spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life (vv. 1-2).<p>In Revelation 2:7 the Lord said, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&#8221; According to the entire book of Revelation, the paradise of God in 2:7 is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), of which the church is a foretaste today. The paradise of God is today&#8217;s church and tomorrow&#8217;s New Jerusalem. Today we are the church, and in the future the church will be the New Jerusalem. Today&#8217;s church life is God&#8217;s paradise. In the church life, we have some taste that we are in the paradise of God. At times we may be arguing or speaking corrupt things. But while we are meeting together, singing, praising, and praying, we have the feeling that we are in paradise. Sometimes in the church meetings we are in a kind of ecstasy. When I look at the faces of the saints in a meeting, nearly every face is smiling. This is because we are happy in the paradise of God. This world is a terrible place. Even many of the unbelievers agree with this. In today&#8217;s human society, one does not have the taste of paradise; instead, one may have the taste of hell. But when we are in the church life, we are in paradise. The paradise of God is located in the local churches! To be in the church life is to live a life in paradise. Eventually the consummation of the church life in the age to come and in eternity will be the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem is the tree of life growing in the river of water of life for our eating and drinking. That will be our enjoyment in eternity. Even today we have the privilege of eating the tree of life and of &#8220;drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry&#8221; (see Hymns, #322). In the church life, we are in the paradise of God enjoying Christ as the tree of life.<p>Today Christ as the embodiment of God is our tree of life, and this tree of life is growing in us. The Lord Jesus told a parable of a sower going out to sow the seed (Mark 4:1-20). He is both the sower and the seed of life. He sows Himself as the seed of life into us, the earth. We are the earth that grows Christ. On the day we were regenerated, Christ was sown into our being. Our very being is the earth that contains Christ and grows Christ. We have received the divine life, and this very productive divine life is growing within us. We have to grow Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE FRUIT OF CHRISTIAN VIRTUES</h2><p>According to the Bible and according to our experience, this life produces two categories of fruit. Second Peter 1 and Galatians 5 show the first category. The first category of fruit is the category of Christian virtues. Second Peter tells us that we all have been &#8220;allotted like precious faith&#8221; (1:1). Our faith has become our lot from God, a divine lot within us. Most of us understand faith as our believing ability. But we must go further to see that the very faith within us is the Triune God. The Triune God within us becomes the believing ability. Without God within us, there is no way for us to believe. We have been graced by God to believe into Him. We were sinners wandering in the world, and we had no intention of seeking after God. But one day we heard the good news of the gospel and believed into Christ. Formerly we may have thought that it was foolish to be a Christian. But now we think that Jesus is wonderful. Now we are &#8220;fools because of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:10). The Triune God put Himself into us to become our believing ability and also the very object in which we believe. He is the believing ability, and He is the One in whom we believe. Thank Him for the lot of faith we have received!<p>Some time after being saved we may have regretted our decision to be a Christian. We may have tried to leave Christ. When we say we will leave Christ, Someone within us will say, &#8220;You may try to leave Me, but I will not leave you.&#8221; Wherever you go, the Lord will be there. You may say that you do not want Him. But He will say, &#8220;I want you.&#8221; You may say that you do not need Him. But He will say, &#8220;I need you.&#8221; After being saved, many of us regretted that we had received the Lord. You may not like to be a Christian, but the Lord likes it. Our destiny is not up to us but up to Him. Our destiny is under His sovereignty. It was our destiny for the Triune God to come into us to become our allotted faith. The Triune God lives in us to be our believing ability and our believing object.<p>Second Peter 1:3-11 shows that we must add all diligence to supply something in this faith that we have received. In faith we must supply virtue (v. 5). Virtues are the beauties of the divine life. Human beings have some amount of physical beauty. But before we were saved, was our behavior beautiful? We may be handsome or beautiful in our physical appearance, but what about our behavior? When we lose our temper, we may look like a demon. There may be many ugly things in our behavior. But after we were saved, to some extent, we spontaneously became gentle, mild, meek, and humble. Those who knew us may have said, &#8220;Why are you so happy? What happened to you?&#8221; What happened to us was that Jesus came into us. Because He came into us, there was spontaneously an amount of beauty in our behavior of our daily life. We have the God-allotted portion of faith within us, and we have the beauties expressed in our daily life. These expressed beauties are virtues.<p>In virtue we should supply knowledge (v. 5). On the one hand, we are fools because of Christ. On the other hand, we are quite knowledgeable. We know where we came from, where we are, and where we are going. The unbelievers do not know these things. Virtue needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord (vv. 2, 3, 8).<p>Then in knowledge we need to supply self-control (v. 6). Some of the saints become very excited in the church meetings. It is all right for us to get excited in the meetings, but when we get too excited, we need to learn to control ourselves. The young people have to sympathize with the older saints, who may not be able to bear so much shouting. They must learn to control themselves. Self-control is the exercise of control over one&#8217;s self in its passions, desires, and habits. This needs to be supplied and developed in knowledge for the proper growth in life.<p>Then in self-control we have to supply endurance (v. 6). Self-control and endurance go together as &#8220;twin brothers.&#8221; If we have self-control, we surely have endurance. Without self- control, we can never endure anything. Self-control is to deal with ourselves; endurance is to bear with others and with circumstances.<p>In endurance we need to supply godliness (v. 6). Godliness is God expressed. It is a living that is like God and expresses God. When we exercise control over our self and bear with others and with circumstances, godliness needs to be developed in our spiritual life that we may be like God and express Him.<p>In godliness, the expression of God, we need to supply brotherly love (v. 7). Then in this brotherly love, we should supply love, the divine love, the nobler and higher love (v. 7). This love is much higher, stronger, and greater than brotherly love. At this point in the growth in life, we are fully with God, in God, and have God Himself as our love.<p>Faith may be considered as the seed of life, and this nobler love may be considered as the fruit of the seed of life in its full development (v. 8). Faith is God and love is also God. God has allotted Himself to be our portion within us as our faith. Then if we are diligent to supply virtue to faith, knowledge to virtue, self-control to knowledge, endurance to self-control, godliness to endurance, and brotherly love to godliness, we will reach God Himself as the very substance of the divine love. The issue of faith as the seed of life growing within us to its full development is that God and we become one entity. Divinity is mingled with humanity to constitute us into God-men.<p>All of these virtues in 2 Peter 1 are a kind of fruit (v. 8). If we express these virtues day after day, this means that we are very fruitful. Day after day in our daily walk we should bear such fruit. Otherwise, people will not be able to see faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, or the divine love in us. Then we will be barren, unfruitful, in these virtues. If we live by taking Christ as our life, we will bear the fruit of Christian virtues day after day. The virtues in 2 Peter 1 are actually God&#8217;s attributes. God is faith, God is love, and God is all of our Christian virtues. God&#8217;s attributes, or characteristics, become our supply in different aspects. When these divine attributes are expressed through us and by us in our daily walk, they become our virtues. These Christian virtues have been filled up with God&#8217;s attributes. The divine attributes expressed in our human virtues are the Christian virtues, which are the fruit in our character.<p>Galatians 5 is another portion of the Word that tells us about this kind of fruit. Verse 16 says that we have to walk by the Spirit so that we will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. The Spirit and the flesh are fighting against each other all day long. If we walk by the Spirit, we will bear the fruit of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control (vv. 22-23). The fruit of the Spirit is also the divine virtues.<p>In Galatians 5 Paul talked from another angle about the same thing as Peter did. In 2 Peter the divine power, the life power, has given us all things relating to life and godliness (1:3). This divine power is just God Himself, the divine Being, the divine life. Every kind of life has its own power. God is divine, and His life is divine. He is almighty and all-powerful, and He is now within us as our life. Paul did not mention anything about the power of the divine life in Galatians 5, but he referred us to the very Holy Spirit. He said that it is by the Spirit that we can produce the fruit of Christian virtues.<p>On the one hand, the divine life as power gives us the energy to carry out all the beauties of the divine life, the virtues. On the other hand, it is the Holy Spirit by whom we can bear all the spiritual fruit. Actually, the Holy Spirit is the divine power. The Holy Spirit refers to a Person. The divine power is a kind of energy. The Person is the energy. We have to walk by the Holy Spirit as a Person. When we walk by this Person, He becomes our energy, the divine power. When we eat a good breakfast, this breakfast becomes the energy within us to energize us during the day, giving us the strength to do things. We Christians have a divine energy within us that energizes us all day long. This energy is actually a Person, the very Triune God consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit within us. By this Person we can live a life full of virtues, which are the fruit that we bear every day.<h2 class=head1>THE FRUIT OF SAVED PERSONS REGENERATED WITH THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>If we are such fruit-bearing believers in the Christian virtues, the second category of fruit will be borne by us. This second category of fruit is mentioned in John 15. The Lord said that He is the vine tree and we are the branches (v. 5). The branches of the vine tree do not merely bear the fruit of the Christian virtues. The fruit borne by the branches in John 15 denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches (v. 16b). This is proved by the requirement that the bearer of this fruit should &#8220;go forth&#8221; (v. 16a). To bear ethical and moral virtues as fruit does not require us to go forth. But to bear the fruit of persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth to contact and reach people. We Christians should bear both the fruit of virtues and the fruit of regenerated persons.<p>If a fruit tree in an orchard does not bear any fruit, the farmer will want to cut it down. There is no beauty in a fruit tree that does not bear fruit. How would a branch of a vine look without any grapes on it? A branch with clusters of grapes on it looks beautiful. We need to bear not only the fruit of virtues as the beauties of the divine life but also the fruit of solid persons.<p>If you are not a person that bears the first category of fruit, the fruit of virtues, you will not be prevailing in the gospel regardless of what way you use. Your preaching can only be prevailing when you bear the fruit of virtues. You must be a person that lives by the divine power within you, walking by and with a Holy Person, the Holy Spirit. You must be a person living by Christ as your life and walking with the Holy Spirit as your companion to bear much fruit of virtues. Then when you speak Christ in the preaching of the gospel, the second category of fruit will be there, the fruit of persons. If you live in the flesh and the natural life during the day, you will be a &#8220;flat tire&#8221; in the evening and will not have the standing before God&#8217;s enemy to preach the gospel. If you are a Christian that lives by Christ and walks with the Spirit, you will be full of virtues, full of beauties. Then when you go to touch sinners, all the demons will be afraid of you. This is why the gospel in the mouths of the apostles was prevailing. The word of the apostles was weighty. The same word spoken by us may be light and vain. Thus, we have to be persons bearing the fruit of the Christian virtues, which are the very expression of the divine attributes. Then we are qualified and empowered to speak Christ. The word out of our mouths will be a power to save people. The preaching of the gospel depends upon the person rather than the way. If you are not the right person, it does not matter what way you take. That way will be empty.<h2 class=head1>BEARING TWO KINDS OF FRUIT FOR A RICH ENTRANCE INTO THE COMING KINGDOM</h2><p>We all need to rise up to have a new start. We need to forget the past, look to the Lord, and tell Him, &#8220;Lord, I am here. I want to have a new start. I want to forget about everything in the past, even the past history of my Christian life and church life. Lord, I realize that You are the divine power within me, energizing me all day long. Lord, as the Spirit You are my companion living with me. I want to live by You and to walk with You. I want to forget about everything related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, involving matters of right or wrong and yes or no. I want to have a clean, purified, and absolutely new start with You.&#8221; We need such a divine beginning. In simplicity we should take Christ as our divine power, energizing within us, and take Him as the life- giving Spirit, the very companion with whom we should walk all day. Then we will bear the fruit of virtues, expressing the divine attributes to be empowered, energized, and qualified to speak Christ as the gospel to others. Our speaking will be powerful and weighty. Week after week we will see the fruit of solid persons added to the fruit of our virtues. We will bear not only the fruit of the attributes of God as our virtues but also the fruit of saved, solid persons added to our virtues. We will be full of fruit in two categories: the category of virtues and the category of solid persons. We need the fruit in these two categories to afford us a rich, bountiful entrance into the coming kingdom. Many students in a school graduate, but only a few graduate with a prize or a reward. If we are faithful to bear these two kinds of fruit in this age, we will have a new church life, and we will enjoy the Lord as our reward in the coming kingdom age.</body></html>
