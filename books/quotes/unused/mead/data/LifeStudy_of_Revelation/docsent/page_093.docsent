   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ, the slain Lamb, is worthy, and a number of Christian hymns praise the Lord for His worthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, most hymns on the worthiness of the Lamb praise Christ for being worthy because of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult to find a hymn on the Lord s worthiness that goes beyond redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is absolutely scriptural to say that the Lamb is worthy because He has redeemed and purchased us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, according to Revelation 5, the worthiness of the Lamb is not mainly due to His redemption, but to His being able to open the secret of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is worthy to open the seals of God s economy because He has defeated the enemy and has redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the One who has brought God s authority to the earth, He is the victorious, overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Lamb who has accomplished a full redemption for God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, He is completely qualified and positioned to open the mystery of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is one of the crucial points in Revelation chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SEVEN EYES, THE SEVEN LAMPS,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND THE SEVEN SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another major point in Revelation 5 is that Christ as the Lion-Lamb has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God v. 6 . These seven eyes are also the seven lamps burning before the throne of God 4:5 . Hence, in these chapters we have the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation is the only book in the Bible that mentions the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But here we see that these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, and that the seven eyes of Christ are the seven lamps before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first mention of the seven lamps is in Exodus 25, where we see seven lamps on the one lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we only had Exodus 25, we would not know the meaning of the lampstand and its seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to our human understanding, we would simply say that the seven lamps are for the intensification of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this is both right and logical, the significance of the seven lamps is much deeper than this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did the lampstand not have six or eight lamps?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Zechariah we see something further regarding the seven lamps, for in Zechariah 3 and 4 we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes Zech 3:9; 4:2,10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Zechariah 4:10 speaks of the seven eyes of the Lord, the connection between the eyes, the lamps, and the Spirit is not made clear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we need to proceed further to the book of Revelation, where we see the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to see the progression from Exodus through Zechariah to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Exodus we have the seven lamps, in Zechariah we have the seven eyes, and in Revelation we have the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus the seven lamps are mentioned, but nothing is said of the eyes or of the Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Zechariah we have the seven lamps and the seven eyes with an obscure mention of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in Revelation we have the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we pointed out in message eight, the lampstand is a symbol of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gold symbolizes the divine substance of the Father; the stand, which is the embodiment of the gold, symbolizes Christ as the embodiment of the Father; and the seven lamps symbolize the Spirit as the expression of Christ who is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we have the Father the gold as the substance, the Son the stand as the embodiment, and the Spirit the lamps as the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have the substance, the embodiment, and the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Exodus we cannot see that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must go on to Zechariah and eventually to Revelation before we can see this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a recovery of divine revelation, this is absolutely new.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The lamps in Exodus 25 are for the building up of the tabernacle, especially for the move in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without light, it is impossible to move.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The light is for the move, and the move is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven lamps, therefore, are for the building up of the tabernacle, God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seven lamps in Zechariah 3 and 4 are for the recovery of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The principle is the same in the rebuilding of the temple as it was in the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same is true of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we approach this book with a shortsighted view, we shall be unable to see that the seven Spirits, which are the seven eyes of the Lamb and the seven lamps before God s throne, are for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if we have an overall view, we shall see that the seven Spirits are absolutely for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation begins with the seven local churches and it ends with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although this book contains the judgment of God, this judgment is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Judgment is not for judgment; it is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Jerusalem, God s eternal dwelling place, issues out of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits are all for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are here for the realization of God s eternal goal in His divine building.</S>
