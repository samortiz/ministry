<h1 class="title">The Heavenly Christ&mdash;<br />
a Kingly and Divine High Priest</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 7:1&mdash;8:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly Christ, and the chief point concerning the heavenly Christ is that He is a Priest not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec&mdash;1:3; 4:14; 8:1; 9:24; 12:2; 5:6, 10; 6:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Hebrews is primarily concerned with the priesthood of Christ, and all the aspects of Christ in chapters one through six are the necessary qualifications for Him to be a kingly and divine High Priest, who can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost&mdash;8:1; 7:11, 25.</li>
	<li>The heavenly Christ revealed in Hebrews is the present Christ&mdash;the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne in the heavens, who is our daily salvation and our moment-by-moment supply&mdash;8:2; 4:14-15; 7:26.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to the work and ministry of Christ, the book of Hebrews makes a great turn in 7:1, a turn from the outer court on earth to the Holy of Holies in heaven&mdash;8:2; 9:11-12, 24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This turn is from the altar for sin in the outer court to the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies, where God meets with us and speaks with us and where we are one with God in His economy&mdash;13:10; 10:12; 4:16.</li>
	<li>This turn is from the suffering Jesus on earth to the glorified Christ on the throne of God in the heavens&mdash;7:26; 12:2; 8:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to pass through the physical realm of Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry and enter into the mystical realm of Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;I am burdened to tell you that you need to enter into a realm, a sphere, a kingdom, which is much higher than the realm you are in now. This higher realm is the mystical realm of Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry&rdquo; (<em>The Divine and Mystical Realm,</em> p. 25).</li>
	<li>Regarding these two realms, there is a sharp contrast: earthly versus heavenly, physical versus mystical, judicial versus organic, and objective versus subjective:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His flesh Christ carried out His earthly ministry by accomplishing God&rsquo;s judicial redemption objectively in the physical realm&mdash; Col. 1:22; Heb. 9:12-15.</li>
		<li>As the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17) Christ in His heavenly ministry is accomplishing God&rsquo;s organic salvation subjectively in the mystical realm&mdash; Rom. 5:10.</li>
		<li>Today we are not being saved judicially and objectively by Christ in the flesh in the physical realm of His earthly ministry; rather, we are being saved organically and subjectively by Christ as the life-giving Spirit in the mystical realm of His heavenly ministry.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we would enjoy the heavenly ministry of Christ, the heavenly Christ must become subjectively objective to us in our experience&mdash;Heb. 1:3; 13:21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is objective, but we may have the subjective experience of the objective Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:34, 10; Col. 3:1; 1:27.</li>
	<li>Christ is now the Lord in the heavens and also the Spirit within us&mdash;Acts 2:33a; 5:31; Eph. 1:19-21; 2 Cor. 3:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord in the heavens and the Spirit in our spirit are one&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		<li>Whatever the Lord carries out in the heavens, He applies to us as the Spirit in our spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>At Bethel, the house of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the heavenly ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth&mdash;Gen. 28:10-17; John 1:51; Eph. 2:22; Heb. 4:12, 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As a kingly and divine High Priest constituted with the power of an indestructible life, the perfected Son of God is interceding for us that we may be saved to the uttermost&mdash;Heb. 7:15-17, 24-26, 28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is kingly according to His royal status and divine according to His divine nature, the basic element that constitutes Him to be a divine High Priest&mdash;7:1, 28.</li>
	<li>Christ has been constituted the High Priest according to the powerful element of an indestructible life, the divine, eternal, uncreated, resurrection life that has passed through death and Hades; therefore, His divine priesthood is the presence of life and the absence of death&mdash; 7:16, 23-25; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18.</li>
	<li>The divine High Priest is the perfected Son of God&mdash;Heb. 7:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16) Christ needed no perfecting, because He is eternally perfect; however, as the firstborn Son of God (Heb. 1:6; Rom. 8:29) He has been perfected through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</li>
		<li>The firstborn Son of God is completely perfected, equipped, and qualified to be our divine High Priest.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As our High Priest Christ cares for us by interceding for us&mdash;Heb. 7:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved to the uttermost and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Heb. 9:24; Rom. 8:34.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s interceding will motivate our inner life-seed to develop, grow, and permeate our whole being that we may be transformed and conformed to His image and ultimately be brought into His glorification&mdash;Mark 4:26-29; Matt. 13:3-8; Rom. 12:2; 8:29-30; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As our High Priest Christ is the heavenly Minister, ministering heaven as a condition of life into our spirit that we may have the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power to live a heavenly life on earth&mdash;8:2.</li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The New Covenant<br />
(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">Its Definition and Enactment</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:7-13; 9:1, 15-23; 10:19;<br />
Matt. 26:27-28; Luke 22:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but also a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us&mdash;Heb. 9:15-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A covenant and a testament are the same, but when the maker of the covenant is living, it is a covenant, and when he has died, it is a testament.</li>
	<li>A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people; a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor.</li>
	<li>If we would understand the new covenant, we need to know the difference between a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s covenant is enacted upon God&rsquo;s promise, which is a common, ordinary word without confirmation&mdash;8:6.</li>
		<li>After God made His promise, He sealed it with an oath, swearing by His Godhead that His promise would be fulfilled&mdash;6:13, 17.</li>
		<li>After God&rsquo;s promise had been confirmed by an oath, it immediately became the covenant sealed by God&mdash;8:7-8.</li>
		<li>The One who made the covenant died so that the covenant might become a testament, a will&mdash;9:16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The contents of the new covenant are the contents of the entire New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bequests bequeathed to us by the Lord in the new testament are inexhaustible, and they are for us to experience and enjoy through the Spirit for eternity&mdash;9:15.</li>
		<li>In the new covenant God gives us forgiveness, salvation, life, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings&mdash;Eph. 1:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new covenant, which the Lord Jesus enacted, is better than the old covenant, the first covenant, made through Moses&mdash;Heb. 7:22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The new covenant is new in nature, quality, and form&mdash;8:8-13; Luke 22:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The old covenant was faulty, weak, and unprofitable; hence, it was annulled&mdash;Heb. 7:18; 8:7.</li>
		<li>The new covenant is eternal and is eternally effective&mdash;13:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new covenant is a better covenant&mdash;7:22; 8:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The new covenant was enacted upon better promises and consummated with Christ&rsquo;s better sacrifices and the better blood of Christ&mdash;Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:10-12; 9:23, 12, 14.</li>
		<li>The High Priest of this better covenant ministers with a more excellent ministry in the greater and more perfect tabernacle&mdash;8:6; 9:11.</li>
		<li>Whereas the old covenant was lifeless, made with the outward law of letters, the new covenant is constituted with the indestructible life&mdash;7:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The old covenant was a covenant of law; the new covenant is a covenant of grace&mdash;7:19; 10:29; 12:15, 28; 13:9; Gal. 4:22-26.</li>
	<li>In the old covenant all things were shadows; in the new covenant everything is reality&mdash; Heb. 10:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to the divine principle, God&rsquo;s covenant required the offerings and the blood; hence, the new covenant was enacted with the better sacrifices and with the blood that speaks something better&mdash;9:23; 12:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the offerings and He is also the One who shed the better blood to enact the new covenant and to make this covenant a will full of divine bequests.</li>
	<li>In the new covenant Christ, the unique sacrifice, is the reality of all the offerings:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than those of animals&mdash;9:23; 10:11.</li>
		<li>Christ offered Himself as one sacrifice, and as the unique sacrifice He has dealt with sins once for all&mdash;9:14; 10:12; 1:3; 2:17; 7:27; 9:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The enactment of the new covenant required the shedding of the blood of the God-man, the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, for the forgiveness of sins&mdash;Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20; 1 John 1:7; Heb. 9:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s blood has been shed for the forgiveness of sins, and the new covenant has been enacted with His blood&mdash;Matt. 26:28.</li>
		<li>This precious blood speaks for us that by it the new covenant may be enacted; hence, it is called &ldquo;the blood of an eternal covenant&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 12:24; 13:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;This cup is the new covenant established in My blood&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 22:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion.</li>
		<li>The blood is the price that Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed that God made for us, and the cup is the portion that we receive from God.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 7:25; 9:15; 7:22; 8:2;<br />
13:20; 12:1-2; 9:14; 10:29</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>As the ascended One sitting on the throne in the heavens, Christ is now executing the new covenant, which He has bequeathed to us as a testament, interceding for us and ministering to us that we may realize, experience, and enjoy all the bequests contained in the new testament&mdash;Heb. 12:2; 7:25; 8:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The new testament, the will, has been validated by Christ&rsquo;s death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection and ascension.</li>
	<li>The new covenant has been bequeathed to us as the new testament, and now, in the mystical realm of His heavenly ministry, Christ is executing what He has bequeathed.</li>
	<li>Christ is now in the heavens, living, divine, and capable; He is able to execute the new testament in every detail, making every bequest in it available and real to us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the divine High Priest, Christ is executing the new covenant by interceding for us, praying that we would be brought into the reality of the new covenant&mdash;7:25.</li>
		<li>As the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant, Christ in His heavenly ministry is executing the new testament and carrying out in us every item of its bequests&mdash;8:6; 9:15; 12:24.</li>
		<li>As the surety of the new covenant, Christ is the pledge that everything in the new covenant will be fulfilled; He guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament&mdash;7:22.</li>
		<li>As the Minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, Christ is serving us with the bequests, the blessings, of the new testament, making the facts of the new covenant effective in our experience&mdash;8:2.</li>
		<li>As the great Shepherd of the sheep, Christ, by His shepherding, is consummating the New Jerusalem according to God&rsquo;s eternal covenant&mdash;13:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we would receive the application of all the blessings in the new covenant, we need to be those who respond to Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry&mdash;Heb. 12:1-2; Col. 3:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s ministry in the heavens to execute the new covenant requires our response&mdash;Heb. 7:25; 4:16; 10:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For centuries Christ has tried without adequate success to gain a group of people to respond to His ministry in the heavens.</li>
		<li>By His mercy and grace, there is on earth today a group of people in the recovery responding to the heavenly ministry of Christ.</li>
		<li>As the Head is in the heavens interceding for us and ministering to us, we, the Body, are on earth responding to Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry, corresponding to and reflecting what He is doing to execute the new covenant&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our eyes must be opened to see the heavenly vision of the new testament, the will, with all its bequests&mdash;Eph. 1:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Father promised everything, and the Lord Jesus accomplished everything; now all the accomplished facts have been itemized in the will as our bequests&mdash;Luke 22:20; Heb. 9:16-17.</li>
		<li>If we have the heavenly vision to see that all God&rsquo;s blessings are bequests in the will, we will pray not as poor beggars but as glorious inheritors, receiving the bequests by faith&mdash; Rom. 8:17; Eph. 3:6; Heb. 6:17; 1:14.</li>
		<li>If we have the heavenly view of the new testament, our concept will be changed, we will be radically revolutionized, and we will be beside ourselves with praise to the Lord&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:13; Rev. 5:6-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to realize that the blood of Christ is the blood of the covenant&mdash;Heb. 9:14, 18-22; 10:29; 13:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the book of Hebrews the blood of Christ is particularly prominent and crucial:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Through this blood Christ entered once for all into the Holy of Holies and obtained an eternal redemption for us&mdash; 9:12.</li>
			<li>By this blood Christ cleansed the heavens and all things in the heavens&mdash;9:22-24.</li>
			<li>This blood sanctifies us, purifies our conscience to serve the living God, and speaks something better for us than the blood of Abel&mdash;13:12; 10:29; 9:14; 12:24.</li>
			<li>In this blood we have boldness for entering the Holy of Holies&mdash;10:19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The blood of Christ is the blood of the covenant&mdash;10:29; 13:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It is the blood of the eternal covenant, with which the new and better covenant was enacted&mdash;10:29; 13:20; Luke 22:20.</li>
			<li>The blood of the covenant is not mainly for forgiveness; it is primarily for God to be our portion&mdash;Rev. 22:14.</li>
			<li>The blood of the covenant brings us into the Holy of Holies; that is, it brings us into God and into the full enjoyment of God as our portion both now and forever&mdash;Heb. 10:19.</li>
			<li>The blood of the covenant speaks for us, saying that by the blood the new covenant has been enacted and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ who receive this covenant out of faith&mdash; 12:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to come forward to God in faith, coming forward with boldness to the throne of grace to receive mercy and grace and coming forward to the Holy of Holies, having &ldquo;boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;7:25; 11:6; 4:16; 10:19-20.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 42:6; 49:8;<br />
Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Based on the fact that Jeremiah prophesies concerning the new covenant, the book of Jeremiah may be considered an Old Testament book that is also a New Testament book&mdash;Jer. 2:13; 17:9; 13:23; 23:5-6; 31:31-34.</li>
<li>Christ Himself is the new covenant, the new testament, given to us by God&mdash;Isa. 42:6; 49:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s salvation, God&rsquo;s blessings, and all of God&rsquo;s riches have been covenanted to us, and this covenant is Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of all the hundreds of bequests in the New Testament is Christ&mdash;Gen. 22:18a; Gal. 3:14; 1 Cor. 1:30; 15:45b; Eph. 1:3.</li>
		<li>Christ is the reality of the new testament, the reality of all that God is and of all that God has given to us; therefore, Christ is the new testament.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way to receive and enjoy Christ as the covenant to us is to exercise our spirit, to live according to our spirit, and to remain in our spirit, with which is the very Christ, by calling on Christ our Lord&rsquo;s name&mdash;Isa. 42:5-6; Zech. 12:1; Rom. 8:4b; Rev. 1:10a; 2 Tim. 4:22; Isa. 12:3-4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The contents of the new covenant (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12) include the following four blessings as God&rsquo;s bequests to us:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 8:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The law of life, the law of the Spirit of life, is the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2-3, 11, 34.</li>
		<li>The law of life is the spontaneous power of life; it is the natural characteristic and the innate, automatic function of life.</li>
		<li>The function of the law of life is:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To make us God in life, nature, and expression but not in the Godhead, shaping us into the image of the firstborn Son of God so that we may become His corporate expression&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 29.</li>
			<li>To constitute us the members of the Body of Christ with all kinds of functions&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12, 16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We enjoy the dispensing of life into our being for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy by the working of the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.</li>
		<li>We need to cooperate with the installed and operating law of the Spirit of life by &ldquo;switching on&rdquo; this law&mdash;1 Thes. 5:16-18; Luke 8:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 8:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For God to be our God means that He is our inheritance, and for us to be God&rsquo;s people means that He is our inheritance&mdash;Eph. 1:11, 14, 18; 3:21.</li>
		<li>In the new covenant we have the privilege of having God as our God and of being His people&mdash;the enabling of life for us to participate in the enjoyment of God in fellowship with Him so that He can be known by us, apprehended by us, and lived by us&mdash;1 John 1:3, 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;They shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 8:11a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The function of life enables us to know God in the inward way of life.</li>
		<li>We can know God subjectively from within by the sense of life, which is the feeling, the consciousness, of the divine life within us&mdash; Rom. 8:6; Eph. 4:18-19; Phil. 3:10a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The sense of life involves both the feeling of death and the feeling of life and peace&mdash;Rom. 8:6; Isa. 26:3.</li>
			<li>The sense of life makes us know whether we are living in the natural life or in the divine life and whether we are living in the flesh or in the spirit.</li>
			<li>We should live according to the sense of life in the principle of life, not according to the principle of right and wrong, the principle of death.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 8:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ made propitiation for our sins to appease God&rsquo;s righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demands of God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;Heb. 2:17.</li>
		<li>The precious and all-efficacious blood of Christ resolves all our problems so that we can remain constantly in fellowship with God to continually enjoy His organic salvation&mdash;1 John 1:7-9; 2:1-2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (Heb. 9:12, 14), and the efficacy of that cleansing need not be repeated.</li>
			<li>However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Once God forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and remembers them no longer:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Forgiveness of sins means the removal of the charges of sin against us before God that we may be delivered from the penalty of God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;John 3:18; 5:24.</li>
			<li>When God forgives us of our sins, He causes the sins which we have committed to depart from us&mdash;Psa. 103:12; Lev. 16:7-10, 15-22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins results in our fearing Him and loving Him in our restored fellowship with Him&mdash;Psa. 130:4; Luke 7:47.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new covenant will ultimately issue in the New Jerusalem, the embodiment of God&rsquo;s new covenant to express Him in a corporate way to the uttermost for eternity&mdash;Gal. 4:26-28, 31.</li>

<li>The law of the divine life is the spontaneous power of the divine life; it is the natural characteristic and the innate, automatic function of divine life:

	<li>God&rsquo;s life is the highest life, and the law of this life is the highest law&mdash;Isa. 40:30-31.</li>
	<li>The Triune God has been processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become the law of the Spirit of life installed in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:3, 11, 34, 16.</li>
	<li>There are three different laws in the three different parts of our being:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The law of sin and death is the person of Satan residing in our flesh&mdash;Rom. 7:18, 23.</li>
		<li>The law of good in our mind, that is, in our soul, derives from our natural human life&mdash; Rom. 7:23.</li>
		<li>The law of the Spirit of life is the person of the Triune God installed in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 16:

<li>We need to cooperate with the installed and operating law of the Spirit of life for our organic salvation by &ldquo;switching on&rdquo; this law in the following ways&mdash;Phil. 2:12-13; Rom. 8:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By walking according to the spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4.</li>
	<li>By minding the things of the Spirit, setting our mind on the spirit&mdash;vv. 5-6.</li>
	<li>By putting to death by the Spirit the practices of our body&mdash;v. 13.</li>
	<li>By being led by the Spirit of God to be sons of God&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>By crying &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; in the spirit of sonship&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	<li>By the Spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are God&rsquo;s children&mdash;v. 16.</li>
	<li>By groaning for the full sonship, the redemption of our body&mdash;v. 23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God accomplishes His economy by dispensing Himself into us as the law of life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into our being that our being might be constituted with His being to be one constitution with His being; this can be accomplished only by God imparting Himself into us as the divine life.</li>
	<li>The law of the divine life &ldquo;sonizes&rdquo; us for the building up of the Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the law of life, which is in our spirit, spreads into our inward parts&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;it becomes several laws&mdash; Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This spreading is the imparting, and the imparting is the inscribing.</li>
			<li>By the working, the spreading, of the law of life within us, God makes us the same as He is in life, nature, and expression.</li>
			<li>We are conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God by the working of the law of life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The firstborn Son is the prototype, the standard model, for the mass reproduction of the many sons of God, who are His many brothers to constitute His Body for God&rsquo;s corporate expression&mdash;Rom. 8:29:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s way to mass reproduce this prototype is to work His living prototype, the firstborn Son, into our entire being.</li>
			<li>If we cooperate with and open up to this wonderful prototype, He will spread outward from our spirit into our soul.</li>
			<li>The indwelling prototype, the firstborn Son of God, automatically works in us as the law of life to conform us to His image, to &ldquo;sonize&rdquo; us.</li>
			<li>In His recovery, God is working desperately among us to make every one of us the same as the firstborn Son.</li>
			<li>The Body of Christ as the new man is the corporate reproduction of the standard model, the firstborn Son of God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The law, the divine capacity, of life constitutes us to be the members of the Body of Christ, including all kinds of functions&mdash;the joints of the rich supply and every part of the Body that functions in its measure&mdash;Eph. 4:11, 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The function of the law of life requires the growth in life, for the law of life functions only as it grows:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If a certain life does not grow, the law of that life cannot function.</li>
	<li>The law of life operates only as life grows&mdash; Mark 4:3, 14, 26-29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s intercession on the throne motivates the life-seed that He sowed into us at the time of resurrection&mdash;Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34.</li>
		<li>The firstborn Son is interceding for us so that the life which He has sown into our spirit may be motivated to grow, develop, and saturate all our inward parts until we are completely permeated with His glorified and uplifted being:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Many times our utterances in prayer are quotations of the heavenly intercession; whatever happens to us in our spiritual life is either a quotation of the heavenly intercession or a reaction to it.</li>
			<li>On the one hand, He is in our spirit as life growing; on the other hand, He is on the throne in the heavens interceding for the growth and development of the seed He has sown within us.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>While the divine life grows in us, the law of life functions to shape us, to conform us, to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The law of life does not regulate us from doing wrong; it regulates the shape of life.</li>
		<li>The law of life does not primarily function in the negative sense of telling us what not to do; rather, while life grows, the law of life functions in the positive sense of shaping us, that is, conforming us to the image of Christ.</li>
		<li>Through the function of the law of life, we all shall become the mature sons of God, and God will have His universal, corporate expression.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 9:2-4; Rev. 2:17; 8:3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The diagram of the tabernacle (p. 51) is a detailed picture of Christ and a full definition of our experiences of Christ&mdash;Heb. 8:5, 2; 9:24.</li>
<li>The book of Hebrews reveals that we may experience Christ at the altar and at the laver in the outer court in an outward way, at the showbread table, at the lampstand, and at the incense altar in the Holy Place in an inner way, and at the ark of the testimony and in the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies in the innermost way&mdash;Heb. 9:2-4.</li>
<li>In the ark in the Holy of Holies, we experience the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash; the Father in His divine nature as the source of all supply, Christ as the hidden manna and the resurrection life, and the Spirit of life as the inner law of life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The golden pot signifies the divine nature, the nature of God the Father, who is the unique source&mdash;Heb. 9:4b; 2 Pet. 1:4; Matt. 6:4, 6, 18; 1 Cor. 8:6a; Eph. 3:14-15.</li>
	<li>The hidden manna in the golden pot signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply in the deepest way&mdash;Heb. 9:4c; Exo. 16:33-34; Rev. 2:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The hidden manna is the hidden Christ in His hidden life supply, the topmost portion of Christ hidden in the divine nature&mdash;Col. 3:3-4.</li>
		<li>If we abide in the Holy of Holies, we will enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion of heavenly food reserved for His overcoming seekers&mdash;Rev. 2:17.</li>
		<li>By eating Christ as the hidden manna, we are incorporated into the universal, divine-human incorporation&mdash;John 14:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The tabernacle in the Old Testament is a sign of the universal incorporation.</li>
			<li>The more we eat of Christ as the hidden manna, the more we are incorporated into this universal incorporation.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry&mdash; Heb. 9:4d; Num. 17:1-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The budding, blossoming, fruit-yielding rod signifies the resurrection life of Christ with its authority&mdash;Num. 17:8; John 11:25.</li>
		<li>The budding rod is the issue of the enjoyment of the hidden manna; thus, the more we enjoy the hidden Christ, the more we will experience the budding, blossoming, and fruit-bearing of the resurrected Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The tablets of the covenant signify our experience of Christ as the inner law of life, which infuses the divine nature and attributes into our being, conforms us to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and makes us the corporate reproduction of Christ, the standard model&mdash; Heb. 9:4e; 8:10; Rom. 8:2, 29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ has passed through a process to enter into His perfection and glorification, and now, as the law of life, He is repeating this process within us, bringing us into His perfection and glorification&mdash;Heb. 2:10.</li>
		<li>As the law of life works Christ into every part of our being, causing Christ to be formed in us, God is wrought into man, man is mingled with God, and God and man become one entity&mdash;this is the most secret mystery in the whole universe&mdash;Gal. 4:19; John 14:20; 17:21-24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>At the golden incense altar, we participate in the interceding life of Christ as the center of the divine administration&mdash;Heb. 9:4a; Exo. 30:1-10; Rev. 8:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The writer of Hebrews regarded the incense altar, which is related to prayer, as belonging to the Holy of Holies&mdash;Heb. 9:3-4; 1 Kings 6:22; Luke 1:10-11.</li>
	<li>The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people&mdash;Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The incense altar is a type of the person of Christ.</li>
		<li>It signifies Christ praying, Christ interceding&mdash;John 17:1-26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to enjoy Christ not only as the table, the lampstand, and the ark but also as the incense altar:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As a divine motor, the incense altar is the place from which the activities in all other places in the tabernacle and the outer court are motivated.</li>
		<li>If we do not have the incense altar, none of the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court will be effective in our experience.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s interceding life, His prayer life, is the center of the divine administration&mdash;Rev. 8:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The executing center of Gods&rsquo; administration is the incense altar, not the ark.</li>
		<li>The prayer life of Christ is the center&mdash;the heavenly White House&mdash;of God&rsquo;s execution of His government on earth.</li>
		<li>The prayer offered at the incense altar governs the whole universe.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>After His resurrection and ascension, the individual Christ became the corporate Christ; thus, before God today not only is the individual Christ interceding, but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, the Head with the Body, is also interceding to carry out His intercession&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12; Acts 12:5, 12; Rom. 8:26-27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we have this view of the incense altar, our prayer life will be revolutionized, and we will pray for the executing of God&rsquo;s purpose, for the carrying out of the divine administration, and for the dispensing of God&rsquo;s supplying grace.</li>
		<li>This kind of prayer fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose, satisfies His hunger, and delights His heart.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The will of God is to have Christ as the replacement for all the offerings in the Old Testament so that we may enjoy Him as everything in living and practicing the Body life for the building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9-11; Heb. 10:7-10; Rom. 12:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s replacing of all the Old Testament offerings, taking away all the Old Testament types and establishing Himself as everything to us, is God&rsquo;s great will:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Old Testament predicted in Isaiah 53 that Christ would come to be the sacrifice for sin, that is, to replace and terminate the Levitical sacrifices&mdash;vv. 6, 11-12.</li>
		<li>God prepared a body for Christ so that He could offer Himself to God to replace all the offerings&mdash;Heb. 10:5.</li>
		<li>Christ took away &ldquo;the first,&rdquo; the sacrifices of the old covenant, that He might establish Himself as &ldquo;the second,&rdquo; the sacrifice of the new covenant&mdash;v. 9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As &ldquo;the second&rdquo; Christ is everything&mdash;v. 9.</li>
			<li>By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of Christ&rsquo;s body once for all so that we may enjoy and partake of Him as our everything&mdash;v. 10.</li>

	<li>The will of God today is simply for us to enjoy Christ so that we may become the corporate reproduction of Himself through His organic salvation&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; 1 Thes. 5:16-18; Rom. 5:10; 8:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to enjoy Christ as the tabernacle, the enterable God, and as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament so that He may become our genuineness and sincerity for us to worship God with the worship that He seeks&mdash;John 1:14; 4:23-24; 14:17a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings is the reality and content of the universe:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ, the incarnate God, came as the embodiment of God, as illustrated by the tabernacle, so that man could contact Him and enter into Him to enjoy the riches contained in God.</li>
		<li>Christ as the embodiment of God brought God to man to make God contactable, touchable, receivable, experienceable, enterable, and enjoyable.</li>
		<li>Christ who was incarnated to be the living tabernacle is also the Lamb of God, the aggregate, the totality, of all the offerings&mdash; John 1:14, 29.</li>
		<li>As the tabernacle Christ is the enterable God, the mutual abode of God and man, and as the offerings He is the way for us to enter into God&mdash;14:6a.</li>
		<li>Christ as the tabernacle brings God to man, and Christ as the offerings brings man to God so that man may be united, mingled, and incorporated with God.</li>
		<li>The tabernacle is good for us to experience, enter into, and join to God, and the offerings are good for us to enjoy God and mingle with God.</li>
		<li>The offerings are presents to God by the appreciators of Christ for their intimate fellowship with Him&mdash;Lev. 1:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We daily need to practice taking and applying Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering, which will usher us into the enjoyment of Christ as the burnt offering and the meal offering, consummating in our enjoyment of Him as the peace offering plus the wave offering, heave offering, and drink offering:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sin offering signifies that Christ was made sin for us that through His death on the cross, sin might be condemned&mdash;Lev. 4:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3; John 1:29; 3:14.</li>
		<li>The trespass offering signifies that Christ bore our sins in His own body and was judged by God on the cross to deal with our sinful deeds that we might be forgiven in our sinful conduct&mdash;Lev. 5:6; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Isa. 53:5-6, 10-11; John 4:15-18.</li>
		<li>The burnt offering, which was wholly for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, signifies Christ as God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction, as the One whose living on earth was absolutely for God&mdash;Lev. 1:3; Num. 28:2-3; John 7:16-18.</li>
		<li>The meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity and in His human living, which was proper, even, tender, fine, balanced, pure, and sinless&mdash;Lev. 2:1, 4; John 7:46; 18:38; 19:4, 6.</li>
		<li>The peace offering signifies Christ as the Peacemaker, the One who became the peace and the fellowship between God and us by shedding His blood and dying for us, enabling us to enjoy Christ with God and to have fellowship with God in Christ for our mutual satisfaction with God&mdash;Lev. 3:1; Eph. 2:14-15; John 12:1-3; 20:21; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		<li>The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ in love&mdash;Lev. 7:30; 10:15.</li>
		<li>The heave offering signifies the powerful Christ in ascension and exaltation&mdash;Lev. 7:32; Exo. 29:27; Eph. 1:21.</li>
		<li>The drink offering signifies Christ as the enjoyment of the offerer, enabling the offerer to be filled with Christ as the heavenly wine and even to become the wine offered to God for His enjoyment and satisfaction&mdash;Exo. 29:40; Num. 28:7-10; Isa. 53:12; Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6; Judg. 9:13.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We need to look away unto Jesus with undivided attention by turning away from every other object&mdash;Heb. 12:1-2; S. S. 1:4; Psa. 27:4.</li>
<li>Jesus is the Author of faith, the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith&mdash;Heb. 12:2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith&mdash;Rom. 3:22 and note 1; Gal. 2:16 and note 1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our believing is our appreciation of Christ as a reaction to His attraction&mdash;Rom. 10:17.</li>
		<li>In our natural man we have no believing ability; we do not have faith by ourselves.</li>
		<li>The faith by which we are saved is the precious faith that we have received from the Lord, the God-allotted faith&mdash;2 Pet. 1:1; Col. 1:12.</li>
		<li>When we look away unto Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) transfuses us with Himself, His believing element.</li>
		<li>This faith is not of ourselves but of Him who imparts Himself as the believing element into us that He may believe for us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith is a substantiating ability, a sixth sense, the sense by which we substantiate, give substance to, the things unseen or hoped for&mdash;Heb. 11:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Substantiating is the ability which enables us to realize a substance.</li>
		<li>The function of our five senses is to substantiate the things of the outside world, transferring all the objective items into us to become our subjective experience.</li>
		<li>As the eye is to seeing, the ear to hearing, and the nose to smelling, so faith, our spirit of faith, is the organ whereby we substantiate everything in the unseen spiritual world into us&mdash;2 Cor. 4:13:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We must exercise our spirit of faith, our mingled spirit, to believe and to speak the things we have experienced of the Lord.</li>
			<li>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind; doubts are in our mind.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We do not regard, look at, the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal&mdash;2 Cor. 4:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Christian life is a life of things unseen&mdash;Rom. 8:24-25; Heb. 11:27; 1 Pet. 1:8; Gal. 6:10.</li>
			<li>The degradation of the church is the degradation from unseen things to seen things.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover His church from things seen to things unseen.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Faith assures us of the things not seen, convincing us of what we do not see; therefore, it is the evidence, the proof, of things unseen.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith is to believe that God is:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Without faith it is impossible to please God, to make God happy&mdash;Heb. 11:6a.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;He who comes forward to God must believe that He is&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 11:6b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To believe that God is, is to believe that He is everything to us and that we are nothing&mdash;John 8:58; Eccl.1:2.</li>
			<li>To believe that God is implies that we are not; He must be the only One, the unique One, in everything, and we must be nothing in everything&mdash;Heb. 11:5.</li>
			<li>To believe that God is, is to deny our self; in the whole universe He is, and all of us are nothing&mdash;Luke 9:23.</li>
			<li>I should not be anything; I should not exist; only He should exist&mdash;&ldquo;It is no longer I, but Christ&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
			<li>At his conversion the Lord told Saul of Tarsus, &ldquo;I am Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 9:5:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The Lord was saying, &ldquo;I am the great I Am. I am the One that is. You must believe that I am and you are not.&rdquo;</li>
				<li>2) Eventually, Saul was over, and Paul came up&mdash;Acts 13:9.</li>

	<li>When we look away unto Him, He ministers heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, that we may be able to run the heavenly race and live the heavenly life on earth&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>We all have the same faith in quality, but the quantity of faith we have depends upon how much we contact the living God so that we may have Him increased in us&mdash;Rom. 12:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith in the progressing stage comes through our contacting the Triune God, who is faith in us&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17.</li>
		<li>The way to receive such a faith is to contact its source, the Lord, the processed and consummated God, by calling on Him, praying to Him, and pray-reading His word&mdash;Heb. 4:16; Rom. 10:12; 2 Tim. 2:22; Eph. 6:17-18; Heb. 4:2.</li>
		<li>When we contact Him, He is overflowing within us, and there is a mutuality of faith among us; we are encouraged through the faith which is in one another&mdash;Rom. 1:12; Philem. 6.</li>

<li>Abraham, Moses, and the martyrs are part of the history of faith and witnesses to the unique way of faith&mdash;Heb. 11:8-19, 23-27, 32-38:

	<li>By faith the martyrs experienced God&rsquo;s peaceful silence, exercising faith in God even when He did nothing to deliver them&mdash;Heb. 11:32-38; Matt. 11:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Faith is the unique way to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The believers in Christ are justified by faith, and have life and live by faith&mdash;Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By faith, which is the moving and working God in Christ who puts us into Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30), we have the divine life according to God&rsquo;s righteousness judicially.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;The righteous shall have life and live by faith&rdquo; (Rom. 1:17); &ldquo;This word should be the banner of God&rsquo;s eternal economy, which is altogether a matter in faith (1 Tim. 1:4)!&rdquo; (<em>The Crystallization of the Epistle to the Romans,</em> pp. 123-124).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are brought into an organic union with Christ&mdash;Gal. 2:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Faith in Jesus Christ</em> denotes an organic union with Christ through believing:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is related to our experience of Christ as the most precious One, who is infused into us and who becomes in us the faith by which we believe into Him.</li>
			<li>Faith creates an organic union, a life union, in which we and Christ are one&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In this organic union we experience Christ and live Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:17; John 14:17; Gal. 2:20; 2 Cor. 5:7:

			<li>The real experience of Christ is invisible; it is altogether a matter of faith&mdash;Heb. 11:1; Eph. 3:17.</li>
			<li>We should not put our trust in anything extraordinary or spectacular; instead, we should take the way of faith, which is to read the Word and believe it&mdash;Rom. 10:8, 17.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>In the Body &ldquo;God has apportioned to each a measure of faith&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 12:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God first allotted faith to us in quality (2 Pet. 1:1), and then He apportioned it in quantity.</li>
		<li>How much faith we have depends upon God&rsquo;s apportioning.</li>
		<li>We should esteem ourselves according to the faith that God has apportioned to us, that is, according to the measure of God&rsquo;s element that has been infused into us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Faith is the divine requirement for the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return and to receive the reward of the kingdom&mdash;Luke 18:8; Heb. 10:35, 39:

	<li>As the many brothers of Christ, we are the same as the firstborn Son; He is divine and human, and we are human and divine&mdash;Heb. 2:11; 1:6; Rom. 8:29.</li>
	<li>The church is an organism with two lives and two natures combined and mingled together&mdash; Lev. 2:1-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is altogether a matter of life&mdash; the divine life and the uplifted, resurrected human life&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>The church has two natures&mdash;the human nature and the divine nature; therefore, the church is both human and divine&mdash;Heb. 2:14, 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church the firstborn Son of God declares the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers, and in the midst of the church the firstborn Son of God sings hymns of praise unto the Father&mdash;Heb. 2:12; Psa. 22:22; cf. Matt. 26:30.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church is a corporate partnership with Christ&mdash;Heb. 3:14; 1:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The goal of God&rsquo;s operation in the universe is to accomplish a glorious expression of Himself&mdash; Heb. 2:10; John 17:1, 5, 22, 24; Rev. 21:10-11.</li>
	<li>In His exaltation the Lord Jesus was inaugurated as Lord and Christ to administrate God&rsquo;s operation, and He was also designated as the legal Heir to inherit all things in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Acts 2:36; Heb. 1:2.</li>
	<li>The firstborn Son is God&rsquo;s appointed Heir, and we, the many sons, have been saved to be His joint-heirs, inheriting not only salvation but all things with Him&mdash;Heb. 1:14; Rom. 8:17; Gal. 4:7; Eph. 3:6; Titus 3:7.</li>
	<li>Since Christ as the firstborn Son of God is God&rsquo;s appointed Heir and we as the many sons of God are His joint-heirs, we are Christ&rsquo;s partners&mdash; Heb. 1:9; 3:14:

	<li>As the house of God, the church is the real Bethel, the gate of heaven, where the firstborn Son of God is the heavenly ladder&mdash;Gen. 28:10-22; John 1:51.</li>
	<li>The Father&rsquo;s house is a divine and human incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect&mdash;John 14:2, 20.</li>
	<li>The indwelling Christ is building Himself into us and building us into Him to produce a mutual abode&mdash;Eph. 3:17; John 14:2-3, 23; 2 Sam. 7:12-14a.</li>

<li>The church, the enlargement of Christ, is the Sabbath rest&mdash;John 2:19, 21; 3:29a, 30; 1 Cor. 12:12; Heb. 3:6; 4:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The individual Christ is God&rsquo;s Sabbath (Matt. 11:28-29), and the church is the enlargement of Christ; therefore, the church is also God&rsquo;s Sabbath rest.</li>
	<li>The church is God&rsquo;s satisfaction and rest because in the church God has His habitation for His expression and representation&mdash;Eph. 2:22.</li>
	<li>There is only one situation that can satisfy God&mdash;a situation in which God has gained a group of people to be His expression and representation&mdash;Heb. 2:12; 3:6, 14.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">

<li>The church is the unshakable kingdom of God&mdash;Heb. 12:28:

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom is actually the Lord Himself as the kingdom within us&mdash;Luke 17:20-21; Mark 4:3, 26.</li>
		<li>Whereas the church is Christ&rsquo;s increase in life, the kingdom is Christ&rsquo;s increase in administration.</li>
		<li>In the coming age the corporate Christ, Christ with His overcomers, will become a great mountain to fill the earth, making the whole earth God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;Dan. 2:35, 44.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church we are living in the kingdom of God today&mdash;John 3:3, 5; Rom. 14:17; Rev. 1:9.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The church is God&rsquo;s flock under the all-inclusive, tender care of Christ as the great Shepherd of the sheep&mdash;Heb. 13:20-21; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:2:

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Christian life is a race, and we must run this race to receive the prize, the incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award to His overcoming saints who win the race&mdash;Heb. 12:1; 1 Cor. 9:24-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the saved Christians must run the race to win the prize (1 Cor. 9:24), which is not salvation in the common sense (Eph. 2:8; 1 Cor. 3:15) but a reward in a special sense (Heb. 10:35; 1 Cor. 3:14).</li>
	<li>The apostle Paul ran the race, finished his course, and won the prize, the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord will also reward all those who have loved His appearing&mdash;1 Cor. 9:26-27; Phil. 3:12-14; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim. 4:7-8.</li>
	<li>As His believers, we have all received salvation and eternal life through faith in Christ, and we will not suffer eternal perdition (John 3:16, 36; 10:28-29), but our being rewarded by Him and escaping dispensational punishment depends on how we run the race&mdash;Matt. 25:30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to subdue our body and make it a conquered captive to serve us as a slave for fulfilling our holy purpose&mdash;1 Cor. 9:27; Col. 3:5; Rom. 8:13.</li>
		<li>We must be very much on the alert to run our course so that we might not be disapproved and rejected at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and be found unworthy of the reward of the coming kingdom&mdash;Matt. 24:42-46; Mark 13:33-37; Luke 12:37; Matt. 7:21-23; 25:11-12.</li>
		<li>We must pursue toward the goal, the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ, for the prize, the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race&mdash;Phil. 3:12-14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, we need to forget the past, not even lingering in our past experiences of Christ.</li>
			<li>Lingering in our past experiences, however genuine they are, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ.</li>
			<li>We must stretch forward day by day to gain more of the vast unexplored territory of the Christ before us.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We must be the wise virgins, redeeming the time to be filled with the Spirit, and the faithful slaves, using the Lord&rsquo;s gift to the fullest extent, so that we can participate in the Lord&rsquo;s joy in the coming kingdom&mdash;Matt. 25:2-4, 22-23.</li>
		<li>To remain in the Holy of Holies, our spirit, is to continue the running of the race&mdash;Acts 17:16; 19:21; 20:22; Rom. 1:9; 2 Cor. 2:13:

			<li>The more we run, the larger the Holy of Holies becomes, expanding from the tabernacle to the temple and ultimately to the New Jerusalem&mdash;Exo. 26:8, 16; 1 Kings 6:20.</li>
			<li>Eventually, the entire New Jerusalem will be the enlarged Holy of Holies&mdash;Rev. 21:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We must live in the reality of the kingdom today (Matt. 5&mdash;7) so that we can be rewarded with manifestation of the kingdom at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (Matt. 24&mdash;25):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand&mdash;Matt. 5:48; Luke 6:35.</li>
			<li>To live in the reality of the kingdom, we must exercise to be poor in spirit, to be pure in heart, and to have the righteousness which exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees&mdash;Matt. 5:3, 8, 20.</li>
			<li>To live in the reality of the kingdom, we must forgive others (Matt. 18:21-22, 35; Eph. 4:32; 5:2) and seek forgiveness from others (Matt. 5:23-24).</li>
			<li>We need to live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must take grace to finish our course for the kingdom reward&mdash;Heb. 12:28, 15; 13:25:

	<li>To realize and participate in all the things unveiled in Hebrews, we need grace:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To take grace, to have grace, we must come forward to the throne of grace that we may find grace for timely help&mdash;Heb. 4:16.</li>
		<li>When we touch the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies through the exercise of our spirit, we enjoy the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29) and our heart is confirmed by grace (13:9):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The grace of God in His economy is rich, multiplying, and abounding&mdash;Eph. 2:7; 1 Pet. 1:2b; 2 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:6-8.</li>

			<li>We can receive grace by loving the Lord in incorruptibility&mdash;Eph. 6:24.</li>

			<li>We can enjoy the word of His grace&mdash;Acts 20:32; Jer. 15:16.</li>
			<li>We can enjoy the grace of life, typified by the descending dew of Hermon on the mountains of Zion, in the church life on the genuine ground of oneness&mdash;Psa. 133.</li>
			<li>Our experience of the processed Triune God as grace enables us to be good stewards of the varied grace of God, those who are one with our great High Priest in His heavenly ministering of the processed God into people for their enjoyment&mdash; 1 Pet. 4:10; Heb. 7:1; Gen. 14:18-20.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By such an enjoyment of grace, we run the race set before us (Heb. 12:1) that we may reach the goal of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>

<h1 class="title">Enter within the Veil and Go outside the Camp</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 6:19-20; 13:13; Exo. 33:7-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The goal and ultimate conclusion of the book of Hebrews is that we would enter within the veil and go outside the camp&mdash;Heb. 6:19-20; 13:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To enter within the veil means to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp means to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast in rejection:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The camp signifies the organization of religion, which is earthly and human.</li>
		<li>Every religion is a human organization and an earthly realm which keeps people away from God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must be in our spirit, where, experientially speaking, the practical Holy of Holies is today, and outside religion, where the practical camp is today:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more we are in our spirit, enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we will come outside the camp of religion, following the suffering Jesus.</li>
		<li>The more we remain in our spirit to contact the heavenly Christ, who is in glory, the more we will go forth outside the camp of religion unto the lowly Jesus to suffer with Him.</li>
		<li>The genuine New Testament ministry brings us into the enjoyment of Christ in our spirit, within the veil, and strengthens us to follow Jesus outside the camp in the fellowship of His sufferings for the sake of His Body&mdash; 2 Cor. 11:2-3, 23-33:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Within the veil, we participate in the ministry of the heavenly Christ that we may be equipped to minister Him to the thirsty spirits outside the camp.</li>
			<li>By entering within the veil and going outside the camp, we are equipped in every good work for the doing of the will of God, who does in us that which is well pleasing in His sight&mdash;Heb. 13:20-21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To enter within the veil is to get into our spirit; when we turn to our spirit and exercise it, we enter within the veil&mdash;1 Tim. 4:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have to exercise, to use, to employ, our spirit by fanning our spirit into flame, setting our mind on the spirit, and discerning our spirit from our soul&mdash;2 Tim. 1:6-7; Rom. 8:5-6; Heb. 4:12.</li>
		<li>We must exercise our spirit that we may enter within the veil to have direct contact with the heavenly Christ, the man in the glory, beholding Him to be transfused and infused with Him so that we may become His corporate reproduction&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>To be within the veil is to be in the Holy of Holies, in a realm where we partake of Christ and enjoy Him as the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life, issuing in God&rsquo;s corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose&mdash;Heb. 9:3-4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>After the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, Moses moved to a place outside the camp, where everyone who sought the Lord went to meet with him, for both the Lord&rsquo;s presence and speaking were there&mdash; Exo. 33:7-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to see and be warned by the principle of the golden-calf idol, an idol made by God&rsquo;s redeemed people to make them an idolatrous camp&mdash;1 Cor. 10:5-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Self-beautification leads to idolatry&mdash;Exo. 32:1-3; 33:5-6; Gen. 35:2-4; cf. Exo. 28:2; Isa. 60:21.</li>
		<li>Idolatry is Satan&rsquo;s usurping of what God has given us in order to make it a waste; it is our abusing what God has given us and not using God&rsquo;s gifts, both material and spiritual, for God&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
		<li>Idolatry is the worship of the things we enjoy, the worship of enjoyment, amusement, and entertainment&mdash;Exo. 32:6, 18-19; cf. Psa. 36:8-9.</li>
		<li>With idolatry there is the pretense of worshipping the true God&mdash;Exo. 32:4-6; 1 Kings 12:26-30.</li>
		<li>With idolatry there is mixture in worship&mdash; Exo. 32:4-6, 21-24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because Moses realized that the Lord&rsquo;s presence would no longer be in the midst of the people, he removed his tent and pitched it afar off from the camp; his tent then became the tent of God&mdash;Exo. 33:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The camp signifies a religious people, who belong to the Lord in name but who, in actuality, worship idols, worshipping something and seeking something other than the Lord Himself:</li>
		<li>In the history of God&rsquo;s people, the camp may be seen in at least three periods:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The camp was first the children of Israel after they worshipped the golden calf.</li>
			<li>The Jewish religion became the camp at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s living on the earth&mdash;Matt. 15:7-9.</li>
			<li>Later, the church changed in nature from being a tent to being a camp, a religious system, religious Babylon, comprising a group of religious people belonging to the Lord in name and honoring the Lord with their mouth, but having their hearts set on something other than the Lord&mdash; Gen. 11:4, 7, 9; 2 Chron. 36:6-7; Ezra 1:11; Rev. 17:3-5; 18:2a, 4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>After Moses removed his tent and separated it from the idolatrous camp, the Lord spoke to him face to face, as a man speaks to his companion&mdash;Exo. 33:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God and Moses were companions, associates, partners, involved in the same career and having a common interest in a great enterprise.</li>
			<li>Because Moses was intimate with God, he was a person who knew God&rsquo;s heart, who was according to God&rsquo;s heart, and who could touch God&rsquo;s heart.</li>
			<li>We need to enter within the veil and go outside the idolatrous camp to have the closest and most intimate relationship with the Lord so that we can be persons who share a common interest with God and who can be used by Him to carry out His enterprise on earth.</li>
