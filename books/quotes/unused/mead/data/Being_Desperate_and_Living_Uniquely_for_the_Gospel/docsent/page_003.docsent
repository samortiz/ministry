   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In October they had the saints sign up to be on a team and to make a definite consecration to give two hours each week for the door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Over half of the church signed up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ratio was exactly two sisters to each brother for groups of three saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They assigned the saints to specific teams and assigned the teams to specific areas in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each team, composed of two door-knocking groups, was charged to go out on a weekly basis to follow strict procedures of the new way and to keep detailed records of their activities for statistical purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brother pointed out in his letter that although the outward practices have to be preceded by the inward filling of the Spirit, it seems that the Lord will bless the outward practices of the new way if they are strictly applied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that in their experience, the stricter the practice was, the greater the anointing was.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The difference they experienced when they turned from the loose way to the strict way was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The saints were once again stirred and motivated about the door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The anointing was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Homes were being opened, and people were being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though the saints in this locality were all involved in the winter training this year in Irving, some of the teams were still going out, and ten were baptized during the training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One team went out one day during the training, and six were baptized in less than an hour and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the training, more saints were stirred up to go out for the door-knocking, and now about seventy percent of the saints in this small church of about sixty saints have signed up for the one in four trained door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One of the full-timers there returned from Taipei in December, and now with him they will have an intensive weekend door-knocking training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The leading brother in this local church wanted me to know that they were very burdened to stand with me in prayer for the success of steps two, three, and four in Taipei: knowing the truth and teaching the truth to the new converts in their homes; growing in life to minister life; and having the practice of the church life in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This church registered six for the full-time training in Taipei this spring, leaving two full-timers there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That makes eight full-timers out of a church of sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In May, four more of their saints will be graduating, and they also plan to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They and many others of the students there are consumed with the desire to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also received another letter from a couple who returned to another locality from the full-time training in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They began to go out each evening to knock on doors with the saints there and were encouraged with the saints' eagerness to come with them to learn how the training taught them to knock on doors and to enter into the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A leading brother in this locality who went with this couple to knock on doors one evening, baptized a friend of his son in the new way in his home the following day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This brother testified that if he had not gone out to knock on doors, this would not have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now this brother is "catching on fire" and wants to grasp every opportunity to go out with this couple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They began to visit the apartments surrounding the meeting hall and of the one hundred and one doors knocked on in four evenings, sixty doors opened, and seventeen of these were entered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of the twenty-five people they contacted, nine were genuine sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eleven prayed and received the Lord, and they had one glorious baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This newly baptized sister was so happy that she did not have to "go to church" to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Her words were, "That's great!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Afterward, she expressed how grateful she was that the saints came, and she wanted to know whose idea it was to visit people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They told her that it was the Lord's idea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They now have a total of eleven homes that are open to them to revisit for a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This couple testified that they love the new way and that the new way is satisfying, reviving, encouraging, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It has brought them the experience of joy unspeakable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Up to the last week of the training in Taipei, the full timers there had baptized only a little over six thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They felt this number was not up to the standard, so within the last week of the training they got close to one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They baptized such a large number within one week because they became desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Two heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses, also knock on doors, but we do not follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have enjoyed and still enjoy going to visit people by knocking on their doors, you know there is a big difference.</S>
