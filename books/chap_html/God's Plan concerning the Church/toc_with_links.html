<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages and fellowship given by Brother Witness Lee. Chapters 1 through 3 are messages given at an unknown time and place. Chapters 4 and 5 contain key points of fellowship with different groups of people not meeting on the ground of the church. This fellowship was given in Taipei in April 1957. Portions of this fellowship are in chapter 2 of <em>The Ground of the Church and the Service of the Body.</em> These chapters were originally published in 1957 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p>
