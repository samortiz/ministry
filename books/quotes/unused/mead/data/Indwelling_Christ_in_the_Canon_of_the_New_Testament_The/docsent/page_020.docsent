   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 17; 6:3-6a; 8:1, 2, 9-11, 16, 23; 12:5-6 GOSPELS, ACTS, EPISTLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospels show us how Christ became a man that we could be put into Him, and how He became the Spirit so that He could come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, we have been put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then secondly, He comes into us and lives within.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the main aspect of the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this, the Acts show us a group of people who have been baptized into the Triune God, and now He is indwelling them as their life and they become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So Acts, strictly speaking, is not a book of preaching, work or ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a record of a corporate people who have been put into the Triune God, and who have the Triune God living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are such an extraordinary kind of human being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are a kind that are mingled with God by being in God and having God living in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts is not a book of activities, but a biography of such an extraordinary kind of being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Acts, there are the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We really must thank the Lord for the arrangement of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is firstly the Gospels, then the Acts, and then the Epistle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To understand the indwelling Christ, we need two things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need the vision and we need the experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The experiences always come out of the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The four Gospels and the Acts give us the vision, and the Epistles tell us how to experience the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE WAY TO THE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The book of Romans is considered by most Christians to be a book of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A great section in this book covers the matter of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we all must realize that justification by faith is not the ultimate goal of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ultimate goal is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The beginning of the book speaks of justification by faith, but at the end, the book reaches the final goal of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Between these two ends, we have the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans starts with justification by faith and ends with the Body of Christ, but the central section speaks of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have only seen justification by faith, we have only seen the first part of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We appreciate the fact that the Lord used Martin Luther to recover the matter of justification by faith, but that is just the beginning of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to go on to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The goal is the Body of Christ, and the way from justification by faith to the Body of Christ is the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we can see that the indwelling of Christ is quite crucial and strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would reach God s goal from God s start, we must take God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This way is the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>RECONCILED TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to see some of the more important verses on the indwelling of Christ in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first is Romans 5:10, For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse covers two main points.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first is that when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We were not only sinners in the eyes of God, but also enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were God s enemies, but, Hallelujah, we were reconciled!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we were only sinners we would only need forgiveness, but as enemies we needed reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that we have not only been forgiven, but also reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We were reconciled to God by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the ultimate consummation of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are no more problems between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Isn t this wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the problems have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been reconciled to God by the redeeming death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>MUCH MORE SAVED BY HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this verse covers something more.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And it is not only something more, but much more.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Much more we shall be saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have been reconciled, yet we still need some saving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you sure that you have been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you have been saved, why does this verse say that we shall be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Well, on one hand, we have been saved from God s condemnation, and we have been reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise the Lord, we have been saved!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But on the other hand there are still many negative things in our lives from which we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am afraid that as a wife you are not so happy with your husband, and as a husband, you are not so much at peace with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I don t know what it is, but I am sure that it is something that you need to be saved from.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, we all have our temper and all our shortcomings from which we must be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The flesh, the old man, the self, the natural life all need a daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have been saved from so many things, yet we still need to be saved from more things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So, being reconciled, much more shall we be saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This saving is not by His death, but by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here we must consider something.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If Christ does not live within us, if He does not indwell us, how could we be saved by His life?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If He is just in heaven sitting at the right hand of God, how could we be saved by His life?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But, Hallelujah, Christ today is not only sitting at the right hand of God Rom 8:34 , but also moving within us Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As He lives within us, we can enjoy His saving life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And the life of Jesus is simply Jesus Himself living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not consider that the life of Jesus is one thing, and Jesus Himself is another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The life of Jesus is Jesus Himself living within us.</S>
