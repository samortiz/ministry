   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PURE REVELATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Scriptures unfold two aspects of the revelation of the Triune God the aspect of the Three being one and the aspect of the One being three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As examples of these two aspects, we may cite John 1:1 and 2 Corinthians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 1:1 says, "The Word was with God," and it also says, "The Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the statement, "The Word was with God," the Word and God are two distinct entities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the declaration, "The Word was God," clearly indicates that the Word and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are they two or one?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a mystery which we cannot clearly explain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit," and it also speaks of "the Spirit of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The Lord is the Spirit" tells us that the Lord and the Spirit are one, but the title, "the Spirit of the Lord," indicates that the Lord and the Spirit are two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are the Lord and the Spirit two or one?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot answer adequately or thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>69 However, since these Scriptures testify both aspects of God, we must accept them as such without attempting to reconcile or systematize them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we refuse to be simple and say, "Amen," to all that the Scriptures have spoken, but rather try to reconcile apparently conflicting statements, we shall find ourselves in a theological maze.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One Unique God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible clearly and definitely reveals that God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With this there can be no argument, for it is revealed plainly in both the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Deuteronomy 6:4 says, "Hear, O Israel, Jehovah is our God; Jehovah is one," and Isaiah 44:6 declares, "Thus says Jehovah the King of Israel, I am the First and I am the Last, and apart from Me there is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Isaiah 44:8, the Lord asks a question and then answers it Himself: "Is there a God besides Me?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or is there any other Rock?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not know of any."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Coming to the New Testament, we see that 1 Corinthians 8:4 says, "There is no God but one"; that Romans 3:30 says, "If indeed God is one, who will justify the circumcision out of faith"; that Galatians 3:20 says, "God is one"; and that 1 Timothy 2:5 says, "There is one God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, it is abundantly clear that according to the revelation of the pure Word of God, God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever else we may say about Him must be governed by this fundamental principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Three Persons of the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To use Govett's words, while the Bible reveals that there is only one God, "the Scripture as plainly affirms the distinction of persons in the Godhead."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>70 In Isaiah 6:8 God says, "Whom shall I send?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who will go for Us?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here, on the one hand God speaks of Himself as "I," and on the other hand as "Us."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This proves that "I" is "Us" and that "Us" is "I."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then, is God singular or plural?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis 1:26 God also speaks of Himself as "Us."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His divine words, the one unique God frequently speaks of Himself as "Us."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This must be due to the three Persons of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>71</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew 28:19 says, "Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we clearly see the three Persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, although the Father, Son, and Spirit are three, the name is one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This name tells us that God is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although God is uniquely one, there is still the matter of the three Persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To quote Griffith Thomas:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The threefold distinction in God, which is expressed by the word Trinity,' is the attempt of man to conceive and express the meaning of the Infinite God in the terms of Jesus Christ, and we believe that the use of the phrase, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,' is the very best rendering of the mystery that can be given.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>72</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Trinity of the Godhead is revealed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is even implied in Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Hebrew language, the subject "God" is triple in number, whereas the verb "create" is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This contains the meaning that God is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Exodus 3:6 the Lord said to Moses, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This passage reveals that the God of the patriarchs is threefold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With the God of Abraham, the emphasis is on the Father; with the God of Isaac, the emphasis is on the Son; and with the God of Jacob, the emphasis is on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>73 Although God is uniquely one, there is still the matter of threefoldness, for He is the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Trinity of the Godhead is also implied in the threefold blessing in Numbers 6:24-26 and in the threefold praise to God in Isaiah 6:3.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Undoubtedly, the reason the seraphim in heaven say, "Holy, holy, holy," is that the God whom they praise is one-in-three.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Isaiah 6:3 is taken with verse 8 of the same chapter, we see that this God whom the seraphim praise speaks of Himself as "Us," indicating that, according to the context, He has a threefold Person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>74</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition to Matthew 28:19, numerous passages in the New Testament clearly reveal that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First Peter 1:2 says, "Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here the three divine Persons, the Father, Spirit, and Son, are mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The same is true of Revelation 1:4-5, where the apostle John says, "Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>" This passage clearly reveals that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, according to the pure word of the Bible, God is uniquely one, and this unique God is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
