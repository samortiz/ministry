<h1 class="title">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO ENJOY THE LORD<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 5:1a, 2a; 1:23; 2:2, 5a; Eph. 5:18b-22; 6:17-18; 2 Tim. 1:7; 2:1, 22; 3:16; 4:22; Gal. 6:18</h1>
<p>We have seen the matter of eating from the Gospels and from the Epistles. What we have seen was written mostly either by John or by Paul. Now we want to see something written by Peter to show how consistent the New Testament is in the concept of eating the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEEDING THE LAMBS</h2>
<p>When Peter was young, he was charged by the Lord to feed the Lord&rsquo;s lambs and sheep (John 21:15, 17). When Peter became old, he did not forget this. Thus, in his first Epistle, he charged the elders to shepherd, or to feed, the flock of God (5:2). Peter, just as John and Paul, realized that for the building up of the church there is the need of the growth in life. For the growth in life, there is the need of feeding and eating.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING REGENERATED BY THE WORD AS A SEED</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 1, Peter says that we were born again by the word as the seed (v. 23). Many consider the word in the Bible as doctrines. But here Peter says that the living word of God should be considered as a seed. This seed does not convey knowledge but imparts life into you. The word of God is not mere doctrines. When the word of God, not the word in letters, the dead words, but the living word with the Spirit, gets into you, it imparts life into you, so you are born again.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRINKING THE MILK OF THE WORD<br />
IN ORDER THAT BY IT WE MAY GROW<br />
TO BE LIVING STONES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>As one who is born again, you need to grow. For the growth you surely need to eat something. You need the nourishment. If there is no nutrition, there is no growth. Thus, Peter says in 1 Peter 2 that as newborn babes, we need to long for the milk of the word in order that we may grow (v. 2). From God&rsquo;s word there is the nourishment. As newborn babes you have to take in this nourishing milk in order that you may grow. Our growth is not to be big spiritual giants but to be living stones, and the living stones are for the building up of the spiritual house of God (v. 5).</p>
<p>I hope we all can see that there is such a consistent concept about God&rsquo;s building, and this concept is that for God&rsquo;s building we all need to eat. We need to receive the nourishment, not the knowledge. We all have to remember the words spoken by Paul. Knowledge does not build up (1 Cor. 8:1), but nourishment from eating builds up (3:2, 6, 9). Never forget this. There is a wrong concept among Christians today. They either consider teaching as the building element, or they pay much attention to the gifts. But if you have a clear vision of God&rsquo;s divine concept, you can see that the real building of God&rsquo;s house is not by teaching or by gifts but by nourishment. The only way to get the Lord as your spiritual nourishment is by eating and drinking the Lord, and by this nourishment you grow to be living stones.</p>
<p>Peter was a simple fisherman. His level of education, no doubt, was not high. But God frequently chooses simple persons. D. L. Moody was a shoe salesman when he was saved, yet he became a great evangelist. God uses such persons, who give you the important points without any kind of knowledge. Peter was so simple, telling us to be as newborn babes who long for the milk of the word, that by it we may grow to be the living stones for God&rsquo;s spiritual house.</p>
<p>Nothing is so simple as eating. The mothers know that there is nearly no need for them to teach their children to eat. Every little babe, after being delivered, starts to eat. Without any teaching, the little babe knows how to eat. The eating function is from birth. There is no need for you to grow up in order to have the function of eating. Other functions, such as seeing and hearing, require growth. Only the eating function does not need the growth. After you were born, you immediately started to eat. This is something of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO BE RESCUED FROM THE SYSTEM OF ERROR</h2>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of the building up of the church, we have to be rescued from our old concept. Satan is subtle to such an extent that he uses the good things, even the best things, to systematize us. Ephesians 4:14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; Some errors, some mistakes, are systematized. This means that Satan uses the doctrines to form a system. Every good doctrine eventually becomes a part of Satan&rsquo;s system. Satan systematizes people. In other words, Satan puts them into a system.</p>
<p>This may be likened to a big university that has many schools. If your interest is in mathematics, the university puts you into the school of mathematics. If your interest is in psychology, the university puts you into the major of psychology. If your interest is in social things, the university puts you into the major of sociology. A university systematizes thousands of young people. This is a picture of the way Satan systematizes people. He surely systematizes people by worldly things. If you like movies, Satan puts you into the movie system. If you like dancing, Satan systematizes you with dancing. If you like gambling, surely Satan will send you to Las Vegas. He puts you into that part of his system.</p>
<p>The dividing teachings are also organized and systematized by Satan to cause serious error and thus damage the practical oneness of the Body life. The sleight is of men, but the system of error is of Satan and is related to the deceitful teachings that are designed by the evil one to distract the saints from Christ and the church life. Many fallen human beings are very religious. They like religion. Satan puts them into the system of religion. He uses religion to systematize people just like he uses dancing, movies, and gambling. In the big university of religion there are different departments. There are the department of foot-washing and the department of head covering. Even Bible study can be a part of the satanic system. Some Christians naturally prefer to go to the mission field, so Satan puts them into the system of the mission field.</p>
<p>Before his death Dr. A. W. Tozer pointed out how Christ&rsquo;s real authority is absent in Christendom. He said that there may be a conference of Christian workers talking about how to serve Christ or go to the mission field to work for Christ, to preach the gospel for Christ. Then he said that if Christ came into their meeting, they would ask Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; This shows that they are for their mission work; they are not for Christ.</p>
<p>We all have some fallen human desire. With some people their fallen desire is to dance. With others the fallen desire is to be quiet, doing nothing, giving up the world. Even to give up the world may be a desire of the fallen nature. Some unsaved people may give up the world to be in some pagan religion. They are put into that part of the satanic system.</p>
<p>Everything in today&rsquo;s Christianity has been utilized by Satan to systematize people. There are only three things that Satan would not utilize. (1) The Bible tells us that God is the unique God and the jealous God. We should not worship anything other than God. That means we should not have any kind of idol (Exo. 20:3-5; 1 John 5:21). Satan would never utilize this point. (2) The Bible also tells us that God created the human race for His purpose. God has to keep the human race in a healthy, sound, good, and pure situation for His use. So the Bible is strong against any kind of immorality, because this damages man&rsquo;s humanity (1 Thes. 4:3-4; 1 Cor. 6:18). Idols damage God&rsquo;s person. Immorality damages humanity. Satan would never utilize these two points. (3) The Bible tells us that the Lord is greatly concerned for His Body, that is, the church. So for the Body of Christ, for the church, there should be absolutely no division (1 Cor. 1:10; Eph. 4:3). Idols are a damage as an insult to the person of God, immorality is a damage to humanity, and divisions are a damage to the Body of Christ. It is only these three things that Satan would never use. In other words, as long as you stay away from idols, immorality, and division, you stay away from Satan&rsquo;s system. Do not trust in any doctrines, not even the good ones. Satan can utilize even the best doctrine to systematize you. It is only the three things mentioned above that Satan can never utilize.</p>
<p>Even the scriptural teachings can be used by Satan to distract us from the Body of Christ. We have to be so clear. A doctrine may be good, scriptural, pure, and sound, yet utilized by the enemy to distract us from Christ and the church life. In the universal university of Satan, there are some bad departments and some good departments. Even there are the best schools of the best things. Satan will use whatever he can to distract us from the Body. This is why I say that we all need to be rescued, to be snatched out of the system of Satan.</p>
<p>For the long run for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I am burdened to uproot all our old concepts. This may be illustrated by uprooting the weeds from a field. It is not enough just to cut them. If you just cut them, the root is still there. After a while, they will grow up again. They must be uprooted. My burden is to uproot all the devilish factors that were sown deeply into our being in the past. Our religious concepts may be good, but they are used by Satan.</p>
<p>Paul desired that we might be no more children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, or doctrine, not heresies. This is in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error. This word shows that all the doctrines are utilized by Satan to form his satanic system and to put you into a particular part of his system according to your fallen desire, according to your human tendency. The purpose of this is to keep you away from the building up of the Body. Even your zealousness for the gospel can be a system. Satan can systematize you according to your zealousness. A young man came to one of our meetings and told the brothers, &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have this kind of meeting. You all have to go out to preach the gospel.&rdquo; No doubt, he was systematized in the satanic system, being distracted from the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The best way to get out of the satanic system is to be altogether no more religious. We have to jump out of religion. Do not be afraid that we will be loose people. As long as we do not have idols, as long as we stay away from immorality, and as long as we stay away from any division, we can never be loose people. We have three safeguards: (1) no idols, (2) no immorality, and (3) no division. As long as we take care of these three things, we are fully safeguarded. We all were put into Satan&rsquo;s system, and we have been staying in the departments of the satanic system for a long time. Now the Lord is coming to snatch us out of religion. We all need to be snatched out. We need to hate religion, doctrines, forms, and regulations. We need to see the subtlety of the enemy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
