   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thus, we can say that the work of God's new creation occupies the entire Bible except the first two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new creation work of God began from Genesis 3, not from Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's new creation work passes through four main ages: the age before law, from Adam to Moses; the age of law, from Moses to Christ; the age of grace, from Christ's first coming to His second coming; and the age of the kingdom of one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's new creation work started from Genesis 3 and passes through these four ages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these four ages, God does His best to get Himself into man in order to make the old man the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the portion of Scripture from Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation is on God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God worked on the old creation but not for the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God works on the old creation to have a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A butterfly coming out of a cocoon is a good example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cocoon is the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, the butterfly is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God works on the "cocoon," the old creation, to get the "butterfly," the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the time when God began to work on the cocoon, that was the beginning of God's new creation work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, God will get rid of the cocoon and will cause the butterfly to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This butterfly is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we need to consider whether we are the new creation or the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we are the new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when we lose our temper, that is a part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we are the new creation, we are also being renewed and transformed to become the new creation in a fuller way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Much of our being is still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>None of us has fully come out of our cocoon, our old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we are the new creation, but we are still with the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today God is growing in us, expanding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more God grows, the more God expands, and the more the cocoon is reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John the Baptist told us, "He must increase, but I must decrease" John 3:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cocoon, the old I, should decrease, but the butterfly, Christ, must increase by God's growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's growing in us is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am so thankful to the Lord that in the entire Bible there is a verse such as Colossians 2:19, which says that by holding the Head, the Body "grows with the growth of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If He does not grow within us, we cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Philippians 2:13 says that God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the difference between God's growing and God's operating?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can illustrate this by considering young children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order for children to grow, they need to move by running, jumping, and acting in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not sufficient for them to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition to this, they must operate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is no operation, there is no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why the schools have playgrounds where children can exercise, operate, for their proper development and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is the same with us in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not exercise, operate, we cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ones who exercise the most, grow the most.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New Testament, one verse tells us that our God is growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another verse tells us that our God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is not lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more He operates in us, the more He grows in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to cooperate with God's operation in us by exercising our spirit to function by speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The best way for us to grow is to exercise our spirit to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's growth in us depends upon His operation, and His operation is His work for His new creation.</S>
