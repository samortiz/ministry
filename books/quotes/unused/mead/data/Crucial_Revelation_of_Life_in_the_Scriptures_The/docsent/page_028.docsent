   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWLEDGE VERSUS LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 8:1 Paul tells us, "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spiritual not fleshly love, which is an expression of life as described in 1 Corinthians 13, builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It comes from the tree of life, the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Knowledge is something of the tree of knowledge, and love is of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HEALTHY TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Timothy 4:3 says, "For the time will come when they will not tolerate healthy teaching, but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Teaching is something of knowledge, but "healthy" implies the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Anything that is healthy refers to the health of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we need is not merely the teaching but the healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person's teaching might be quite sound but still dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the healthy teaching, the teaching with life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Timothy 4:3 tells us that the ones who will not tolerate healthy teaching "according to their own lusts heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These ones cannot bear with the healthy teaching but they heap up teachers because they have an itching ear, an ear that seeks pleasing speaking for its own pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1964 I was invited to San Diego, and the responsible one in this certain Christian group put up a sign that told people to hear Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I saw this sign, I told the one responsible to take it down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, I would not be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some Christians attend conference after conference and there is no change in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These ones are addicted to listening to good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have itching ears, and these good speakers become a drug to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many teachings were heard, but their daily life remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have only heaped up to themselves teachers who tickle their itching ears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE LETTER VERSUS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the apostles were "ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 2 shows us that the tree of knowledge is a tree of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God warned Adam that if he ate of the tree of knowledge he would surely die Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament says that the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Paul talked about the letter, he was not referring to the letter of a newspaper, but to the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense, the Bible kills.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 the letter is versus the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE SCRIPTURES AND THE LORD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists, "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me; and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the Scriptures testify concerning the Lord, they should not be separated from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may contact the Scriptures, and yet not contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only the Lord can give life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we have the Scriptures without the Lord, we cannot receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without Christ, even the Scriptures are merely knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of finding life in the Bible, we could get killed by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without Christ, the Bible is a book of the letter, and the letter kills.</S>
