   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to participate in the enjoyment of the good land, we must first eliminate idols and all things related to idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Deuteronomy 12:2-3 says, You shall completely destroy all the places where the nations whom you will dispossess have served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every flourishing tree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And you shall tear down their altars and crush their pillars; and their Asherahs you shall burn with fire, and the idols of their gods you shall cut down; and you shall destroy their name from that place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before they could fully enjoy the riches of the good land, the children of Israel had to completely destroy the places where the nations worshipped their false gods.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, if we want to enjoy the riches of Christ, we too must eliminate the idols in Catholicism and in the Protestant denominations, any name that is set up other than the name of Christ, and every pagan practice that has been adopted, such as Christmas and Easter.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being in the Place Which God Chose</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Deuteronomy 12:5 says, But to the place which Jehovah your God will choose out of all your tribes to put His name, to His habitation, shall you seek, and there shall you go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, 14:23 says, And you shall eat before Jehovah your God, in the place where He will choose to cause His name to dwell, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil and the firstborn of your herd and flock, that you may learn to fear Jehovah your God always.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The children of Israel had no right to keep the firstborn of their cattle and the top tenth of their produce for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were not allowed to eat these things at home; they could enjoy them only in the place where God chose to put His name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same principle, we cannot enjoy the choice portion of Christ unless we gather together with the saints on the ground of oneness chosen by God.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The children of Israel were required to set aside the top tenth of the produce of the land and the firstborn of the cattle as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Three times a year at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles they brought the tithes and the produce to the house of God in Jerusalem, the unique place of God s choice, and offered them on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was a portion for God, a portion for the priests, and a portion for the one who presented the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, during the feasts, they enjoyed these riches before God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This signifies that God s people should offer the riches of Christ to God on the ground of oneness for their enjoyment with God and with all the people, to be the fellowship between them and God and the mutual fellowship among themselves.</S>
