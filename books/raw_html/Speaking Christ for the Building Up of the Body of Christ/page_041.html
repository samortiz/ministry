 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">A CLOSING WORD</h1>
<p>The fellowship in this chapter may be considered as advice, not as a charge or a law. We need to exercise much wisdom regarding the way we live our Christian life in our locality after we have seen the light concerning the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEVER IMPOSING THE NEW WAY ON OTHERS<br />
NOR PROMOTING IT</h2>
<p>We should neither impose the new way on others nor should we promote it. The best way to carry out the new way is to live as an example. To preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes is altogether scriptural. I do not believe that any of the saints would oppose this. It is possible that some might not be happy to preach the gospel in this way, but we should not impose this on them. It is up to the saints whether or not they would take this way. We trust in the Lord for His doing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO PRACTICE THE NEW WAY<br />
AS THE LORD LEADS<br />
ACCORDING TO THE LIMIT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES</h2>
<p>You also need to endeavor to practice the new way as the Lord leads according to the limit of the circumstances. You may be in a local church which does not practice the preaching of the gospel by visiting people in their homes. On the one hand, you should not impose this on others or promote it. On the other hand, you can carry out your burden for this on your own. You can follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to fellowship with one or two others who would be burdened to go with you to preach the gospel according to the God-ordained way. The Lord will surely lead you to some sons of peace.</p>
<p>In the old way, we were inviting the people, the &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; to come to us, and they would not answer our invitation. That was the reason we did not gain many people in the past. But in the new way we are going to the fish, and we have the assurance in the Lord that we can gain some. If you can gain one new one every three months, you will gain four in a year. This is a good number. But you have to consider how many new ones you and the other saints in your locality are able to take care of. If six in a locality of only fifteen saints are burdened to preach the gospel by visiting people, they can gain twenty to thirty new ones in a year. Actually, if they went out every week they could gain more, but I do not think that this is wise. If we deliver many babies and are not able to care for them, this is not good. Thus, we have to apportion our manpower and our time. The best way for us to take is to gain one or two new ones every three months. Then we will reap some for each of the four seasons. As we take care of them they will grow, and after a year they will be raised up to do what we are doing in the gospel service to the Lord.</p>
<p>If we take this way quietly without promoting it or imposing it on anyone, we will not offend anyone or stir up different opinions. We must do our best not to stir up any turmoil, debate, or argument. The saints will not oppose or criticize you if you preach the gospel by visiting people and set up weekly home meetings with the new ones that you gain. If the church in your locality does not practice the new way, you should do your best to attend the regular meetings of the church, at least on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and if possible the prayer meeting. Then you could reserve one evening a week to either preach the gospel or care for the new ones in their homes. Actually, these home meetings are church meetings in the eyes of God. Do everything in your locality in a loving, nice, and wise way. This is what it means to practice the new way as the Lord leads according to the limit of the circumstances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPRESSING THE LORD&rsquo;S<br />
HUMILITY AND FORBEARANCE<br />
IN ANY STEP OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Do everything in humility with forbearance. Never do anything arrogantly. If we are doing a good work to preach the gospel and raise up the home meetings, we should not have a proud spirit or attitude. If we are living in and with the divine Trinity, none of us can be proud. We always have to be humble and forbearing. In any situation we should not overstep the limit the Lord has given us.</p>
