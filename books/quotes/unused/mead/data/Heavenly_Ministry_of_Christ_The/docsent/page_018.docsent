   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR BEQUEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already covered three aspects of Christ s heavenly ministry: how He exercises His rulership over the whole world that His gospel may be preached and God s called people be brought in; how He exercises His headship to cause us to grow and function that His Body may be built up; and how He intercedes for us and cares for us as our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the fourth aspect: how He executes the testament He has bequeathed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the execution of the new testament by the heavenly Christ, He is making all the items listed therein real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all like to be remembered in someone s will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am sure that all my children, and even my grandchildren, are expecting to be included in my will!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose we were willed a large piece of property with a mansion containing twenty-four rooms and seven bathrooms and, in addition, ten million German marks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would surely be pleased!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we would need to make sure that the inheritance was more than just two items written on paper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The will would have to be executed in order for us to come into possession of what we had been bequeathed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you ever tried to find out what is included in the new testament?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a long list!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, after trying many times to enumerate all the items, I have concluded that it cannot be done.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The list is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here are some of the items: redemption, forgiveness of sins, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, sanctification, sonship, life, power, peace, holiness, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you received all these bequests?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes the heir is young and does not realize what he has inherited.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Or perhaps the heir is simple and cannot understand the meaning of the terms in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Or in a third case, the heir may be too weak to lay claim to his inheritance, even though he is mature and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In all these cases, someone is needed to help the intended heir gain possession of what has been bequeathed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE COVENANT ENACTED BY THE BLOOD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ died on the cross, He made God s promise a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His blood was the enacting symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s table, which we have week by week, is a symbol of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord took the cup and gave thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He gave it to the disciples, saying, Drink of it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins Matt 26:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The words in Luke 22:20 are: This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cup that we take is the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a profound fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we take the cup, we need to realize that it is the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two main items in the new covenant are the forgiveness of sins and the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By these we enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the blessing of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the eternal portion of its blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood of Jesus, then, enacted the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His death confirmed it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then in resurrection He comes to execute its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TESTAMENT EXECUTED</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is now in the heavens, living, divine, capable, constituted of the indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing can thwart Him!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing can destroy Him!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the living One, living forever!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, He is able to execute this testament in every detail.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you need life? power? forgiveness? peace? holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, your needs are many.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can you be supplied?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the testament are all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are bequeathed to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ today is executing the testament, making every item available and real to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose your wife gives you a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need patience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where can you find the patience to endure being under her thumb?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Patience is one of the items listed in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is applied and made real to you by Christ s execution.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When patience is your need, He will make it available to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will have the sense that patience comes into you like a flood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is this not your experience?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The same is true of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may be suffering, but there is joy in this will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How can that joy be real to you?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ Himself will execute joy into you, flooding you with it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may wonder how I can have so much to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may think I will run out of things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Included in this will, though, is the rich Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I am to give a message, I do not turn to reference books to find a subject, to put together some points, to study some commentaries, and to thus organize what I shall say.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ as the Executor floods the riches of God s Word into me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Out of this flood comes the rich thought, the rich utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus the speaking is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What a will we have!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What an Executor living, powerful, capable!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ s intercession is part of the execution of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may be short of life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may not be enjoying God as your life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your High Priest will then pray for you, that you may have the rich enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is His intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then He will exercise His position to execute the life and light from God into you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the answer to His intercession and also the enforcement of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>OUR CORRESPONDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Just as you need the proper correspondence to His intercession by coming to the throne of grace, so you also need the proper corresponding to His executing of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You have been lacking in this corresponding because of not being helped to see these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Probably you have never before heard such messages.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From now on, there is no reason to be off; you can correspond to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hebrews 7:25 gives us the way to correspond to His executing of the new covenant: Wherefore also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We cooperate with Him by coming forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Keep coming forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Morning and evening, day and night, while you are praying and when you are not, come forward to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>O God, I am open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I need all there is for me in Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I want to stay open to You all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As you do this, Christ the able One will execute into your being whatever you need.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is part of His heavenly ministry to thus execute item after item from the will into you for your enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To realize this will be a strengthening to you.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Suppose your working day is over and you are ready to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You have put in eight hours of hard work, and you are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But the thought of going home is not very appealing, because you never know what situation will confront you.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whether you will be greeted by a long face or a smiling face you cannot predict.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Some days when you go home, you encounter a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Other days it is calm and sunny.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You cannot bear to walk into a storm tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do not forget the will!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Open yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Come forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You may only say, O God my Father, I am opening myself to You, and you will have the deep conviction that you are strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He has interceded for you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He has also executed something into you.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You are strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Now you are ready to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>You can declare, Lord, whether the weather is wild or mild doesn t matter to me.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I want to go back home and enjoy You.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It may be under a clear sky or a cloudy sky.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Rain or shine, I will still be opening to You.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You will be my supply, according to Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I am included in Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Father, that will binds You.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Moreover, I have an Executor, who is seeing to it that I get all the items listed in that will.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>My circumstances don t bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Your will makes every provision for me.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Christ s heavenly ministry is not over.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>His earthly ministry has indeed been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But as the Executor of the new covenant, He is still ministering to strengthen, comfort, supply, sustain, and even bear you.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>His purpose in so doing is that you may grow and function that His Body may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>His heavenly ministry, the goal of which is the building up of His Body, has many different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We have already considered four of them.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>There is the exercise of His rulership, the exercise of His headship, the priesthood, and the execution of God s will and testament.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In the next message we shall go on to another aspect.</S>
