   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem of Being Close to</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Not Contacting the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that we are one spirit with the Lord, in our daily experience we are often not one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, the Lord is the Lord, and we are we.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we need to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to contact the Lord, we need to eliminate any kind of insulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Electricity is a good illustration of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is real, living, and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although electricity is powerful, if we do not contact electricity, we will have no sensation that it is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Electricity is not visible in a wire, yet it is real and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, to separate something from electricity does not require a large amount of insulation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only a little insulation will stop the flow of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Similarly, the power of the church, Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is always available within our spirit, but most believers are detached from this divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not need to be miles away from the Lord to be detached from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many believers are very close to the Lord yet are not attached to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may say, I am not far away from the Lord; I am quite close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Five years ago I was far away, but the Lord has gradually brought me back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now I am very close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of how close to or far from the Lord we are, if we are not contacting Him, it is essentially the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A few saints may be very far from the Lord, but most are not far from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may come to all the meetings and be very close to the Lord yet still be detached.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may hear this word and say, If this is the case, I do not need to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if I come to the meetings, I am still detached.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, being close to the Lord by being in the meetings does make some difference.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is very difficult for those who are far away from the Lord to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if we are close to the Lord by being in a meeting, perhaps we will contact Him after hearing only a few words in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, to be close is much better than to be far away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, we need to be not merely close to the Lord but actually attached to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to have a direct contact with the Lord, just as an electrical appliance must have direct contact with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There may be a strong current of electricity in a wire, but if there is no contact, no attachment, the appliance will never receive the supply of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our contact with and attachment to the Lord is the abiding of the branches in the vine mentioned in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you v. 4 . This indicates that if we abide in the Lord, He will abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our abiding in Him is a term, a condition, of His abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once again, we can use the illustration of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If an appliance is attached to an electrical outlet, the electricity will come into it and supply it with the power it needs to function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the appliance abides in the electricity, the electricity abides in it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, if we abide in the Lord, the Lord abides in us and supplies us so that we may function spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE WAY TO ABIDE IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We still need to see the way to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord is real and living, yet He is mysterious, abstract, invisible, and untouchable in a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For many years I wondered how we can abide in such a mysterious, abstract, invisible, and untouchable One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy to abide in a house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We only need to walk into a house and remain there in order to abide in it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the house is physical, we can easily see it, touch it, enter into it, and abide in it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord, however, is not like a physical house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can we abide in such a One?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abiding in the Lord through the Word</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to our experience and the experience of many others, in order to abide in the Lord, we must rely on the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In John 15:7 the Lord said, If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Comparing this verse with verses 4 and 5 reveals that the Lord s words are equivalent to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our words represent us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If people reject our words, they reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Others accept us by receiving our words.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we say that someone has rejected us, we often mean that someone has rejected our words cf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 12:48; 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that our words are us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord s words are the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible reveals that Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Colossians 2:9 says, In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is mysterious, yet all His fullness is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ also is mysterious, but the mysterious Christ is embodied in the word John 6:63; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word is not mysterious or abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The word, which is solid and concrete, is the embodiment of the mysterious and abstract Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through the word Christ has been made solid and tangible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We Christians should daily handle the word as the solid embodiment of the abstract Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our contacting the Lord in order to abide in Him depends upon our handling of His word.</S>
