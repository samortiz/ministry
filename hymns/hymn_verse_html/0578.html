<div style='padding-left:10px'><span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12491' href='#ref_12491'>Gen 4:26</a></span> And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.<br><b>fn 2 </b>The Hebrew word means to call out to, to cry unto, i.e., to cry out audibly. Because men realized that their life was vanity (see note 2<sup>1</sup>) and that they were frail and mortal (see note 26<sup>1</sup>), they spontaneously began to call upon the name of Jehovah, the eternal One (see note 4<sup>4</sup> in ch. 2). Although they were vain and weak, by calling on the name of the Lord, they were made rich and strong, for they entered into the riches and strength of the One on whom they called (Rom. 10:12-13 and notes). See note 21<sup>1</sup> in Acts 2.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12490' href='#ref_12490'>Gen 17:1</a></span> And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him, I am the All-sufficient God; Walk before Me, and be perfect.<br><b>fn 3 </b>Here, to walk before God is to walk in His presence, constantly enjoying Him and His all-sufficient supply. To be perfect is to have God added to us as the element and factor of perfection. Practically, it means that we do not rely on the strength of the flesh but trust in God as the all-sufficient Mighty One for our life and our work.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior. He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest (Heb. 4:8; Matt. 11:28-29), which is Himself as the good land to us.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Noah was able to walk with God (v. 9) in that crooked, perverted, and adulterous generation because he found grace (cf. Heb. 4:16). Grace is God coming to us to be our life supply, our strength, and our everything (see note 10<sup>1</sup> in 1 Cor. 15). Such grace enabled Noah to overcome the flesh and to live a righteous life (Ezek. 14:14; cf. Rom. 5:17-21 and notes).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
