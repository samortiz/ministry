<P>The third section of the "tunnel," or process, was His resurrection. In His resurrection He entered into another realm&#151;the divine, spiritual, and heavenly realm. Before His resurrection He was in our realm, and before His incarnation He was in the eternal realm with the Father. Now He is in the fourth section&#151;ascension.</P><P>In the first section of His process He was the complete God becoming a perfect man in humanity with blood and flesh. Then, after thirty-three and a half years He became a life-giving Spirit. This brought Him into another realm. His incarnation brought Him out of the heavenly, eternal realm into the world in which we are. He stayed here for thirty-three and a half years. Then, through the processes of death and resurrection, He was brought into another realm. Now, in this other realm He is in resurrection and in ascension. His resurrection always goes along with His ascension. Today He is there in ascension busily doing many things.</P><P>He has become the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit has been compounded with divinity, humanity, His all-inclusive death with its effectiveness, and His powerful resurrection with its effectiveness. These are the elements with which the life-giving Spirit has been compounded. Now He has become a compound Spirit. This compound Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. If we want God, we must come to Him. Outside of Him there is no God. If we want to see a genuine, true, real, and perfect man, we must come to Him. Jesus is this man, and today Jesus is in the Spirit. If we want to enjoy, experience, and partake of His death with its effectiveness, we must come to this Spirit. The element of His death is in the Spirit. If we want to experience His resurrection with its power, we also must come to this Spirit. Today this Spirit is the reality of the divine person, the Triune God. This Spirit is also the reality of the unique and perfect man. In this Spirit we also have the reality of the death of Christ and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>I feel very sorry that many dear ones who have been in the Lord's recovery for years have never delved into these deeper truths. This is why their Christian life is unstable, weak, and fluctuating. I am thankful to the Lord that He has kept me for more than sixty-six years through these deeper truths. Every step of our human education, from kindergarten through the four years of college, causes us to undergo certain changes in our behavior, our speaking, and our attitude. In order to serve the Lord properly, we need a certain amount of human education, and we also need to be filled, saturated, and infused with the adequate spiritual education that will cause us to know the Bible not in the black and white letters but in its spiritual, heavenly, and divine significances. We all need to spend some time to obtain the heavenly, divine, and spiritual education. I particularly encourage you young ones to study these truths; this will help you to grow. When I was young and I obtained a weighty spiritual book, I did not let the sun go down before I endeavored to study that book, even to some extent not caring for my eating or sleeping. The reason that I have lived such a long and healthy life is my studying of the truths of the Bible. Studying has been my "hobby." Regardless of how many things came to offend me, I found that the best way to put the offending things aside is to study the divine truths in the holy Word.</P>
