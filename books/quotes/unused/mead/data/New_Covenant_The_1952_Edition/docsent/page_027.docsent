   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Softening of the Stony Heart</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Moving of Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ezekiel 36:25-27 speaks of at least five things: 1 we have been cleansed with clean water; 2 we have been given a new heart; 3 we have a new spirit within us; 4 our stony heart has been removed, and we have been given a heart of flesh; and 5 God s Spirit has been put within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The result of putting these five things together is that we might walk in God s statutes and keep His ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have already pointed out that God has given us a new heart with a new spirit and that the Holy Spirit dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we shall give attention to the matter of how God removes our stony heart and gives us a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must realize that when we speak of a stony heart and a fleshly heart, it does not mean that we have two hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have only one heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A stony heart refers to the hardness of the heart, while the fleshly heart refers to the softness of the heart; but the heart is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we were saved, God gave us a fleshly heart, but our stony heart was still there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We could say that on one hand we had a fleshly heart, while on the other hand we had a stony heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The removal of the stony heart is not something which occurs all at once, but is a gradual softening.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To what extent God s life can grow in us depends completely upon how much our heart is softened.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our stony heart must be gradually transformed into a fleshly heart so that God s life can move out with no hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among God s children, many have had the following experience: first they were saved and their hardened heart became softened, but not completely softened.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time of their salvation their heart was softened perhaps seventy percent, but after a while their heart becomes hardened again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems as if they have gone back to their former condition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, this hardening of the heart seems worse than before.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps the heart is caught by certain things, touched by a certain person, entangled by some object, or attracted by a certain job.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These things begin to drag the man down.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are all problems of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether the life can grow and spread in us depends completely upon whether our heart is transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It depends upon whether our heart is soft or hard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our heart is caught by things other than God, whether it is some thing, some person, or some matter, it will always hinder the moving of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, God wants to transform our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will continue to transform us until our heart is completely changed into a fleshly heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then God s Spirit will cause the life in us to move out in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God s life desires to move out within us, He always touches our heart first, causing our stony heart to be softened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people are touched by God s love, others by His disciplining.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the children of Israel turned away from God, He smote them and they turned back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Another example is that of a sister who was captured by her child, overly treasuring it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God spoke once, but she would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God spoke twice and three times, but still she would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then God took the child away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time her heart was turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another brother was ensnared by his business.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God spoke once, twice, five times, ten times, but he would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then God caused his business to fall apart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that point he was turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some who have served God have been caught by the work being busy from morning till night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that the work is something spiritual, but it can capture the heart and take the place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To a certain one in such a situation God spoke once, but he would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God spoke ten times, and still he would not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God struck him and he fell; his heart became enlightened, and thus he turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some brothers and sisters have their special practice, their special merit, or their special righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But their practice, merit, or righteousness becomes their boast, the yardstick by which they measure others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These things crowd their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God speaks to them once, twice, ten times, twenty times but they do not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then God s hand comes upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time they become enlightened and prostrate themselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their hearts are completely turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By such a work God is transforming a stony heart into a fleshly heart so that His life can move without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If your heart has been touched by God, you will spontaneously say, O God, I consecrate myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I want You to turn my heart wholly toward You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you offer yourself in such a way and allow God to do the work, He will move in you, and when He moves you will see something, hear something, and feel something.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are willing to obey God, His life will move out into your conscience, into your mind, into your will, and into your emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this manner, God s life will continue to move in you without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Two Conditions for the Moving of Life</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The law of life should be continually moving out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God wants to move out through the different inward parts of our being, but many times when the law of life moves it runs into a hard wall and cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is a hindrance to the moving.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in order for the life to move and get through, we need to fulfill two conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Obeying the First Sense of Life</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first condition is to obey the first sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Unless a man is not regenerated, he will have some sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A Christian who was a medical doctor asked a preacher the following question: Both the beginning and the growth of our spiritual life start with hunger and thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, many people do not feel hungry or thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When that is the case, how can we cause them to become hungry and thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The reply was: You are a medical doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You know that a man has life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Unless a man is dead, he will have some appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then how do you increase his appetite?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You prescribe something for him to increase his appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As he takes medicine, his appetite increases little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You continue this until his appetite is restored to normal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, whenever we have a little sense, we should obey this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we obey this sense, our hunger and thirst increase slightly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we obey more, the hunger and thirst increases again and our sense becomes stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we obey a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The more we obey, the stronger the sense will be.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>By taking this way we become alive from within.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord s life moves within us in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It moves into our emotion, causing us to turn to God; it moves into our mind, causing us to turn to God; then it moves into our will, causing us to turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By such continuous moving and turning, the life within us will be increased, deepened, and caused to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, we need to begin by obeying the least sense.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whenever there is a sense, we should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some will ask, After obeying, what is next?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The answer is that before you obey the first sense you need not worry about the next step.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>According to the Scriptures, God never gives a man two senses at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Abraham is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When he went out, he did not know where he was going Heb 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He only knew that God wanted him to leave his home, his land, and his kindred and go into a place which God would show him Acts 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>His first sense was to leave Ur of the Chaldees.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The leading of life will never cause you to be independent, but always dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Abraham s experience was this: I will take this first step.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The next step I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But as he walked step by step, he was fully dependent upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God not only gave Abraham faith, but also wrought His life and nature into Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Therefore, after obeying in the first step, you still need to continue to look to God, committing the second step to God through fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>By going on in this way, step by step, God will give you guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When by God s grace we learn to follow Him from within, there will be feelings in us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we go on in this way step by step and make a move which is beyond God, a move which does not match the life within us, we will immediately sense the forbidding of the Holy Spirit Acts 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Immediately, you will sense that the Spirit of Jesus suffers you not Acts 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you obey the inner guidance again and again, either to do or to stop, you will grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We repeat that we need to obey the first sense of life; even the least sense needs to be obeyed, for obeying is an important condition in allowing the life to move.</S>
