<h2 class="head2">Early New Testament Church Meetings</h2>
<p>The Israelites in the Old Testament are a type of the church in the New Testament. When the church began in the New Testament, there were only one hundred twenty disciples plus the Lord Jesus. On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were added to the church (Acts 2:41). Thus, the number of the Lord&rsquo;s believers became three thousand one hundred twenty, and they immediately started to live a meeting life. Verse 44 says, &ldquo;All those who believed were together,&rdquo; and verse 47 says, &ldquo;The Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.&rdquo; This means that the Lord added people to their gatherings, and it shows that they were an assembly. Verse 43 shows that when they gathered together, the authority of God was with them, and fear was upon every soul. Soon another five thousand men were added (4:4). If women were added to this number, surely there must have been ten thousand, all of whom were living a corporate life, a meeting life.</p>
<p>The needs of the multitude of believers resulted in two types of meetings. The first type involved joint meetings of all the believers. The temple was used as a gathering place for this kind of meeting, because the temple was a public area, spacious, and able to accommodate many people. The second type of gathering was from house to house. In these gatherings, the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, learning the truth, breaking bread, praying, and announcing the gospel from house to house (2:46; 5:42). Acts 20:20 also speaks of these two aspects in the work of the apostle: &ldquo;I did not withhold any of those things that are profitable by not declaring them to you and by not teaching you publicly and from house to house.&rdquo; When Paul was in Ephesus, he taught publicly, and he went from house to house teaching, persuading, instructing, and declaring to the believers all the counsel of God, not withholding any of the things which were profitable. According to the Bible, the meeting life of the early church involved large, joint gatherings and smaller gatherings from house to house. The gatherings in the homes are the small group gatherings that we are emphasizing today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOINT MEETINGS BEING<br />
IN THE NATURE OF SCHOOL EDUCATION</h2>
<p>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the gatherings of the church have two functions. Joint gatherings are in the nature of school education and home gatherings are in the nature of nourishing. In the joint gatherings we teach and speak the truth in the Word of God concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not a small matter. When Peter started to speak in Acts, the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was only beginning to be released, but by the completion of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles, the mystery of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was fully unveiled (Col. 1:25-26). The twenty-seven books of the New Testament contain the full revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which involves the Triune God passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and becoming the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into His believers. Through His process, the Triune God has released the divine life and can impart the divine life into us to become our life and nature. Individually we are sons of God, and corporately we are members of the Body of Christ, the house of God with a corporate meeting life.</p>
<p>Meetings are indispensable for the believers. When we stop meeting, the issue is spiritual death. Our experiences tell us that it does not take long to sense that something is wrong when we fail to gather with the saints. If we do not meet for six months, we will be quite dead in our spirit. Meeting with the saints is a crucial matter in the spiritual life of a Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning the Truth in the Twenty-seven Books<br />
of the New Testament</h2>
<p>In the meetings we must learn the truth. There are thirty-nine books in the Old Testament and twenty-seven books in the New Testament. We should learn the content of them all, especially the books in the New Testament. If we thoroughly learn these twenty-seven books, we will be clear concerning the truth revealed in the Old Testament. We should not think that we must first know the Old Testament in order to understand the New Testament; rather, the New Testament is the key that opens the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Every saved person should learn the truth in the New Testament. We should thoroughly understand the four Gospels, Acts, and Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. The Epistle of James contains warnings based on the failures of others. The Epistles of Peter, John, and Jude all render help. Revelation, the last book in terms of its position and its completion, is a &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; book to Christians all over the earth. Many pastors do not comprehend the mysteries it contains, and they keep it at a respectful distance. This is a great mistake. We must enter into the book of Revelation, because the New Testament is open to us, and God desires to show us His complete revelation.</p>
<p>When I was saved, I loved to read the Bible. However, I could not comprehend much of what I read, especially the Gospel of Matthew. Reading the genealogy in the first seventeen verses of chapter 1 made it difficult to continue to read the Gospel of Matthew. No matter how much I studied these verses, I could not understand them. At that time there were not many reference books to help me. Consequently, when I would begin to read the New Testament, I would start from Matthew 1:18. I read in this way for many years, but eventually I felt that this was not right. Often things that are difficult to understand logically are quite precious, whereas things that are easy to understand are not necessarily valuable. If everything was made of gold today, gold would not be very valuable. As I began to consider this, I realized that there must be a &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; in verses 1 through 17; consequently, I made a decision to consider them more carefully.</p>
<p>When I first started studying these verses, it was a labor, especially since it was difficult for me to find reference books in a small city in the northern part of China. From 1925 to 1936, I spent much time writing a pamphlet called <em>Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> I studied these seventeen verses thoroughly and explained them quite clearly. I believe that whoever examines that pamphlet will gain much help from it. [Note: Much of the content of this publication has been incorporated into the first seven messages in the <em>Life-study of Matthew.</em>]</p>
