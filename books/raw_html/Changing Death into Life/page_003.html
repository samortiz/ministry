        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING TO WEAK AND FRAGILE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>John 2:1 says that the Lord came to Cana of Galilee. The word <em>Cana</em> means &ldquo;reed.&rdquo; In the Bible reeds signify weak and fragile people. Isaiah 42:3 says, &ldquo;A bruised reed He will not break.&rdquo; Hence, reeds refer to weak and fragile people who cannot withstand pressure. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s coming to Cana signifies His coming to weak and fragile people.</p>
<p>People in the world are weak and fragile by nature. Both physically or psychologically, we are weak and fragile. We are weak and fragile in our undertakings and in our morality. Our physical body cannot withstand a little blow. An infectious disease forces us to lie down, and a car accident brings us death. The slightest injury can be fatal to us. Our physical body is weak and fragile. Our psychological being also is weak and fragile. Concerning our psychological being, a little difficulty can cause us pain, and a little sorrow can cause us much grief. We shudder and are terrified by something that is slightly unknown. It is difficult to find someone who has no physical weaknesses or who is absolutely sound psychologically. We frequently refer to someone as being psychologically unbalanced. Most people today have some psychological imbalance, but the condition of some people is less serious than the condition of others. Every condition shows that people are psychologically weak and fragile.</p>
<p>People are also weak and fragile in their undertakings; hardly anyone is happy and contented with his undertakings. Most people have aspirations that cannot be realized, because of their human weakness and fragility. Those who are cautious and conscientious may have some achievements, but these achievements cannot withstand a slight blow. We will not consider serious blows, such as the chaos brought in by wars, natural disasters, and man-made calamities. If there is a little change in the environment or in human affairs, everything that a person has spent his whole life achieving can disappear in an instant. How weak and fragile human beings are!</p>
<p>People are morally very weak and fragile; they are not able to withstand the slightest temptation or enticement. Many who consider themselves to be morally strong and healthy fall prey to money, lust, ambition, and addiction. They lose their fortune and honor and eventually end up in a hopeless situation. Human beings are truly weak, fragile, and pitiful.</p>
<p>Further evidence of man&rsquo;s weakness and fragility is his mortality. Those who are weak will die, and those who are strong and healthy will die as well. Those who are poor will die, and those who are rich will die as well. Those who are lowly will die, and those who are high and honorable will die as well. Those who are illiterate will die, and those who are highly educated will die as well. Death is an unconquerable power. Who can escape death&rsquo;s grasp? Man is extremely weak and fragile in the face of death.</p>
<p>Thus man&rsquo;s condition is portrayed in John 2: a group of weak and fragile people dwelling in Cana, a land of reeds. Human beings can neither withstand nor endure many things. Many things can lead to physical sickness or mental instability. Many things can discourage a person or issue in death. Human beings are weak and fragile. In every respect, whether physically, psychologically, concerning his undertakings, or in relation to morality, man cannot withstand duress. Man is truly weak and fragile. Nevertheless, our Lord Jesus came to weak and fragile people so that they would receive Him as their life. People need the Lord Jesus to be their life because they are weak and fragile.</p>
<p>The Bible says that those who believe in the Lord Jesus receive eternal life. The term <em>eternal life</em> refers not only to a life that is eternal but also to a life that is strong. It is called eternal life because it is unchanging. This life is unchanging because it is strong. The nature of this life is the exact opposite of the nature of the human life. The nature of the human life is weak and fragile, but the nature of the divine eternal life is strong. Therefore, the Lord Jesus as the strong divine life comes to the weak and fragile people in a low and mean place in order to take care of, to resolve, the problems of human weakness and fragility.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING INTO HUMAN LIFE<br />
WITH ITS PLEASURES</h2>
<p>The Lord came to a wedding feast (vv. 1-2). A wedding feast signifies the pleasure of marriage. Marriage is a great event in human life. Human life depends first on God&rsquo;s creation and then on marriage. Without marriage human life has no continuation, and without a continuation human life will cease to exist. Therefore, human life depends on marriage. Marriage is a symbol of human life because it is the center and the focus of human life. Furthermore, the wedding feast is a symbol of the pleasure of human life. The Lord&rsquo;s coming to the wedding feast signifies His coming into human life and also into the pleasure of human life. The Lord comes in order for people to receive Him as their life so that His life can solve the problems of human life; that is, His life solves every problem related to the pleasure and enjoyment of human life.</p>
<p>When we read portions in the Bible such as John 2, we must understand them figuratively. So much is implied in the wedding feast. The Lord Jesus came into this situation. Therefore, when He comes to people, He comes into their human life with all its pleasures. He is not only concerned about our human life with its pleasures; He also wants to solve all the problems of our human life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
