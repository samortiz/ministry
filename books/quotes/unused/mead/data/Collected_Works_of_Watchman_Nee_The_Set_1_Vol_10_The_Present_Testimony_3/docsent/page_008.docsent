   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN CHRIST A Message Given at a Baptismal Meeting Issue No. 25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to remember that we are all sinners because we are all in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone that is born of Adam has the Adamic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not need to make an effort to lose our temper, lie, etc., because Adam's nature, life, and behavior have all flowed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's way of salvation is not by making us better but by delivering us out of Adam and putting us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Similarly, everything of Christ has flowed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible shows that as long as we are in Adam, we will sin; and as long as we are in Christ, we are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in the most secret place of our heart, there is an erroneous desire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We wish that God would do something on us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people make this kind of mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, God never does anything on us; rather, He puts us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people think that because the root of sin is still in us even though we are saved, we need to ask God to do another thing on us: to remove the root of sin in us like pulling out a bad tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps someone has said that we need to pray to ask God to pull out the root of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps some have said that after they prayed for a certain period of time, they succeeded and were sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we expect God to accomplish something on us, this will never happen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible shows us that all of God's work has been accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the day Christ died, every spiritual thing has been accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God will not do any more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we ask God to perform a work on us, God cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can only receive what God has already accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not hope to receive some special light while you are praying or hear some voice telling you that a certain sin has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not expect to have a special feeling that will fill you with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may think that these are good things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, thinking this way involves an evil heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever God does has been done in Christ; it is not done in you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of what God does on you; God has done everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you believe, you will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if you want God to do something on you, you will never have it done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you are in Christ, you have what is in Christ by receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times when you are ill, you wish that God would just touch you with His little finger so that you would be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, God has healed you in Christ; God cannot do anything on you again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as you are in Christ and receive, you will have what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once you believe, the healing is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you want to be victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can never do it!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only Christ is victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you want to overcome the world?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can never do it!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only Christ overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you wish that God would do something?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will never do it because He has already done everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you think that overcoming is something that only happens today?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No, it happened when Christ overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May God grant us the light of revelation and show us what is already in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not have faith, we will have nothing; but if we have faith, we will have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Christ there is victory, justification, holiness, forgiveness, as well as all the other spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God will not work these things on us again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we enter into Christ, all that is in Christ will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This does not mean that we extract something from Christ for our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, it is entering into Christ and letting everything in Christ flow into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we are baptized, we are baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only are we immersed into the water, we are also immersed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The second part of Romans 6:3, "Baptized into His death," indicates that the baptismal water refers to death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first part of this verse, "Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus," indicates that the water also refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times we think that God gives us a glass of water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, God wants us to enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we see this clearly, we will know that we do not have to ask God to do something on us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is done in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>WHAT DO WE HAVE IN CHRIST?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Romans 8:1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You cannot be condemned, because you are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Can you say to God, "I am a sinner, please forgive me and do not condemn me"?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No. God cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God forgives you in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You need not look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You only need to look at Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How do you know that you will not be condemned in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Can you rely upon your experience of a certain day or a certain time?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The only way you can stop me from rebutting you is by quoting the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you quote the Scripture, no preacher on earth can rebut you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even God cannot rebut you because His Word says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Does this verse tell us that we are changed?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No, it says that he who is in Christ is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some say, "I was a Christian for many years but was very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But on a certain day of a certain year, I was revived and became a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What evidence does he have that he became a new creation on a certain day of a certain year?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My evidence is not a so-called revival which supposedly made me a new creation; my evidence is God's Word which says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Perhaps some may say, "According to the Bible, I am in Christ, and I am a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, when I look at myself, I do not seem so new."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I can say that sinners and even many Christians do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After reading this you should kneel down and say, "God, I thank and praise You; Your Word says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am in Christ; therefore, I am a new creation!"</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whenever temptation befalls you and tells you that you are still an old creation, you should say, "God's Word says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you do this, Satan will retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you pay no attention to the temptation and only stand on the side of God's Word, you will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Overcoming does not depend upon feeling but upon God's Word.</S>
