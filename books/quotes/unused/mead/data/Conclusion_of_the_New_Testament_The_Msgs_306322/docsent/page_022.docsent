   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the Believers to Eat and Drink,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Declaring His Death until He Comes</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the object of the believers remembrance for them to eat and drink, declaring His death until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul tells us that at the Lord s supper we eat this bread and drink the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The bread and the cup are the elements of the Lord s supper, a feast, set up by Him so that we, His believers, may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we should remember the Lord by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the Lord s supper we partake of the bread and the cup as the symbols of His body and His blood in order to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is by eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord that we remember Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The following stanza of Hymns, #233 speaks of this:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We long to eat and drink e en more,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To take Thyself in spirit thus,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Till Thou shalt all our being fill</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And true remembrance have from us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we eat, drink, and enjoy Him, the more we render Him the true remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To remember the Lord is not merely to recall that Christ is God who became a man, lived as a carpenter, and was persecuted, arrested, judged, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, to remember Him is to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, we do not remember the Lord by using our mind to meditate about the Lord; instead, we remember the Lord by exercising our spirit to feed on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our remembering the Lord in such a way declares to the whole universe that we daily enjoy Him as our food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is our feast, our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we have been saved and regenerated, we should come together to take the Lord s supper in remembrance of the Lord by eating the bread and drinking the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the first day of every week, we need to come together to remember Him by enjoying Him, that is, by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In so doing, we declare to the universe that we live by daily eating, drinking, and enjoying Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to eat the Lord s supper, we come to establish a testimony to the universe, including all the angels, demons, human beings, and creatures, that we are a group of people who live by Jesus, eating, drinking, and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the Lord s supper we not only remember the Lord but also declare His death until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we eat the bread and drink the cup, we simultaneously remember the Lord and display His redeeming and life-releasing death John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul says, As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word declare here means proclaim, announce, or display.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we are remembering the Lord, we display His death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, we remember the Lord Himself by declaring and displaying His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we remember the Lord, the bread and the cup are displayed separately on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The bread refers to the Lord s body, and the cup refers to His blood; the separation of the body and the blood signifies death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With this display of death, we proclaim and announce Christ s all-inclusive termination of twelve items on the cross: the angelic life Col 1:20 , the human life Gal 2:20 , Satan Heb 2:14; John 12:31 , the kingdom of Satan Col 2:15; John 12:31 , sin 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3 , sins 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6 , the world Gal 6:14; John 12:31 , death Heb 2:14 , the flesh Gal 5:24 , the old man Rom 6:6 , self Gal 2:20 , and all creation Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to 1 Corinthians 11:26, we are to declare the Lord s death until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that when we break bread to remember the Lord and to display His death, we are also waiting for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should display the Lord s death and thus remember Him in the spirit and atmosphere of waiting for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a glorious hope: one day Christ will return and change our body 15:51-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When our body of humiliation is transfigured into the body of His glory at His coming Phil 3:21 , our redemption will be complete Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should take the Lord s supper unto the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back to set up God s kingdom Matt 26:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By His first coming the Lord accomplished His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After His death He went away to receive the kingdom, and He will come again with the kingdom Dan 7:13-14; Luke 19:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The period between His first and second comings is the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church thus bridges the gap between the Lord s first coming and His second coming and connects His death in the past with God s kingdom in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, to declare the Lord s death until He comes may imply the declaring of the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we eat the Lord s supper in this way, with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God s administration.</S>
