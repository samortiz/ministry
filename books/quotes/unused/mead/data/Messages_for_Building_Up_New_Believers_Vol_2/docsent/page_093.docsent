   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acting according to Standards</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The day your son is born is the day you should consecrate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must set a standard for yourself in morality, in conduct at home, and in all moral judgments regarding right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must set a high standard for what is ideal, and you must also set a standard for yourself in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must act strictly according to these standards.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, you will have problems for yourself, and you will spoil your children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many children are ruined by their own parents, not by outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If parents are lacking in ethical, moral, and spiritual standards, they will ruin their children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A young person makes decisions and judgments in his future life according to the training he received during his early years with his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A child may remember or forget what you say, but what he sees surely will remain in him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He develops his sense of judgment from you, and he also develops his system of values from you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every parent must remember that his actions will be repeated in his children; his actions will not stop with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you do not have children, you can do whatever you like when you are happy and give up and forget about everything when you are unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But once you have children, you have to restrict yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to act according to the highest standard of conduct whether you like it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The whole life of Christian children depends on the behavior of their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I remember a brother who said something when his son got into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said, He is just a replica of me and I am just he.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a parent sees something in his children, he must realize that he is seeing himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must see that they are his very reflection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are just reflecting him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through them he can see himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why every couple should consecrate themselves anew to God as soon as they have a child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should come to the Lord and consecrate themselves to Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From that time forward, the Lord has committed a human being, with his entire spirit, soul, life, and future, into their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From that day forward, they have to be faithful to the Lord s commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people are committed to a work for one or two years when they sign a contract.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this work lasts for their entire life; there is no limit to the term of this commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Sense of Being Entrusted</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among believers in China, no failure is greater than the failure of parenting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I think this is due to the influence of paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Failure in one s career cannot be compared to failure in parenting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even failure in being a husband or a wife cannot be compared to failure in parenting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A husband or a wife can protect himself or herself, because both are over twenty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when a child is placed in your hands, he cannot protect himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has entrusted a child to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You cannot go to Him and say, You have entrusted five children to me, and I have lost three.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You cannot say, You have entrusted ten to me, and I have lost eight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church cannot go on if parents do not have a sense of being entrusted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not want to see our children being rescued back from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose we beget children, lose them to the world, and then try to rescue them back.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we allow this to happen, the gospel will never be preached to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our children have been taught many teachings, and we have been taking care of them for years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At least these children should be brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are wrong if we do not take care of our children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please remember that it is the parents responsibility to ensure that their children turn out the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please give me the liberty to say this word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Throughout church history, the greatest failure among Christians is the failure in parenting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is something no one cares much about.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The children are young; they are in your hands and can do nothing much themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are loose with yourself, you will also be loose with them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must realize that parents must exercise self-control, sacrificing their own freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has committed a human body, along with his soul, into our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not exercise self-control and give up our freedom, we will have a difficult time answering to our God in the future.</S>
