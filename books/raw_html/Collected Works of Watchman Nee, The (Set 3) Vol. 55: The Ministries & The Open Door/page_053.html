<h2 class="head1">TO THE BROTHERS IN YIYANG AND KUEIXI</h2><p>We want to thank God for showing us the way of migration and for moving a group of brothers and sisters this way. Some brothers and sisters migrated from here to Yiyang and Kueixi on the twenty-third of this month. Before we parted, I felt a heavy burden to speak a word to the migrating brothers and sisters. The main idea is summarized here:</p><p>First, "I do all things for the sake of the gospel." The goal of migration is the gospel. The gospel speaks of love, sacrifice, denial of self, and giving. Therefore, after migrating to Kiangsi, all elements of our living, whether clothing, food, or travel, must be in accordance with the main goal of being "for the gospel." Even our loving of one another must be for the same goal.</p><p>Second, "unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." If the gospel is to be preached, a great price must be paid. We must be like grains of wheat planted into Kiangsi. We must die in Kiangsi; only then will we be able to bear much fruit.</p><p>We are already taking this way. Because of the Lord's love, we are willing to give up a more comfortable life and live for the gospel in a remote area. This is pleasing to God. For the future of the migrations and for the way of the gospel, I feel that I must present a word to you:</p><p>First, please do not give the brothers and sisters who migrated from Shanghai special treatment. It is only right that they have the same food, clothing, and lifestyle as the rest of the brothers and sisters. On the one hand, it is good that you showed your love toward the brothers and sisters from Shanghai, but in reality "differing love" is a hateful thing. Furthermore, its influence on further migrations is too great. For the sake of giving the Lord a way, I hope you will not pay attention to personal feelings but will speak the truth in love. I hope you will avoid divisions among you. It does not matter how much education or talent you have. All are brothers and sisters, and all should do the same work and receive the same treatment and care. Only give the elderly and sick extra food and rest according to their needs.</p><p>Second, all should labor together, working with their own hands. Do not have some overburdened while others are idle, doing nothing but sitting and enjoying the fruit of others. Work and rest, labor, and enjoyment should all be equal.</p><p>May you live out the testimony of the Body so that the gospel may flow out through you. May God bless you!</p><p>Chang Yu-zhi<br />January 25, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">A DESIRE TO MIGRATE</h2><p>It is truly God's will to spread the gospel through migrations. Abraham lived a life of migration. He established a testimony in his migrations. I, too, have a desire to migrate. I have handed over the responsibility for the church in Anchang to others, and I feel peaceful and assured. If God allows, my family hopes to migrate to Kiangsi this year. Do the brothers want me to serve in Yiyang or in Kueixi? Please give me direction.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Fei Chang-bao<br />January 15, 1950</p>
