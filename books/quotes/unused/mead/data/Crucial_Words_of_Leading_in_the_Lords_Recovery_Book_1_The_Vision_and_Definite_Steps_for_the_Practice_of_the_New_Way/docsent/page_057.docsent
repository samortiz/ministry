   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE CARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A year and a half ago, we spoke about the matter of producing full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time, based on our experience and through our observation and study of the ways in which Christians have served throughout the centuries, we were convinced that we could not take the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we had to follow the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Taiwan we have a particular situation with its particular needs and particular means of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We felt that we could produce almost a hundred full-timers a year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is right, of course, not to trust in any organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But it is not proper to be floundering around without any definite leading.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason I suggested that we should produce one full-timer out of every twenty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His or her needs would be taken care of and covered by the other nineteen saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In practice, if a church or a hall produces a full-timer, that church or hall should take care of that full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the elders and co-workers should be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, until now this arrangement has not been implemented in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some full-time sisters have given birth to a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Other full-time saints are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How should we take care of these special cases?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are details, but I would like to cover them in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In principle, when a full-timer is produced by a church or a hall, that church or that hall has the responsibility to take care of him in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the elders should contact those who have a desire to serve full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should try to find out if such ones should actually serve full-time and, if so, for how long and how they should be cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With those who are already serving full-time, the elders should look into their living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may serve for only one or two years, after which they will take up a job again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, some may be supported by their family or their own savings and do not need any support from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With others, the church must take care not only of the serving ones but of their families as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to fellowship these matters with the full-timers in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should know their real situation and find out their real need.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we must take care of them according to their condition and their present circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is easy for us to take the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we do not take the organizational way and instead take the way of following the Lord absolutely, we must be watchful moment by moment, and we need to exercise diligent care and oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, we do not have a choice; we can take the Lord s way only.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the genuine way of those who love the Lord and who have consecrated themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, the elders have the responsibility to fully know the condition of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way we can supply them according to their need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In practice, the elders should not be too legal or set.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should have much fellowship and should try to understand the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should render the proper supply with full consideration of the overall economic situation of the community.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way there will neither be an overabundance nor a lack in their care.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders must put their heart and mind to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should care for the full-timers like caring for our own children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should be flexible and address the needs as they arise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will cover all the needs in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All parents know that even though all their children are their own offspring, they cannot treat them all in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are differences in condition, need, character, and disposition, and each must be treated properly according to his or her situation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The full-timers themselves need to have a clean living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They should not be lavish but should take care of their conscience before the Lord, not being greedy or covetous, and not exhibiting their secret needs before men with the hope of getting more help.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They must do their best to have a clean living before the Lord and to maintain a proper conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they receive more from the Lord, they should learn to give away some of what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus taught us that it is more blessed to give than to receive Acts 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not like to have outward regulations, control, and restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, we want to give everyone the opportunity to learn to live before the Lord and to fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some have asked me, If this is the case, will not some take advantage and receive more?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My answer has been, We must trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such selfishness can happen in the world, but it cannot happen in the church, because we all take care of our conscience to have a clean living before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything is in the Lord s hand; the Lord will uphold His own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be sure, if we take care of others, the Lord will take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a co-worker or full-timer is faithful to the Lord, he will truly find excess in his hands; then he must learn to give it away the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must exercise not to waste anything, spend little on ourselves, and save as much as we can so that we can care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are two sides to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, the brothers and sisters along with the whole church should care for the full-time serving ones before the Lord faithfully in love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the other hand, the full-time serving ones should take care to maintain a clean living and an unfeigned conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If by the Lord s grace we do our best to give to others, the Lord will richly bless us and place us in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we practice this, the Lord will have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who receive much will not be in excess, and those who receive little will have no lack.</S>
