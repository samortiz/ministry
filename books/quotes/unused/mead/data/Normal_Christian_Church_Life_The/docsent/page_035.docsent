   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEVEN FORBIDDEN GROUNDS OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the positive side we have just seen the ground on which God has ordained that His Church be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now, on the negative side, we shall see on what ground the Church ought not to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 SPIRITUAL LEADERS.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Paul points out the carnality of the Corinthian believers in attempting to divide the church of God in Corinth, which, by the divine ordering, was indivisible, being already the smallest scriptural unit upon which any church could be established.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They sought to divide the church on the ground of a few leaders who had been specially used of God in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Cephas was a zealous minister of the gospel, Paul was a man who had suffered much for his Lord's sake, and Apollos was one whom God certainly used in His service, but though all three had been indisputably owned of God in Corinth, God could never permit the church there to make them a ground of division.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He ordained that His Church be divided on the basis of localities, not of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was all right to have a church in Corinth and a church in Ephesus, and quite all right to have several churches in Galatia and a number in Macedonia, for difference of locality justified division into these various churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was also all right for the believers to esteem those leaders whom God had used among them, but it would have been quite wrong to divide the churches according to the respective leaders by whom they had been helped.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul, Cephas, and Apollos were true-hearted servants of God who allowed no party-spirit to separate them; it was their followers who were responsible for the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hero worship is a tendency of human nature, which delights to show preference for those who appeal to its tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because so many of God's children know little or nothing of the power of the cross to deal with the flesh, this tendency to worship a man has expressed itself frequently in the Church of God, and much havoc has been wrought in consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is in keeping with God's will that we should learn from spiritual men and profit by their leadership, but it is altogether contrary to His will that we should divide the Church according to the men we admire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only scriptural basis for the forming of a church is difference of locality, not difference of leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2 INSTRUMENTS OF SALVATION.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spiritual leaders are no adequate reason for dividing the Church; neither are the instruments used of God in our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some of the Corinthian believers proclaimed themselves to be "of Cephas," others "of Paul," others "of Apollos."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They traced the beginning of their spiritual history to these men, and so thought they belonged to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is both natural and common for persons saved through the instrumentality of a worker, or a society, to consider themselves as belonging to such a worker or society.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is likewise both natural and common for an individual, or a mission, through whose means people have been saved, to consider the saved ones as belonging to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is natural, but not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is common, but nevertheless, contrary to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Alas! that so many of God's servants have not yet realized that they are servants of the local church, not masters of a private "church."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Churches are divided on the ground of geography, not on the ground of the instruments of our salvation.</S>
