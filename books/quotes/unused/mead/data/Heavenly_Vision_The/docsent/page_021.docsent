   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO BE BUILT UP TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Have you ever seen the building among today's Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are all kinds of Christian meetings and Christian groups, but there is no building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that in these last days the Lord's goal is the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not adequate that we realize that Christ is everything and then come together to practice the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to be built up together as members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unless you are built up with others, you will not be stable with the matter of the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us suppose as an illustration that some building materials are placed on a particular lot or building site.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If these materials are simply left there lying on the ground, someone could come and take them away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if these materials are built up together, they will be stable in their position on the site.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They cannot leave the site unless the entire building is torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In like manner, our position on the ground of the church will not be stable until we are built into the building, into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SEEING THE VISION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND RENOUNCING THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to realize that the hindrance to the building up of the Body is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Certain brothers and sisters have seen something of Christ and of the church and have come to the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, they have never opened themselves to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Outwardly they do not criticize the elders and they seem to be very nice, but inwardly they are critical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem with them is not sin it is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that in order to be built up, we need to be opened, exposed, and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be able to present ourselves to others in fellowship and tell them that we are ready for whatever is necessary to be built up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that in this country the Lord intends to build up a real expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His desire is not that we simply come together and meet together but that we be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, how we need the vision of the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be burdened to pray, "Lord, help me to see the vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not good enough just to be a Christian and a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I must be built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a practical way, I must be a member of the living Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I must have fellowship with others and be related to others in the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's intention is to have the church, and this church must be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be built up in the Body, but the hindrance to this building is the self, one of the last things in us to be dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would be built up in the Body, the self must be condemned, denied, rejected, and renounced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day the self must be renounced in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only when the self is renounced will we have the Body and be genuine members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is by the Body that God's purpose will be fulfilled; it is by the Body that Christ will be expressed; and it is by the Body that the enemy of God will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nothing is as worthy as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not even the preaching of the gospel is as worthy as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing can compare with the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May we all see the vision of the Body and be captured by this vision.</S>
