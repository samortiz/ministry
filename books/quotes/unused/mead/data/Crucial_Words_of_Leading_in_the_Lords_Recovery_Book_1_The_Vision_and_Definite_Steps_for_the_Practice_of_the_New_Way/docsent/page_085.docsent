   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPREADING THE LORD S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Please forgive me for saying all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I may appear to be a foolish man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It may seem that I am beside myself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I have seen a vision and have received a burden to release the truth in the Lord s recovery item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These truths are published in books, but these books are only sitting on our bookshelves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Meanwhile, the entire Christian world, with all the children of God, is starving spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that it is to our shame that these truths have not gone out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have wasted the Lord s great grace upon us!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thirty-five years ago I came to Taiwan with only my two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among us we had only a few books by Brother Nee and a hymnal consisting of about one hundred eighty songs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I began to publish a magazine entitled The Ministry of the Word and a book entitled Crucial Truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time there were twelve members in my family, but we lived in a studio that was big enough for only eight beds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was no desk; I had a rattan coffee table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I prepared all the publications from that table and began the work in Taiwan in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the past thirty-six years, we have published many books, but they are all sitting on the shelf.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This truly grieves me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot bear to think of this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Lord s mercy, I am sharing this with the co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope we will receive this fellowship from a foolish man 2 Cor 11:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord did not have a way among us in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tragedy is that we know what the way of the Lord is; our eyes are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know that His truth is in our hands, but who will send this truth out?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may say you can sleep peacefully, but I cannot sleep peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am an old man, yet I still want to spend and be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to be able to answer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For years there was no progress in the work of translating the Bible into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been here for two months, and there is now a good foundation laid in this work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, this is not an easy task.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, this is not that difficult a task.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It all depends on whether or not the brothers are willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that from now on, we will all make a strong resolution to advance and make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strive to produce some result, and labor to spread the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers, I hope we will make a strong resolution to accomplish something while we are still young and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be like those in Judges 5 who made great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must achieve something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must never bury the grace that the Lord has given us or the gain that we have received from our training.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord returns, we will be in trouble if the treasure within us is not dug out and the talents are not utilized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that we will spend all we have and will not hold back anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have a talent, we should spend a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have two talents, we should spend two talents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only then will the Lord have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, we can wait for fifty years and nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today there are almost twenty million people in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only five hundred thousand are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we not ashamed of this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been here for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The gospel has not spread very far.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do our hearts not ache?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps we have grown numb to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that this word will prick our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A WORD OF EXHORTATION</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Dear elders, there are no easy tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even to be a little elder is a difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to struggle and strive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe we all love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of us are willing to consecrate ourselves to the Lord and sacrifice for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Regrettably, in the past we did not receive this kind of help.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That was a great shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope we will take this fellowship and the exhortation of the apostle in his revelation concerning resurrection: Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord 1 Cor 15:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The word used here is not work but labor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To labor implies not being discouraged, pressing on, and striving with all that one has.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For any work, before success comes, there are struggles, frustrations, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One has to strive and labor before he can reach his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to build up the home meetings, the truth meetings, the community work, and the campus work there must be this kind of labor and struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope every elder will struggle and strive in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not avoid the difficult path and take the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nor should we settle for the light tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must endure to the end. Nothing and no one should deter us, and we should never be discouraged or dejected.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Success is not measured in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No account is settled until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We were born here, raised here, saved here, and perfected here.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today it is the Lord who has honored us by making us elders.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must respect this honoring and give our all to His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must not only give our money and our career; we must give our blood and our life as well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we have this kind of spirit, we will be successful elders.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Based on my experience of more than thirty years, and according to my studying and observation, I can say that the three ways that we have fellowshipped today are the best and most excellent ways.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In addition to these ways, we have the richest inheritance, which is the truth among us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It serves as our shield and support.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Everything depends now on how we conduct ourselves in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I hope we will take this word of encouragement and exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope the elders will have an elders meeting at least once a week to pray and fellowship much and to take up the burden of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May the Lord be gracious to each of us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Lord, we bring all the situations before You.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We believe everything is in Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We believe that the recovery is Yours and that all the moves are Your moves.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We believe fully that You will gain the glory in Taiwan and will spread Your kingdom here.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For this reason, bless all of us.</S>

   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>May their work and walk in Your presence be burnt offerings on the altar, and may they be acceptable to You.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Lord, we are full of peace and rest and are assured that this is what You want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You will accomplish this work for the coming of Your kingdom and the realization of Your will on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Lord, cover the co-workers and the elders, especially the elders in all the meeting halls, to take up this burden to build up the homes, the truth-teaching meetings, and the work in the communities and the campuses and to produce full-time trainees for the gospelization of every city.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Lord, remember the brothers and sisters and bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>May they consecrate everything on the altar for Your love s sake and for the sake of fulfilling Your work in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Lord, manifest Your riches in the midst of all the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>May You gain a clear highway in Taiwan and gain a glorious testimony on this earth to be a model to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Lord, we look to You to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We hide ourselves in You and exercise to put everything under Your care.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Lord, protect our coming in and our going out.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Protect everyone and every home.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Do not allow Satan any opportunity to attack, frustrate, or obstruct this move.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Lord, take away our discouragement, our lack of confidence, and our fear.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Make us steadfast and immovable, and give us faith in everything we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We desire to see Your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>May all the glory go to You!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May the love of God, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit operate among us, and may we daily enjoy the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Lord, gain this earth and remember Your testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Amen!</S>
