   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECRET OF TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation is the fifth section of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Divine Life Added</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to the Believers Redeemed Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regeneration has added the divine life to the believers redeemed life, making the two a grafted life; thus, the believers participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some Christian teachers hold strongly to the concept of what is called an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This concept is found in the biography of J. Hudson Taylor written by his son and daughter-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this concept, the Christian life is an exchanged life, a life in which we exchange our life for the divine life, the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This teaching concerning an exchanged life is a great error.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament there is no such thing as an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, the first part of Galatians 2:20 says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This, of course, is true: the old I has been crucified with Christ, and this I lives no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in this verse Paul goes on to say, The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, the old I has been crucified; on the other hand, there is a new I, and this new I lives by the faith of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a matter not of an exchanged life but of a grafted life, two lives that have been grafted together to be one life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has added His divine life to our redeemed human natural life and grafted our life with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By means of this grafted life the believers participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers are being mingled with God, and God is mingling Himself with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, the believers have divinity in their being and participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. The Believers Sanctified</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>in Their Nature with the Nature of God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sanctification has sanctified the believers, especially in their nature, with the holy nature of God to change their nature; thus, they also participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we are sanctified, the more we participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>C. The Believers Renewed Mainly in Their Mind</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Renewing has renewed the believers mainly in their mind to change their mind with the mind of Christ; thus, they also participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Three things cause us to participate in God s divinity: regeneration, sanctification, and renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regeneration changes our life, sanctification changes our nature, and renewing changes our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All three things enable the believers in Christ to participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we realize this, we will see that as believers we are not only human but also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we, the believers in Christ, are both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are human and divine persons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are divine as well as human, we are also mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. The Believers Entire Being Transformed</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Transformation transforms the believers entire being, by the transforming Spirit in their spirit filled with Christ, into the glorious image of Christ, that they may fully participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be filled with Christ, who is divine, is to be filled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At present we are participating in God s divinity only partially, but when our entire being is transformed and filled with divinity, we will fully participate in God s divinity.</S>
