   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMATION AND ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Keeping the oneness of the Spirit requires transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason, we should not expect a new believer to be able to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is useless to charge the new ones to keep the oneness, because keeping the oneness of the Spirit requires transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have not been transformed, you will not have the lowliness nor the meekness necessary to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we have been transformed, the more we spontaneously inherit lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All these virtues are our heritage by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The oneness of the Spirit cannot be kept by babyish or childish Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It can be kept only by the transformed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are natural and fleshly cannot be meek, lowly, or long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They cannot keep the oneness, because nothing in their natural being can ever enable them to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, I wish to emphasize the fact once again that 4:2 implies the need of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have problems with oneness because we are so natural, so fleshly, and so much in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if we have been transformed, we keep the oneness spontaneously because in our transformed humanity we have lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE UNITING BOND OF PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 3 speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has abolished on the cross all the differences due to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In so doing, He has made peace for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This peace should bind all believers together and thus become the uniting bond.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before Christ was crucified on the cross, there was no peace between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 2:15, by Christ s abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, on the cross, Christ dealt with all the negative things between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that He also made peace between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now there is no longer a separation between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers nor between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, at the time Ephesians was written, some of the Jewish believers still held the concept that they should be separate from the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, Paul said that the middle wall of partition has been broken down and that the Jewish and Gentile believers must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, there can be no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And without the oneness there cannot be the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, in 4:3 Paul says strongly that we must keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would do this, we must realize that the differences between us have been abolished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The uniting bond of peace is actually the working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By our experience we know that whenever we go to the cross, there are no differences between us and others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, as soon as we come down from the cross, differences appear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is true not only in the church life but also in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Often the love between a husband and wife is buried beneath the differences that emerge when they come down from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only way to get rid of the differences is to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we go to the cross and remain there, the differences disappear, and we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we remain on the cross, this peace becomes the uniting bond in which we keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit we need both transformation and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 4:2 indicates the need of transformation, and 4:3 indicates the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be transformed in order to have lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering; and we need to be crossed out in order to have the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we shall keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
