   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first main emphasis of the book of Hosea is the metaphor of Hosea s marriage with the harlot Gomer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their three children were also metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The son Jezreel symbolized that God would avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel 2 Kings 10:1-11 upon the house of Jehu and would bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel 2 Kings 15:10-12 .</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The son Lo-ammi symbolized that Israel was not God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God used Hosea s marriage to Gomer and his family to demonstrate how Israel as a wife to Jehovah had become unfaithful to her Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second emphasis in the book of Hosea is the evils of Israel as the unchaste wife of Jehovah.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the unchaste wife of Jehovah, Israel was stubborn in her unchastity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This stubbornness is described in detail in chapters eleven through fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These chapters also reveal Jehovah s unchanging love, and this is what we will consider in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and out of Egypt Jehovah Calling His Son</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hosea 11:1 says, When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Israel is depicted as the wife of Jehovah throughout the book of Hosea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when God s everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God s son Exo 4:22-23 , indicating that Israel has the Father s life.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, God loves us as His wife, and the Lord Jesus is our Husband.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The phrase with cords of a man, with bands of love indicates that God loves us with His divine love, not on the level of His divinity but on the level of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s love in teaching Ephraim to walk and in taking Ephraim in His arms shows us that God s love is divine but on a human level.</S>
