For God to get into man, however, was not a simple matter. The Triune God went through a great process in order to dispense Himself into us. We can see this from the revelation of the Bible concerning the divine Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I.

The Spirit of God</H2><P>[The first mention of the Spirit in the Scriptures is found in Genesis 1:2, where we are told that the Spirit of God was brooding over the waters (Heb.).

The Spirit of Jehovah</H2><P>[God's relationship with man, of course, is more intimate than His relationship with creation.] [After creating man, God remained intimately involved with him. In His relationship with man God's title is Jehovah. This is why in the Old Testament the Spirit of God is usually called the Spirit of Jehovah. The Spirit of Jehovah came upon certain people. This indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah has to do with God's reaching of man (Judg. 3:10; Ezek. 11:5). The main titles used for the Spirit of God in the Old Testament are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah.]</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 3: Two Spirits-Two Spirits - the Divine Spirit and the Human Spirit &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
