   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE COMING OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We believe in the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is our fundamental faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the Bible does not tell us the day the Lord will come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only" Matt 24:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen....Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour" 25:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can find similar words in Mark 13.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord told the disciples clearly, "See that no one leads you astray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ! and will lead many astray" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"And then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Behold, there! do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But you, beware" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Beware, be alert; for you do not know when the time is" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said in 2 Thessalonians, "That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let no one deceive you in any way" 2:2-3a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"The coming of whom is according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie" v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples concerning His coming, He reminded them again and again to "beware" Mark 13:23, 33 or "take heed" v. 9 or to "see" v. 5 . This word in Greek is repeated four times in Mark 13.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He also reminded the disciples to be "alert" v. 33 or to "watch" v. 35, 37 . This word in Greek is repeated three times in Mark 13.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, concerning the coming of the Lord, we should beware, and we should watch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should pray, and we should wait.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should be ready daily to welcome the return of our Lord and wait for Him by being watchful and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible does not allow us to do any foolish things such as counting the days or predicting the time of the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If anyone says that the Lord will come on a certain day of a certain month, we have to beware and not be deceived by these words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>PRAYING WITH ONE SENTENCE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some people pray with one sentence repeatedly, such as "praise the Lord, praise the Lord," or "hallelujah, hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They repeat the sentence over and over again and pray with a loud voice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is easy to cause the mind to be blank in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It leads a person into all kinds of strange experiences, such as deception by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the time, however, the person thinks that he is being filled by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ecclesiastes tells us that when we pray to God, we must not be rash with our mouth or let our heart be hasty to utter any thing before God 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord also teaches us not to babble empty words when we pray Matt 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Prayer is not a kind of chanting of Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not to repeat a word over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prayer is telling the Lord what is in our heart Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible teaches us to be quiet and to not be in confusion but to do things becomingly and in order 1 Cor 14:33, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore brothers and sisters, we need to be in fear and trembling and be watchful in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not believe in ourselves too much but learn to be led by the indwelling Spirit within us so that we can learn to obey the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, we have to understand the Bible and reject anything that is not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know that the Lord Jesus overcame the temptation of Satan with the word of God when He was tried in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should spend time to study the Bible and should allow the word of God to dwell richly in our heart, lest we be led astray by the many strange teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We thank the Lord that He has given two great treasures to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One is the Holy Bible, and the other is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we truly follow the Bible and the Spirit, we will not err.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, how easy it is for us to err, and how easy it is for us to be deceived and cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to remember Paul's word in 1 Thessalonians 5:6, which says that we should not sleep but should watch and be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not search the Scriptures carefully, if we do not take the Bible as the lamp to our feet and light for our path, if we do not submit to the authority of the Spirit in fear and trembling, watching and praying at all times, and if we do not have a fear of falling into error, we are indeed in poverty and darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to prostrate ourselves at the feet of the Lord and ask for His shining and His preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to ask Him to give us a firm determination to pay any price to please Him, to reject anything that is not according to the Scriptures, and to accept everything that is according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the same time, we should submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit and not make any proposals of our own or have any considerations of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not act according to our own will or teach others or serve the Lord according to the preference of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the Lord be merciful to the church, and may He preserve the church.</S>
