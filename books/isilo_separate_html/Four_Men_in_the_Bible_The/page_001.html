<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee at a young people&rsquo;s training in Taiwan on February 8 through 12, 1972. According to the <em>Church News</em> report for this year, Brother Lee returned to Taiwan from the United States on January 24 and stayed there for twenty-six days. Other messages given in Taiwan during this period have been published in <em>The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery of Eating</em> and <em>Eating the Lord.</em></p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
