   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEVER HAVING GOD'S APPEARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lot never had God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I read through the verses about Lot again and again, I could not find a hint that God ever appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although God and the two angels visited Abraham, only the two angels came to Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does this mean that God is unfair or a respecter of persons?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is fair and is no respecter of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not follow God in a direct way but in an indirect way and did not walk in the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unlike Abraham, Lot had no direct relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not respect persons, but He does respect behavior, respecting whether or not we are active or passive in seeking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you seek Him, He will appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you do not seek Him, He will not waste His time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That God did not appear to Lot was not God's fault; it was Lot's. God wants to appear to you, but are you seeking Him and walking in His way? Do you have a heart to seek God positively and actively and walk in the way of God? If you do, God will not fail you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will certainly appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>NEVER TAKING THE INITIATIVE IN TAKING GOD'S WAY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lot never took the initiative in taking God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been unable to find a verse which indicates that Lot ever took the initiative in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says that Lot's grandfather took him to Haran; it does not say that Lot followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am somewhat concerned for the young people among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many of them are in the church life because someone brought them here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They did not take the initiative to come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As I look back upon the past fifty years, I can testify that those who showed initiative in taking the way of the church are still strong today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, those who took no initiative but who were passively brought into the way of the church have gradually fallen away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can give you a hundred names of those who were intimate with me and who were helped by my ministry who gradually fell away because they did not have a strong start by actively taking the initiative to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lot should have said to Abraham, "Uncle Abraham, whether or not you take God's way, I will take it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though I am younger than you, I would be the leader in following God and would ask you to follow me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say this is not to be proud; it is to be active.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lot's relationship with God was under the influence of others 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When others were up, he was up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they were down, he was down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lot was like a piece of driftwood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When his spiritual leader drifted into Egypt, he drifted there after him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was altogether under the influence of others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Abraham was drifting southward toward Egypt and the world, Lot should have withstood him and said, "Abraham, if you go downward, I'll go upward."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we see no such tendency in Lot's life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am concerned that in the church life today there is this kind of driftwood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is your relationship with God under His direct appearing or under others' influence?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that Lot suddenly drifted into Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No, it was a gradual development starting from a very weak beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If as you read this message you feel that you have not had a strong beginning, be encouraged for it is still not too late to lay a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>LEAVING OTHERS' SPIRITUAL INFLUENCE BECAUSE OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lot left others' spiritual influence because of material substance 13:5-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When there was only the spiritual influence, Lot kept himself under it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when Lot was faced with the choice between spiritual influence and material substance, he chose material substance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Material substance, that is, worldliness, is a test to those who follow the spirituality of others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Like Lot, they may be righteous but still choose material substance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible does not indicate that in the strife between Lot and Abraham in chapter thirteen Abraham was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, I believe that in a very deep sense Lot's feelings were hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here I would say a word to the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a very difficult matter to deal with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Abraham did nothing wrong in dealing with Lot, but simply because he dealt with him, Lot would never return to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Abraham never forgot Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When he heard that Lot had been captured by Chedorlaomer, he led the fight against the kings and rescued Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Abraham learned that God was about to destroy Sodom, he interceded for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 19:27 and 28, Abraham rose up early in the morning and looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah because he was so concerned for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, because of his hurt feelings, Lot would not return to Abraham, but could say, "I have nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even though you brought me back from captivity, I will never return to you."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Lot was delivered from the city of Sodom, he did not consider returning to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he had returned, his life would not have had such a pitiful ending.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am burdened that the young brothers and sisters will see that it is dangerous to dissent with and to leave the older generation in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When as a child I was rebuked by my mother, I would turn my face away from her for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was wrong and I knew that she had rebuked me in love, but simply because she rebuked me, I refused to see her face.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The principle is the same in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although others may love us, we do not like to be rebuked by them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have learned that rebuking others builds up enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I spoke a frank word in love to certain brothers, and my frankness offended them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This might have been the reason why Lot would not return to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no indication in the Word that Lot thanked Abraham for delivering him from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It might have been that he would not give up his hurt feelings and humble himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not insist upon holding on to such human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We, unlike Lot, should humble ourselves, lose our face, and return to Abraham and remain with him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The sooner we do this and the more we do it, the better.</S>
