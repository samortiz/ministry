First Timothy 2:5 also says, "For there is one God." One is the number that is independent and unique; it does not depend on a second person. This signifies the power of God. One is the number for sufficiency; there is no need for another. This signifies the riches of God. One is also the first of all numbers and is the number of the beginning. This signifies God's greatness, that He is the source of all creation and that He is the head of everything. God is unique. We can get much help by looking at the usage of one in the Bible. Exodus 12:2 says that the Passover is in the first month of the year. This denotes God's way of redemption. The redemption at Golgotha is the beginning of everything. On the first day of creation, light was created; this is God's great power. The first book of the Bible is Genesis which speaks of God's power and glory. Exodus 22:29 says that all the firstborn sons of the children of Israel should be given to Jehovah because they are sanctified unto Him. Exodus 23:19 says that the first of the firstfruits of the land shall be offered to the Lord because the Lord deserves our foremost service. It is pitiful that many of God's children still do not know that God is one nor do they consider Him as one. We should let Him have the first place in all things. Every word that is mentioned only once in the original text of the Bible is crucial and important. One also has the meaning of agreement. Genesis 41:25 says that the dream of Pharaoh is one. This denotes identity. One also has the meaning of peace, as in John 17:11, "They may be one." This signifies association. Putting all the aforementioned items together, we can see that one is the mother of all numbers. Hence, it is the number of God. All numbers originate from one, and God is the beginning of everything. One is the unit that unifies all the numbers; by God all things subsist in Himself. No number can surpass one and be before one, so one represents the absolute God in heaven. All the numbers also have their negative meanings. Although the number one primarily refers to God, when it refers to man, there may be some negative connotations. For example, it refers to man's loneliness and helplessness, or that he is a merciless autocrat, a stiff-necked person, or one unwilling to submit to and depend on others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>God is three-one and also one-three. In this three-oneness, the Son is the Second. Therefore, two is the number of the Lord Jesus. It also implies incompleteness and being short of consummation. The Lord is the second man from heaven. He has two natures-divinity and humanity. His work is also divided into two sections-suffering and glorification. When we read Leviticus, we see that when a man commits a sin, he should take two pigeons or two turtledoves before God. One is for a sin offering and the other is for a burnt offering. The sin offering is for sin; the burnt offering is for man. This also has two sides-God forgives sin and He accepts man. There are many other records of two pigeons and two turtledoves in Leviticus. They signify the Lord Jesus' salvation. Two is also the number for salvation. The Lord Jesus, the Second of the Godhead, is the Savior of mankind.</P><P>Two also means strengthening, support, and fellowship, as it is written in Ecclesiastes 4:9-12: "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him."</P><P>Two is the number of testimony. When two different persons testify, their testimonies are true. Please read Deuteronomy 17:6 and 19:15; Matthew 18:16; 2 Corinthians 13:1; and 1 Timothy 5:19. God's testimony to man is incorporated in two Testaments-the Old and the New. The names of the disciples were recorded two by two (Matt. 10:2-4). When the disciples went out to testify, they went out in pairs. The tablets of the testimony of the law are of two pieces. In the great tribulation, there will be two witnesses (Rev. 11:3). The Second of the Godhead is the Word of God (Rev. 19:13), the faithful Witness (Rev. 1:5).</P><P>In addition, the number two means separation, antithesis, and variance. For example, the work on the second day of God's creation was to separate the waters from the waters (Gen 1:6). When the unclean beasts entered the ark, they went in two by two (Gen. 6:19-20). When a woman gave birth to a daughter, she was considered to be unclean for two weeks, twice as long as when she had borne a son (Lev. 12:5).</P><P>Two has still another meaning. Two is the number for reproduction. It is the first number after something is added to one. Therefore, two is not a complete number; it needs the addition of other numbers before it can be complete. The Father and the Son are not a complete God. They need the Holy Spirit to be added to Them to become three-one and to be the complete God. When a husband and wife become one flesh, in God's eyes, they are not yet complete. Only when they bear sons and daughters are they a complete family.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
