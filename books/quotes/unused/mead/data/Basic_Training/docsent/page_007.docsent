   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVELATION, NOT INFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that everything in the universe is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God, creation, man, Christ, the Spirit, the church, and the future are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even we ourselves are mysterious; we cannot fully understand ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because there are so many mysteries, there are many philosophies, inventions, and discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have seen, every discovery, invention, religion, and philosophy is an inference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if we have the divine revelation, we do not need inferences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose I give a bottle of medicine to a chemist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The chemist may analyze the medicine to find out its elements.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the one who made this medicine knows the formula, and he may say to the chemist, "There is no need for you to study or analyze the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Simply take the formula, which is a revelation of what is contained in the medicine."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have the divine formula for the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, there is no need for us to guess, study, or discover.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We simply need to see the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE DEFINITION OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The basic revelation in the Scriptures is that God in eternity past had an eternal purpose to have a church to express Christ so that God Himself might be expressed for eternity through His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this purpose He created the universe and, particularly, He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this purpose He accomplished redemption for fallen man and regenerated the redeemed man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this purpose He imparted Himself in Christ into the reborn believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this purpose He sanctifies them, saturates them with His divine element, transforms them into the image of Christ, and glorifies them with His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this purpose He gathers them in localities to be local expressions of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the universal church and the local church are uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ, the very embodiment of God, is the content and reality of the church, and the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here there is no division but one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one church, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the basic revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the rest of the teachings in the Scriptures are doctrines related directly or indirectly to this basic revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we isolate any of these doctrines from the basic revelation, the isolated doctrine will become an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, this issue will become a legality that causes division among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That kind of doctrine should not be considered the basic revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DISCOVERIES, ISSUES, LEGALITIES, AND DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christianity has become a maze because it has deviated from the formula, from the basic divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of trusting in the revelation, many Christians rely on their study, inferences, and discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After certain discoveries have been made, Christians have often made issues of them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, the Baptist church has discovered the matter of immersion and has made an issue out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result is that for the Baptists immersion is a matter of legality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This legality causes division.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this insight we can see that every denomination is a legality produced by those who made an issue of a particular discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Based upon this principle, we can say that every denomination is a legality and a division.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these divisions were produced by the discovery of certain things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We in the Lord's recovery, however, do not agree with any legality, and we are not making issues of discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Human society and Christianity have become a maze because both have left the heavenly, divine revelation and turned to study, inventions, and discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>An issue has been made out of each discovery, and every issue has become a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Take the example of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some Christians have made speaking in tongues a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yes, speaking in tongues is mentioned in the Bible, but this does not mean that you should make an issue out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you make an issue of speaking in tongues, this issue will become a legality that controls you and governs you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It will affect the destiny of your Christian life and cause you to care primarily for speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the churches we do not make issues of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We practice immersion because it is found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we do not make immersion a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We practice it without making it an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At one time the question of long hair for sisters was made a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>More than fifty years ago, I worked for a company that sold hair nets.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For a long time we sold only large hair nets.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suddenly, orders began to come in for small hair nets.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I wondered about the reason for this change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then I learned that American women had begun to wear their hair short.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the legality that insists that sisters have long hair, sisters with short hair may not be allowed to come to Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who insist on this legality use 1 Corinthians 11 as their basis.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This, however, is not a revelation, but a legality made out of a teaching.</S>
