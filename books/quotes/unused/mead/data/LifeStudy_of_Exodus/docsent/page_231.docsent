   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the Keeping of the Sabbatical Year</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for the Good of the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 23:10 and 11 say, And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we read that there was to be a sabbatical year for the sake of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the seventh year, the children of Israel were not to work the land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were not to plow, sow, or reap.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, the land would still bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The produce, however, had to be for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt, the poor among God s people must have been deeply touched by this ordinance, perhaps touched to the point of weeping over the tenderness and sweetness of God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ordinance concerning a sabbatical year for the land was a test to many Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, it was a test to those who ordinarily worked the land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, it was a test to one s neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps if one allowed his land to rest, his neighbor would take of the produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his greed, the neighbor may not allow the produce to go to those who are truly poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the book of Ruth we see that, according to the ordinance of the law, the poor were allowed to gather the gleanings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God commanded His people to leave the gleanings in the field at harvest time for the benefit of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These gleanings are the same in principle as the crumbs under the table in Matthew 15 and the produce of the seventh year in Exodus 23.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both the crumbs and produce of the seventh year typify Christ for poor sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CONCERNING MAN S RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD A. Details to the Ten Commandments</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the first and second commandments, man must not have other gods and must not serve images.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 22:18 and 20 and 23:13 details are added to these commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to 22:18, Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was to be no practice of witchcraft for contact with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 20 continues, He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, he shall be utterly destroyed lit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>. Sacrifices to idols were strictly forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, according to 23:13, there was not even to be the mention of the names of other gods: And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Supplements to the Law 1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning Submission to God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and to His Authority</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first supplement to the law concerning man s relationship with God is that man must submit to God and to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s people must submit to His deputy authority, the rulers of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus 22:28 says, Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse the ruler of thy people lit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>. 2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning Offerings to God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to 22:29 and 30, all the firstfruits and all the firstborn were the Lord s: Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Exodus 23:18 says, Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Blood here signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No blood was to be offered to God with leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that as redeemed ones, we should be unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not mix Christ s redemption with leaven, with anything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, the fat of the sacrifice was not to remain until morning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that we should not try to preserve today s spiritual enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It cannot be kept until the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 23:19 we read this commandment: Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother s milk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This ordinance shows that God is tender and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To seethe a kid in its mother s milk is cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s law forbids this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that as the Law-giver God is tender, kind, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning Being Holy Men before God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Exodus 22:31 says, Ye shall be holy men unto me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A holy man is one who is like God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is holy, and we as His people should also be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>4.</S>
