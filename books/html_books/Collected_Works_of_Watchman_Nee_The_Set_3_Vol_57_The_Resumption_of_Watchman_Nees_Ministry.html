He only spoke a few times to the whole church in conference meetings. His main burdens in these messages included the way of recovery that the church takes on earth today, the recovery of the Body life, the coordination of the co-workers, ministry and authority, the relationship between the local churches and the work, release from the bondage of money, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to arrive at the universal priestly service.</p><p>This volume is comprised of brief meeting notes taken by Brother K. H. Weigh and his first wife, Lin I-tien. Except for slight adjustments in sentence structure, the majority of the material is presented as it was found in their manuscripts.</p><h1 class="title">FOREWORD</h1><p>By the mercy of God, the church in Shanghai experienced a great revival in 1947. When news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit. At the same time co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another. Toward the end of 1947 Sister Peace Wang, Sister Rachel Lee, and I went to Hong Kong. Then we went to Canton, Swatow, and Amoy. Finally, in March 1948 we went to Foochow. In all these places we held special revival conferences. After the meetings in Foochow, we went to have some private fellowship with Brother Nee at his home according to a previously-arranged schedule concerning the future of the Lord's recovery. When news of this went out, thirty to forty co-workers around the Foochow area unanimously requested that they be included in this fellowship. With Brother Nee's approval, they all attended the meetings. During these meetings, the need of "handing over'' oneself was brought out one day. Everyone enthusiastically agreed to do this. This subsequently brought in the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry. Brother Nee took care of the need of the meeting in Foochow first, and then went with me in April to Shanghai to conduct the nationwide co-workers' conference. Brother K. H. Weigh and his wife were in most of the meetings in various places, and the content of this volume is taken from their brief records.</p><p>I was present in all the meetings throughout this period of the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry, with the exception of the first two meetings, and I even helped conduct the meetings. I sat face to face with our brother and heard these messages with my own ears. The light that was released was like the shining of the midday sun. Even though forty-three years have elapsed since then, there is a present need to let this light shine forth once again as the rising sun. Under the Lord's sovereignty, we have the manuscripts of Brother Weigh and his wife. When I read them again, every message was filled with the dawning light. What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help concerned the following eight points: (1) the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, (2) the knowledge and denial of the self, (3) the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, (4) the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem,'' (5) the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, (6) the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, (7) the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and (8) the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ. May the Lord grant us the mercy, the grace, and the blessing, that all the above points would be abundantly realized in our work and service of the Lord's recovery.</p><p>Witness Lee<br />Anaheim, California<br />July 19, 1991</p><h1 class="series">SECTION ONE<br />TALKS IN FOOCHOW,<br />SEPTEMBER 1947</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE MERCY OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: September 5, 1947<br />Place: Foochow, Fukien</h1><h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING DEPENDING ON THE MERCY OF GOD</h2><p>When we read Romans 9, we have to pay attention both to its principle and to its application. This chapter reveals the principle that everything depends on God's mercy. The apostle applies this principle to the Israelites. He shows us that everything that happened to the Israelites was of God's mercy. Not only do we need to pay attention to the application today, but we also need to pay attention to the principle behind the application.</p><p>Romans 9:16 says that "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy." Zeal and pursuit are of no use. Neither is the absence of zeal and pursuit of any use. Waiting too long, not waiting long enough, being too quick, or not being too quick&mdash;none of these is of any use. Being in one place or another, hearing much or hearing little&mdash;none of these is of any use either. Everything depends on the mercy of God. Only the Holy Spirit is able to lead men to a proper standing. There must be at least one time that a person sees God's mercy. Concerning this matter, our eyes must be opened at least once. Of course, it is good if our eyes can be opened more than once. But there must at least be one time when we see that everything depends on God's mercy. Whether we see this matter all at once or realize it through a process, the minute we touch this matter, we touch the fact&mdash;not a feeling, but the fact that everything depends on God's mercy.</p><p>God's mercy is a fact. A fact is not dependent on feeling. Take the matter of regeneration as an example. We often tell sinners that they must have a one-time definite experience of repentance and believing in the Lord. To believers, we say that they must have a one-time definite consecration of themselves to the Lord. It is the same in principle in regard to man's understanding of God's mercy. There must be at least one time when a person definitely touches God's mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO DEAL WITH<br />THE MIND, THE EMOTION, AND THE WILL&mdash;<br />BEING TEMPERED UNDER<br />THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Three kinds of people need God's dealings: those who are strong in their will, those who are strong in their emotion, and those who are strong in their mind. Many people are controlled by these three conditions. These three things must experience God's breaking. God deals with man's strong points more than He deals with his weak points. Man's strong points often hinder him from spiritual progress even more than his weak points. Unless a man is dealt with in these three areas, he cannot know God's mercy.</p><p>After a man has been dealt with by God, he will be tempered in his spiritual life. In many things it is inappropriate to be either too much or too little. Some people wait too long, while others do not wait long enough. All these require tempering. Some people are not strong enough in their inner man; their outer man is too strong. This is like a man's head taking up one-fourth of his body or one-sixteenth of his body; neither is proportionate. The right proportion should be one-seventh of the body. Some people are too strong in their mind. Others are too strong in their emotion or their will. Their inner man is not strong enough. These conditions require tempering.</p><p>Once I took a leader of the China Inland Mission to hear Brother T. Austin-Sparks. After the message, others usually would ask about the message that had just been given. But on my way home with this brother, I did not ask him anything. In the end he opened his mouth. He felt that Mr. Austin-Sparks was too strong in his will. I told him that my will was also quite strong. This leader, Mr. Baker, asked, "Then how are you able to get along with him?" Those who are outwardly strong in their will do not easily get along with others. But this brother did not realize that we are one because of our inner man, not because of our outer will. Today, in order for our inner man to match our outer man, our inner man must grow. When the inner man grows, it can control the outer man.</p><p>Some people are too strong in their minds. Their minds need to come under the control of the inner man. I have read the New Testament a few hundred times. Although I cannot say that I have read it more times than everyone else, at least I can say that I have read it more than many people. I could find over one hundred passages that contradict each other. However, I have not done this, because my mind has been under the control of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>If we want our spiritual life to be well-tempered, we need to attune our condition to a proper balance. We must neither be too much nor be too little. This can be compared to shooting on a pinball machine; there are pins to the left and to the right, and the balls must be directed at the optimum angle before they can score. There are many pitfalls in our spiritual journey; our mind, emotion, and will can all become hindrances to us. If we are too much or too little, we fall into danger.</p><p>Everything depends on God's mercy. Before I was saved, I planned to go to America. If I had left two months earlier, I would not have met Sister Dora Yu, and I might never have been saved. Even if I had been given the chance later, I might not have believed. It was God's mercy that I met Miss Dora Yu at that time. It was neither too early nor too late.</p><p>Only God can do things in just the right proportion. We are prone to speak either too much or not enough. No one can preach a message that will meet everyone's need. Even the apostle Paul and the apostle Peter faced the same problem. When words come out of a person's mouth, it is difficult for the words to come out just right. This is why it is easy for people to misunderstand.</p><p>Only God can bring man to a state of true humility. Sometimes a little cross and a little dealing make a person proud instead of humble. Only severe crosses and severe dealings will make a person humble.</p><p>Some people are too spiritual; they think that the Lord dwells only in our spirit. But Ephesians 3 says that Christ dwells in our heart through faith. He dwells not only in our spirit, but also in our heart. This is something that a person can feel. John 15 says that Christ abides in the believers, but it does not say that Christ abides in our heart. Only Ephesians 3 speaks of Christ dwelling in our heart. Some people are too spiritual. They think that the heart does not mean much. However, many of the Psalms speak of the heart. In order to be tempered in spiritual matters, we need to pay attention not only to the spirit, but to our heart as well.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF THE CHURCH&mdash;LOOKING TO GOD'S MERCY</h2><p>The way of the church during the past two thousand years is a way of looking to the mercy of God. Only God's mercy can temper us. I have often told the young people that they may have to wait for five years before they will realize that everything is of God's mercy. A person has an average of one hundred forty thousand hairs. The Bible says that God has numbered every one of our hairs. He knows us more than we know ourselves. When God wants to save us, we are saved. If God did not show mercy, no one could be saved. Once D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel, and a lady was about to be saved. At that moment an umbrella fell and caused a distraction. In the end the lady was not saved. Whether or not a man can be saved is not the responsibility of the preacher. The responsibility of the preacher is simply to present the way to others. Only God's mercy can put a person on the way. It is God's work that puts a person on the way. It is also God Himself who takes men forward on the way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">ON NOT BEING STUMBLED</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: September 7, 1947, Lord's Day morning<br />Place: Foochow, Fukien</h1><p>The first stanza of hymn #144 in Hymns says,</p><p class="hbody">Lord of glory, we adore Thee!<br />Christ of God, ascended high!<br />Heart and soul we bow before Thee,<br />Glorious now beyond the sky:<br />Thee we worship, Thee we praise&mdash;<br />Excellent in all Thy ways.</p><p>This hymn says "Christ of God." We are familiar with the term "Son of God," but we seldom say "the Christ of God." The Christ of God means the One anointed by God and sent by God to accomplish His work. In the original language, the word for Christ is Christos. The word for Christians is Christianos, which indicates that Christians are those who belong to Christ.</p><p>The first stanza of hymn #38 in Hymns says,</p><p class="hbody">Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,<br />Thou Giver of all good!<br />E'en heav'n itself no richer knows<br />Than Jesus and His blood.</p><p>This hymn speaks of the vastness of God's riches. We have to wait until that day before we can fully prove the value of God's love. Some people think that it is good enough for God to give us heaven. However, heaven is not the best thing that a person can have. If a man is just satisfied with heaven, he is limiting God's love. He is in reality limiting God's love to heaven. Some people say that they will be satisfied with a small corner in heaven. These people are limiting God's love to a small corner. However, our God is not stingy. His grace is abundant, both in the past and the present and in the future as well. God sends the rain and the wind in free and full measure. God does not mind giving us a little more than we need. If God were to exercise restriction, it would be a terrible thing for us. Miss M. E. Barber once wrote a hymn that says:</p><p class="hbody">There is always something over,<br />When we taste our gracious Lord;<br />Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,<br />Rich supply He doth afford.<br />Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,<br />Ever issued from His store;<br />To His own He gives full measure,<br />Running over, evermore,<br />To His own He gives full measure,<br />Running over, evermore.<br /><br />(Hymns, #595, stanza one)</p><p>The water that Christ gives is living water. Man only has well water. Well water can never be compared to living water. John 4 says that "the well is deep" and that there is "no bucket" (v. 11). Under these circumstances, man continues to be thirsty.</p><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-19</h1><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING STUMBLED BY THE LORD</h2><p>The passage we just read records how men were stumbled by the Lord. John the Baptist must have been extremely puzzled by Christ. Why would Christ not do something spectacular for him, such as healing the blind and the lame? John the Baptist had given strong testimony for Jesus, declaring that Christ is the Lamb of God and that He comes to take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Later, he declared, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (v. 36). When Christ was baptized, John saw the Holy Spirit descending upon Him (v. 32). However, in Matthew 11:1-19 John was stumbled by the work of Christ. Formerly, he told others that he was not worthy to untie the thong of Christ's sandal (John 1:27). Now he was sending men to Christ and pressing Him to answer honestly if He was the Christ.</p><p>At the same time, it would have been possible for Christ to be stumbled by John the Baptist. John was supposed to be Elijah. He was supposed to be very successful. Why had he ended up in prison, and why had he failed? However, the Lord was not stumbled by John.</p><p>Today many people are stumbled by the Lord. They are stumbled by the way Christ lived. John's food was locusts and wild honey; his clothing was of camel's hair (Matt. 3:4). You cannot find such clothing even in a fur store. Yet when Christ came, He ate and He drank. He was absolutely the opposite of John the Baptist. For this reason, men were stumbled by Him. It is easy for a person to have a preconceived idea of what a spiritual man should be, and if someone does not fit this pattern, this person could be stumbled.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING STUMBLED BY ANYTHING OR ANYONE</h2><p>Around 1921 there were about fifty students in Trinity College in Foochow. They all became Christians through my preaching. At that time I was trying to use Miss Barber's baptistery to baptize them. Miss Barber asked who the baptizer would be. I told her that the Bible indicates that whoever preaches to another is qualified to baptize that one. Miss Barber said that it would better to let Leland Wang baptize them because he was older than I. Later, I tried to recommend Brother Wu Dan-wu, because he was twelve years older than I, and he was, of course, older than Leland Wang. However, Miss Barber insisted that Leland be the baptizer. When I brought up the matter of age, Miss Barber remained unchanged about her choice. I then said, "Since you made up your mind in the first place to have Leland do the baptizing, why did you bring up the matter of age?" In spite of this, I was not stumbled.</p><p>Once Miss Barber wrote me a letter and told me definitely not to come to one of her meetings. Nevertheless, when the time of the meeting came, I went, by forcing my way through the door, so to speak. When Miss Barber saw me, she said, "It is so good that you have come. I have many things to talk over with you. I need your help." In this instance, I was not stumbled by Miss Barber either.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO AVOID BEING STUMBLED&mdash;<br />LAYING ASIDE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES<br />AND REALIZING THE SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2><p>We have to realize the spiritual reality behind everything that God has arranged. We should not merely consider superficial, outward appearances. There may be a thousand things along the way that can cause us to stumble, but rather than being affected by apparent errors, we have to lay aside all these things and look straight ahead at the spiritual reality.</p><p>In 1926 at White Teeth Lake, I saw an article by Mr. Jeffrey in the magazine Witness and Testimony. After Miss Barber saw the article, she told me that Mr. Jeffrey would soon be separated from us. I did not quite agree with her, and I said to her, "You just like to make big assertions and outlandish remarks. This is your temperament." However, after one or two months, Mr. Jeffrey did indeed separate himself from us. Later, when I was in India, I met him and asked why he left. I told him what Miss Barber had told me. After he heard those words, he resolved to take care of the problem that very day. He immediately bought a ticket and sailed home to England to apologize to Mr. Austin-Sparks, because he had spoken something against him when he had left. Today men are easily stumbled by small things. We need the grace of the Lord so that we will not be stumbled by anything or anyone.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION TWO<br />MESSAGES IN SHANGHAI,<br />APRIL&mdash;MAY 1948</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WAY OF OUR SERVICE TODAY<br />AND ITS CRUCIAL POINTS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 9, 1948, 3:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE TWO ASPECTS<br />OF THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: How should we go on in the Lord's service in the coming days? What are the crucial points? What are the things that we should pay attention to in this age?</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee: First, we have to see the condition of the church in this age. Concerning this matter, there are generally two schools of opinion. One group says that the church is always advancing. In every age there are new recoveries of the truths, such as the truth concerning justification by faith and the truth of sanctification. The other group, represented by brothers such as J. N. Darby, says that the present church is in a state of desolation. If you consider the church life of the first century, the absolute consecration seen in Acts 2 and 4, the keeping of the apostles' teaching, and the perfecting of the saints unto the fullness of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4, and compare such conditions with the condition of the church today, there is undoubtedly a vast difference between the two pictures. Once when I was in England, I was invited by Brother T. Austin-Sparks to have afternoon tea at his house. He asked me my opinion concerning Ephesians 4 and when this chapter would be fulfilled. Humanly speaking, the condition of the church today is too far from that described in Ephesians 4.</p><p>If we read the final Epistles of Paul, we will see that the church had degraded at that time. In 2 Timothy 1:15 he said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me.'' Peter's description in 2 Peter of the situation at his time was the same. In the end the apostle John also declared that antichrist had come, and he warned the believers to be watchful (1 John 2:18; 4:3).</p><h2 class="head1">CATCHING UP WITH GOD'S PRESENT WORK<br />TO MAINTAIN THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY</h2><p>Both of these views are true, and they are based on facts. However, what God wants today is to gain a group of people who will stand on God's side under these two contradictory conditions, who will maintain God's testimony, and who will uphold such a testimony of overcomers together with God. In every age God has His work, and the purpose of such work is to maintain His testimony.</p><p>The book of Kings says that at the time Solomon's temple was being built, there was no noise heard. All the materials for the building of the temple, all the stones and the wood, were measured and cut according to size in the mountains, before they were ever sent to Solomon. Every stone and piece of wood was properly coordinated together. This was why at the time of the building of the temple, "there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house'' (1 Kings 6:7). God is doing the same work on earth today.</p><p>The book of Acts is an unfinished book. In the whole Bible only this book does not have an ending; all the other books have an ending. The Pentateuch, the Gospel of Matthew, and the book of Revelation all have their endings. But the Acts of the Apostles is different. Many questions are left unanswered and unsolved. What happened to Paul? How did his work end? These things are not recorded in Acts. The reason for their absence is that the Holy Spirit is still working today. In the church today, there is still the work of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Submitting to Authority and<br />Receiving the Riches of the Members</h2><p>God's work today is the recovery of the testimony of the Body. This Body testimony is not a doctrine, but a reality. In this Body there is the perfecting ministry (Eph. 4:12) and there is spiritual authority. A close relationship exists between ministry and authority. Where there is ministry, there is authority. In fact, ministry is authority. In Ephesians 4 we see that the Body requires all kinds of gifts, the goal of which is the perfecting of all the saints. In order for the members to be perfected, there is the need to submit to authority. Submitting to authority is submitting to the Head. Today the sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers. Actually, everyone should cover his head with respect to Christ. We do not have individual heads; only Christ is the Head. Those who want to retain their heads are trying to practice individualism. Those who promote individualism in the Body are troublemakers. Only Christ is the Head. Nevertheless, Christ covers His head before God. Although my hands and my feet are far away from my head, they are still under the direction of my head. Hence, for us to submit to the members is in reality for us to submit to the Head.</p><p>The mouth may be very important, but it still needs help from the other members. Without the eyes and the ears, the mouth alone is useless. This is why I do not believe in so-called personal revelation. In the Bible there are such things as individuals receiving grace from the Lord, and there are such things as individuals being sanctified. Yet at the same time, there is the aspect of our relationship with the other members. What do we have today that is not received from others? The greatest heresies in the world came from those who received so-called direct revelations from the Lord. If an individual could receive revelation alone, then a person would need only to be an individual Christian; there would be no need for us to come together to meet any longer, and all the "one another''s, the "we''s, and the "they''s in the Bible could be cut out. A man has to humble himself and receive what others have already received. When a person has received something, it is much easier for another to receive from this one. For example, twenty years ago it was difficult to find a person who was clear about his salvation. But after we met one person who was, it became easier to meet more. This is true with the understanding of the truth of salvation. It is equally true with the understanding of all the other truths.</p><h2 class="head1">A STANDARD CHRISTIAN BEING<br />ONE WHO BEARS THE BODY TESTIMONY</h2><p>The Bible reveals one great truth: The kind of Christian God wants is one who is after a Body testimony. In other words He wants Christians who will act as members of the one Body of Christ. What we need today are standard Christians. What does it mean to be a standard Christian? A standard Christian is one in whom others can detect certain characteristics. For example, when you sit down with a Presbyterian, he will tell you about God's predestination and will tell you that salvation, regeneration, and justification are all based on God's predestination. However, if you sit down with a Methodist, he will tell you that everyone has to work out his own salvation, that repentance is an act of one's free will, and that salvation is a result of one's willingness to be saved. Everything depends on ourselves; if we do not do anything, we cannot even be saved. Among certain kinds of Christians, you can find certain kinds of characteristics.</p><p>Christians today are not standard. They lack a few basic characteristics, such as selling their possessions, consecrating themselves, repentance and confession of sins, and experiences of deliverance from the power of sin. In addition, there is one characteristic that is lacking the most among them, which is the realization of the Body of Christ. We have to help the believers to experience these things as soon as we can. A newly saved person will do whatever you tell him to do at the initial stage of salvation. If he is allowed to go on for too long, he will become set, and it will become difficult to deal with him. Hence, we have to speak to the believers some of these truths as soon as possible. Everyone likes to be nice and to say nice words; everyone likes to be polite to one another. But a person cannot be an up-to-standard Christian this way. In the future we have to spend much time to study how to be a standard Christian so that our next generation can become a brand-new breed of Christians.</p><h2 class="head2">Having the Reality of the Body of Christ<br />and Experiencing It</h2><p>The Body is not a doctrine, but a spiritual fact. If a spiritual matter is recovered, and it is real, it will surely be felt by others. This was the case with the release of the kingdom truth by Evan Roberts. He was sick for a long time. Later, he began to realize the truth concerning the kingdom. When he stood up to speak, the message may have been only fifteen minutes long, but there was something real in what he said. Before him, there were people who spoke about the truth of the kingdom, but the reality was not there. The same is true today with regard to the truth concerning the Body. Many people are able to speak about the Body, but they do not have the Body itself. Before Darby, many people preached this truth, but they did not have the thing itself. When Darby came, it was different; not only did he speak about the truth, but he presented before men the real thing that is conveyed by the truth.</p><h2 class="head2">A Believer Dropping What He Is Holding,<br />and Experiencing What<br />He Has Received Positionally</h2><p>Does this mean that God is restricted by man? Of course not. If God wants to work, He will not be restricted. What a Christian receives on the day of salvation is the most that he will receive. What happens afterward is that these riches are gradually lost. Why are they lost? It is because such a one picks up many other things along the pathway of being a Christian. Both of his hands are full, and he has no capacity to receive anything more. This is the case with an individual, but the same is true with the church as a whole. The book of Ephesians describes the height of the attainment of the church. After that, things began to fall below that standard.</p><p>What a believer has received initially is something positional only. Afterward, he begins to receive something experiential. However, in order to receive something experiential, he must first drop some other things. We must drop what we have in our hands before we can gain something more in our experience. When we leave this world one day, we will be able to say that all our losses were actually gains. Today the believers must catch up with God's work and go on with Him; they should not be ones who are falling back.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE BODY<br />AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 10, 1948, 9:00 a.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE TRUTH</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Arranging the Sequence of Truth<br />according to One's Personal Experience</h2><p>Questions: Do we first know the individual life and then the Body life? Is the basis of the Body life the individual life? Is individualism a hindrance to the Body?</p><p>Brother Nee: At the time of the Reformation, Luther emphasized justification by faith. That was, of course, a recovery of the truth. However, at that time men only saw that faith before God is needed, rather than work. Luther was supposed to have recovered the truth of justification by faith. Actually, he only emphasized faith; he did not fully realize what justification is. It was not until men like J. N. Darby were raised up in the last century that justification was covered. Even though the word "justification'' was used, they had not touched the reality of justification. They did not know what, in fact, is justification. In spite of this, they spoke much on the truth of justification.</p><p>In the last century some people also began to talk about the doctrine of regeneration. But what is the relationship between regeneration and justification? It is difficult to say which one comes first and which one comes later. There was a brother who once preached the doctrine of justification unceasingly; he had never heard of the doctrine of regeneration. After three years he began to hear about the doctrine of regeneration, and he realized that he was regenerated. From that time on, whenever he preached the gospel, he would always tell others that a man is justified and then regenerated. Not only was he preaching this, but all the people around him began to preach the same thing. Actually, for a person to say that justification always comes first and then regeneration is making too definite and too subjective a distinction.</p><p>A person who has no experience cannot preach God's word. But a person who only trusts in his experience cannot preach God's word either. A person who preaches God's word must be free from the limitation of his own experience. It is possible for a person to experience certain truths according to a certain sequence in time. But he must never think that the order of the truths is necessarily according to the way he experiences them.</p><h2 class="head2">The Two Sides of the Truth</h2><p>There are two sides to the truth. Many times, some doctrines only cover one side of the truth. For example, we know that there are two aspects to the result of the cross. On the one hand, it removes our sins (Col. 2:14). On the other hand, it justifies us (Rom. 8:3-4). But we cannot say that the cross is clearly divided into these two things. They are actually two aspects of one thing. We are actually justified from sin through the cross. We who are dead have been freed from sin and justified from sin. This does not mean that being delivered from sin is one thing and being free is another thing. Neither does it mean that being delivered from sin is one thing and justification is another thing.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Sacrificing God's Word<br />on account of Our Own Experience</h2><p>We often sacrifice God's word on account of our personal experiences. Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word. Men think that the sun comes out in the day and the moon comes out at night. They think that the moon only appears at night and disappears in the daytime. Actually, the moon is there in the daytime and at night as well. When a person comes to God, he often makes judgments based on his own experiences. Most people like to arrange the truth in a sequence, such as putting justification first and sanctification afterward. Yet the Bible puts sanctification before justification (1 Cor. 6:11). Actually, justification and sanctification are two sides of one truth.</p><p>Hence, we need to be delivered from human weaknesses. One cannot affect or sacrifice God's word on account of human weaknesses. Not only should we be delivered from doubting God's word; we must also be delivered from jeopardizing God's word. Under God's ordering, our knowledge of the individual life and our knowledge of the Body life should happen at the same time; we should not say which one comes first and which one comes later.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Taking What We See Today<br />as the Whole Truth</h2><p>We cannot judge God's word by what we see in this age. What we see today is still limited. Perhaps fifty years from now, other brothers will rise up to say that we are in darkness. We only wish we could climb higher than we are to see God's word. Just as we are not saved and then regenerated, in the same way we do not first receive an individual life and then come to realize the Body life. Just as salvation and regeneration happen at the same time, the realization of the individual life and the Body life happen at the same time (Acts 9:17-18). In every age there are truths of that age. There are also errors of that age. We cannot make the truth of an age become an error just because we do not have enough knowledge about that truth. Take again the example of baptism and the laying on of hands. The two things should happen at the same time. After a person is baptized, he should immediately experience the laying on of hands, and he should immediately be brought to see the coordination, the Body, and be joined to the brothers and sisters. Due to the fact that some truths were recovered first and some later, men set a sequence to the order of the truth. This is wrong. This is why we cannot consider what we have seen today as the whole truth, nor can we judge God's word by our own experience. Never forget that we are ministers of God's word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for a Clear Vision of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The oneness of the Body is based on the knowledge of the life of the Body. First, we have to see that we have received the same life. After this seeing, we become one in this life. Without this seeing, we have a big lack. A person who has not seen the Body will feel that he is not much different from a person who has seen the Body. But a person who has seen the Body will realize that there is a big lack with those who have not seen the Body. This is like an unsaved person considering a saved person to be more or less the same as he is. Yet the saved person sees a big lack in the unsaved person.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE PRACTICE</h2><h2 class="head2">Finding the Ones to Submit To</h2><p>After we have such a realization, we come to the second step. The first step has to do with God's word. The second step has to do with us. First, we must have God's word. Then this word must be applied to us. In the Body the first thing we have to learn is to find those whom we have to submit ourselves to. We must know those who are ahead of us. All the authorities in the Bible are deputy authorities and not direct authorities. What we have to learn is not to have others submit to us, but to submit ourselves to others. When I go to work, I do not first ask who my subordinates are. Rather, I must first ask who my superior is. If you go to another person's house to be the maid, you do not first ask who the children are, but who the lady of the house is. If we allow the inner life to operate freely, we will find the ones whom we have to submit to. We may think that submission will make us unhappy. Actually, the opposite is true; submission makes a happy person, and insubordination makes an unhappy person. Only when we submit to one another will there be coordination one with another. This kind of coordination is most pleasant. The real submission is not one that is imposed from without, but one that comes as a result of the operation of the life within. It is wrong to submit to anyone because of his high position or material riches. To do so would make us no different from today's political organizations. Our submission is not brought about by any outward factors, but by the demand of the life within.</p><p>This kind of submission may bring us tears. Yet, at the same time it brings us joy. We may feel that we are suffering, but at the same time, we are rejoicing. Sometimes the ones whom you submit to may give you a hard time, but you can still say "amen.'' This is true submission. True submission neither makes a person suffer nor causes him to feel happy. However, it draws an "amen'' from his spirit and gives him peace in his spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping and Coordinating Together</h2><p>If we see the Body of Christ, we will see the matter of fellowship. The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together. In this coordination there is no friction and there is no murmuring. To have such things in the Body would make us no different from the political organizations in the world.</p><p>In the Bible the Lord often did not speak to men directly. On the one hand, the New Testament says that a man can know God from within. On the other hand, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him directly. Instead, He asked Ananias to go to speak to Saul (Acts 9:6). On the one hand, the life that is seen in the New Testament is a very personal one. On the other hand, the Epistle of John says that "you also may have fellowship with us'' (1 John 1:3). This fellowship is mutual. On the one hand, we come to God individually by the blood and through the veil. On the other hand, we work together, walk together, coordinate together, and serve together. There are those who serve, and there are those who are served. From the records concerning Paul, Luke, Timothy, and others, we see that among them there was coordination. Whatever Paul suggested, the others would agree and carry it out right away. Timothy was a good brother. He could have written a letter to Paul, saying, "Brother Paul, I have believed in the Lord for many years. I can pray, and I can seek after the Lord. Please give me some liberty!'' But Timothy did not do this. On the one hand, every person comes to God independently and is individually responsible to God. On the other hand, no one can be independent, and no one can be free. If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from the Self</h2><p>A man's mouth may be very clever, but his mouth does not necessarily represent his person. Sometimes, a person may say "yes'' with his mouth, yet disagree within. Some brothers and sisters only bring their mouths to the meetings; they themselves are not in the meetings. One sister once came to me to discuss the question of submission in the family. Her mouth was saying that she wanted me to handle the matter. But I knew clearly within me that her mouth and her ears had come, but that her being had not come. Once a person has given up his personal opinions, even though he may not readily consent with his mouth, he will acknowledge within that this is the right thing to do.</p><p>We have to learn to be persons who are delivered from ourselves. If fifty radios are receiving the same signal from a station, and my radio receives a different signal from the same station, my radio is definitely not functioning properly. Although we live under the New Testament and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body. Therefore, there is the need for us to be joined to the other members. In the coordination of the Body, we have to learn to care for the feeling of the other members of the Body. Only then can we have good coordination.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being Individualistic</h2><p>The body is the most beautiful thing there is on earth. Yet the body can also become the most ugly thing on earth. A man looks very fine if he stands here with all his members attached. But if all I saw were isolated members detached one from the other, this would be the most ugly sight. If I came into this house and saw two feet at the door, a pair of ears in the room, and a pair of arms at the stairs, how horrible this sight would be! I would surely run away at once. In the same way, if a person acts independently and is not joined to the Body, he will become a very ugly member. It is one thing for a person to acknowledge that he is a member. It is another thing for this person to be coordinated as a member. Independent actions in the Body are the ugliest things there are.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission to the Authority of the Ministry</h2><h2 class="head3">Ministry Being the Authority</h2><p>Authority is related to the Head. Authority is also related to ministry. Please remember that all the members have their special gifts. The ears, the eyes, the mouth, the hands, and the feet all have their gifts. These gifts are the ministries. As long as there is the ministry, there is authority. Why does the ministry have authority? It is because each member receives different ministries. The difference in ministries produces authority. At the same time, with the authority in the ministry there are the limitations. God may grant grace to me to be an ear and to enable me to hear. On the one hand, He intends that I serve the Body with my hearing. On the other hand, He intends that I accept my own limitations. If I want to see, I have to ask the eyes to help me. The problem today is that those who cannot hear insist that they want to hear, those who cannot speak insist that they have to speak, and those who cannot run insist that they have to run. We have to realize that for others to do something is equal to our doing the same thing. Their gift is our gift. At the same time, we have to learn to be limited and to realize that the church is a Body.</p><h2 class="head3">The Need to See One's Limitations</h2><p>Some people simply do not know how to study the Bible or teach the Bible. Yet they insist that they have to do it, and the result is many problems. If the Lord is gracious to you and He makes you a hand, you can raise up this hand as high as you want. But if you say that in addition to being a hand, you want to see also, you will not succeed even if you try it as long as you live. You should pray, "Lord, cause me to see my limitations.'' If you were all-inclusive, then you would become the whole Body. The acceptance of our own limitations is a principle of coordination, and it is also the greatest test. Those who realize their own limitations will fellowship in everything and will seek help and counsel in everything.</p><p>We must realize that authority is in the ministry. The ear has a ministry of hearing. Hence, the ear has the authority of hearing. If we do not see our own limitations, we will not be able to submit to authority even if we want to. Only those who have seen their own limitations can coordinate with other members.</p><p>Some brothers think that they can expound the Bible. They think that they are Bible expositors. Actually, they do not know how to expound the Bible. Yet they insist that they have to do it. The result is many strange teachings. With a Christian there is not much difference between the self and the individual life.</p><p>Some people never understand what Paul meant when he said that "all are yours'' (1 Cor. 3:22). We have to realize that we were born into a rich family. We can rejoice because we are rich. Within us there is always the feeling that we should accept authority. Our inner man always wants to submit and accept the authority of the ministry. On the one hand, we have to see our limitations. On the other hand, we have to see that whatever the Lord has established is an authority. It is the Lord who gives some the ability to do something. That ability is that person's authority.</p><h2 class="head3">Submission to the Ministry<br />Being Submission to God</h2><p>While we are learning to submit to the ministry, we are submitting to God. A person cannot say that he will only submit to God directly. Of all the authorities that God has established on this earth, ninety-nine percent of them, that is, the overwhelming majority of them, are deputy authorities. The Bible says that we have to submit to our husband and our rulers, and the younger ones have to submit to the older ones. Other than one or two instances, all the cases of submission are submission to deputy authorities. Those who cannot submit to deputy authorities cannot submit to God. Although the eyes see, it is actually the head that is causing the eyes to see. If the eyes are separated from the head, they are finished. What we touch may be the eyes, but behind the eyes is the head. If we see the Head behind the gifts, it is not difficult for us to submit.</p><h2 class="head3">Submission Being a Joyful Matter</h2><p>The teachings in the sermon on the mount in Matthew are not there to cause us to feel uncomfortable. Rather, they are there to make us happy. If we walk with others for a mile, it may make us feel uncomfortable. But if we walk with them the second mile, it will make us happy. The word blessed can be translated as "joyous.'' Submission is a joyful matter. The life that the Lord gave us is a joyful life. The Head gives the ministry. Where there is the ministry, there is the authority. When we submit to authority, we feel happy and joyful within.</p><h2 class="head3">Pursuing Submission</h2><p>In the work of the Lord we should find out who is ahead of us and then seek for the opportunity to submit. I do not believe that there is any brother who is not under some other brothers. Something within you will demand that you find out who is the object of your submission. When the sisters cover their heads, they cannot do so with the hair that grows naturally from them; they have to find a handkerchief to cover their heads. The finding of the handkerchief means that a person has to pursue submission. Why should we not pursue submission in the same way that we pursue love or knowledge? Why would men not pay attention to submission in the same way that they pay attention to work? Why would we not love submission in the same way that we love the preaching of the gospel? A person has to learn to come under one or more authorities in the church. Let me repeat, where there is no ministry, there is no authority. Where there is ministry, there is authority.</p><h2 class="head3">Honoring the Authority That God Has Established</h2><p>In a local church, not only is there spiritual authority, but there is also positional authority. Paul charged Titus and Timothy to appoint elders. These elders have positional authority. If you do not have the spiritual discernment and you appoint three elders, and after three years you find out that four other people are more advanced than these three, what should you do? Should you replace the old ones with the new ones? Should you ask the old ones to resign? We should honor all the authorities that God has established according to His will.</p><h2 class="head3">Submission Perfecting Ourselves and Others</h2><p>I can testify that God has His arrangements in the church. If you go along with these arrangements, these arrangements will perfect you. Ministry is authority. When you submit to the authority of the ministry, you will be perfected. One sister was very capable of assuming headship. She came to see me because she wanted to submit to her husband. She told me that she could not submit to her husband, because her husband was indecisive in everything. I answered, "Nevertheless, simply submit. Go and ask him everything. He cannot tell you every time that he does not know. By asking, you will force him to go to the Lord. You should learn to be godly and to fear God. When you submit, you are not debasing yourself. Rather, you are helping your husband. God has assigned you to be one who submits to others. If you would submit, you will help others.'' There is a reason for our being chosen: we are chosen to submit to others.</p><p>Paul could boldly say "my gospel'' (Rom. 2:16; 16:25). He could also remind Timothy to know "from which ones you have learned'' (2 Tim. 3:14). He could say this because he was a proper apostle and he had the greatest ministry and the greatest gifts. Hence, he had the authority to remind others concerning his gospel, his ministry, and his teachings.</p><h2 class="head3">Submission Bringing In<br />the Building of the Church</h2><p>A person must put himself under a few persons and submit to them. In this way, not only will he receive the benefit individually, but the church will also receive the benefit. A member in the Body is like a stone in the temple. The temple was built up because there were suitable stones that were coordinated and built up together. Building means that one stone is laid on top of another, and desolation means that no stone is laid on top of another.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF THE WORK TODAY</h2><h2 class="head2">Going On with the Lord</h2><p>The Lord is going on. What we considered as life yesterday may be death today. We must go on, and we must not stop at past experiences. I believe that the Lord is doing a greater and richer work today than yesterday. All those who have their eyes opened will see that we are living in the richest age. Yet these riches are accumulated amidst desolation. On the one hand, the church is advancing and progressing. On the other hand, the church is in an age of desolation. Some only see the desolation of the church and do not see the advance of the church. Others only see the advance of the church and do not see the desolation of the church. From the view of the Lord's work today, we can say that the Lord is advancing. But at the same time, when we consider everything around us, we can also say that the church is desolate.</p><h2 class="head2">The Testimony of the Local Church<br />in an Age of Desolation</h2><p>God is raising up the testimony of the local church today in the midst of desolation to answer His call in an age of desolation and to recover the church out of its desolation through the testimony of the local church. Christianity has been deformed and has fallen into desolation. Therefore, Christians today are no longer typical. They have not come up to God's standard. A typical Christian is not only one who is a Christian individually, but one who is involved in the testimony of the church. Only the testimony of the church can bring the church back from desolation to abundance.</p><h2 class="head2">Maintaining the Lord's Testimony<br />with the Ministry of the Church</h2><p>The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working'' (John 5:17). The Father is always working; He never stops. For this reason we are also working today. Our work today is to secure for the Lord a testimony of the local church. Our ministry today is the ministry of the church, which is one that brings in a testimony of the church for the Lord.</p><p>Today the church is in a state of desolation. According to typology the church has been captured to Babylon. The thriving condition of the church as seen by Paul in the first century was lost soon afterward. From that time, the church fell into a state of captivity, which continued until the time of Thyatira. After Thyatira, there was Sardis, where God began His work. Thyatira typifies Roman Catholicism, and Sardis typifies Protestantism. God began His recovery work at the time of Sardis. Although the truths were buried for such a long time, when they were recovered, they immediately became actualities. When Paul spoke concerning the truths in the first century, those truths were spiritual realities, yet they were not actualities. For example, when he spoke about the church, it was a reality, but the actual church had not appeared yet. After the Reformation, not only were the truths recovered, but the actual things themselves were recovered. For example, justification by faith is no longer just a truth; it has become an actual thing. If the Lord delays His coming, the church will no longer exhort men to be justified by works. The actual matter of justification by faith has been recovered in the church.</p><p>What the church needs today is to raise up a ministry that will maintain the Lord's testimony. The problem with all the places today is that we only maintain a local church without maintaining a ministry that is for the Lord's testimony. Today's ministry must match God's work. We cannot merely have a so-called ministry. We must have a ministry that is a proper testimony. Our ministry must be the ministry of the church, a ministry that is a testimony of the church.</p><p>God's ministry today is in the local church and for the local church. The work of the ministry is to recover the proper testimony of the church. This is the real recovery. The unique ministry is for the unique testimony, and the content of the unique testimony is fulfilled in the local church.</p><h2 class="head2">Expressing the Reality of Christ's Body<br />in the Local Church</h2><p>These are not ordinary days. Our works today are not ordinary works. The way today is the way of the church. In this way we must not act presumptuously or carelessly. Once we act carelessly, the Lord will have no way to go on. The Body described in 1 Corinthians 12 is a testimony that a local church should have; it is the testimony of the Body. In this Body the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you'' (v. 21). Every part must be in coordination. Ephesians 4 reveals to us the reality between the Head and the Body. The local church today must be a testimony that expresses the reality of this Body. It must be a practical and actual Body expressed in a locality.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WAY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 11, 1948, Lord's Day afternoon<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle and the Temple<br />Typifying Two Aspects of the Church</h2><p>Concerning the question of the desolation of the church, we must first consider the way of the church on earth. The way of the church on earth can be seen from the history of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was set up by God. The purpose of the tabernacle was for God to dwell with His people Israel (Exo. 25:8). There are many basic differences between the temple and the tabernacle. In the beginning God dwelt in the tabernacle. After the temple was finished, God began to dwell in the temple (1 Kings 9:3). Both the tabernacle and the temple typify God's dwelling among men. The two appear to be repetitions in type. Actually, they are not repetitions. In the past many people have written books concerning the tabernacle as a type. But few books have been written concerning the temple as a type. Actually, both are types of the church. Yet there are some basic differences between the two.</p><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle in the Wilderness<br />Being Temporary and Movable,<br />whereas the Temple in the Holy Land<br />Being Eternal and Stable</h2><p>The tabernacle was built in the wilderness under the direction of Moses and Aaron. The temple was prepared by David and completed by Solomon in Jerusalem. The tabernacle did not have a floor. It had a cover and curtains. When a person entered the tabernacle, his feet touched the sand on the ground, reminding him that the tabernacle was something transitory and movable. This is why it was called the tabernacle, or "the tent of meeting.''</p><p>The temple had many similarities to the tabernacle. In the tabernacle, there were gold, silver, brass, and iron. In the temple there were the wood and the stones. The stones were a crucial material. In the New Testament the Lord called Peter, Cephas (John 1:42). The word Cephas means a stone. In the tabernacle there was no stone. Stones are immovable; they signify stability and solidarity. The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness; it was transitory in nature. The temple was designed for the kingdom; it was eternal in nature. David represents the Lord, and Solomon represents the Holy Spirit. The meaning of Solomon is the One who brings in peace. God sent the Holy Spirit of peace to build up the temple. David is a type of the incarnated Christ, and Solomon is a type of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle Typifying God's Church on Earth,<br />whereas the Temple Typifying the Church<br />as Christ's Unique Body</h2><p>In the Bible there are always two aspects to God's habitation. On the one hand, it is transitory and wandering, typified by the tabernacle. The tabernacle moved as the people traveled along. Sometimes it was in Elim. At other times it was in Kadesh-barnea. Sometimes it was in the land of supply. At other times it was in the land of bitter water. However, the tabernacle itself did not change with a change of location. Wherever the Israelites pitched their tents, there was the tabernacle. Hence, the tabernacle typifies God's church on earth, or His church in the localities. In Shanghai there is the church, because in Shanghai there are God's people. Whenever God's people come together, there is the church. When they are separated, there is no church. This is the aspect of the church as typified by the tabernacle.</p><p>The temple was different from the tabernacle. The temple was established on the threshingfloor of Ornan (2 Chron. 3:1) and built with stones. It was built for the kingdom. It was the center of the life of the people of Israel. The temple was unique, eternal, and solid, and it could not be divided. Even when the nation was divided politically, the temple could not be divided. There could be only one temple.</p><p>From this we see that, on the one hand, the church appears in different localities. Yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body. It is unique and eternal. These are the two pictures of the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle Being in Ruins<br />and the Ark Wandering,<br />Typifying the Desolation of the Church</h2><p>The visible church today is the tabernacle; it is already in ruins. At the same time, the temple is not yet manifested. In God's eyes the church described in Ephesians 2 as God's habitation in the Holy Spirit is a fact. But in actuality the church has not been fully manifested yet; it is still in its progressing stage. In 1924 we spoke of the history of the ark. The ark of the covenant was always advancing. First, it passed through the river Jordan. Then it reached Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). At the time the Israelites went to war with the Philistines, the two sons of Eli had sinned and Eli himself had become foolish and corrupt. He well knew the reason the Israelites were defeated. Yet he still tried to use the ark to fight for them with the hope that they would win the victory through the ark. But the Israelites failed. The ark was captured to the land of the Philistines, and it remained in the house of Dagon (1 Sam. 5:2). Later, God brought in a curse, and the Philistines returned the ark on a cart drawn by cows (chs. 4&mdash;6).</p><p>At that time Samuel was raised up to fulfill his ministry. He was still a child and was girded with a small ephod (2:18). Here was a minister who was set apart for the kingdom. The ark represents Christ. Wherever the ark was, there was the presence of Christ. The ark was known as the ark of the testimony. It was the center of God's testimony. Without the ark, the tabernacle was empty. The tabernacle was meaningful only when it had the ark inside it. After the ark was taken away from the tabernacle in Shiloh (4:17), it never returned to the tabernacle. It continued to wander, until it was received into the temple when the temple was finished (1 Kings 8:1-11). Before David, there was Saul. At that time Shiloh had already been rejected. The ark did not return to the tabernacle, but remained in the house of Obed-edom until the time of David (2 Sam. 6:10), when David welcomed the ark into Jerusalem (vv. 12-15). Jeremiah 7:12 and 14 speak of how God dealt with Shiloh, and Psalm 78:60 and 1 Samuel 4:3 speak of how the ark had left the tabernacle. Second Chronicles 5 speaks of how the ark was returned to the temple. God did not deal with Shiloh in the way of burning it down with fire, nor in the way of destroying the people there, but by removing the ark. Having a tabernacle without an ark&mdash;this is judgment, desolation, and punishment. Shiloh had the outward form of the tabernacle only; the ark was no longer there. It is like Christianity having only the name of the church, but the central testimony of the church has been lost, and God's testimony has been removed.</p><p>When Solomon became king, he went to Gibeon to pray for wisdom in the tabernacle. Later, when he received the wisdom, he went to the ark (1 Kings 3:15). However, according to 1 Kings 3:4 and 2 Chronicles 1:3, the Gibeonites still made sacrifices and sought for God at the tabernacle. But from the day Solomon left the tabernacle, he never went back. Although in Gibeon there was still the outward, human worship, those who had received wisdom would never go back to the tabernacle. Those who had received wisdom went with the ark.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Normal Condition of the Church<br />at the Beginning&mdash;Bearing a Testimony<br />of Oneness in All the Places</h2><p>The church on earth today is one. Those who are in the church are men who are separated from the world. Under normal circumstances every brother and sister should be serving God; this should be their proper occupation. Every one should be a consecrated one, and everyone should have everything in common. Under such a proper living, the gifted ministries such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, as listed in Ephesians 4, are produced. Although these gifted ones are scattered in different places, they are still in the same church. This is like the electric current being one, yet transmitted throughout many places. Although the intensity of light may be different from one house to the other, the electricity itself is one. The light expressed in different places is different, but the nature of the electricity is the same. It is the same with the church. Although the churches in various localities are different as far as their localities are concerned, there is nevertheless only one church. The church exists for the testimony of oneness. When we say the "local church,'' our emphasis is the church, not the localness. The life that all the churches possess is a life of oneness. For this reason all the churches should be one among themselves. Although there were the manifested churches in Corinth, Ephesus, and other places, they were all one church. This is the normal situation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Desolation of the Church</h2><p>However, when the church became desolate, conditions changed. At the time of Paul the church was already falling into desolation. Paul said in the book of Philippians that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus'' (2:21). In 2 Timothy he said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him and his ministry (1:15). The descriptions in Peter's Epistles are no exception; they all mention the desolation of the church toward the end of the apostles' time. On the one hand, Peter spoke in his first Epistle of the church as a spiritual house or a spiritual temple (2:5). On the other hand, Peter also spoke of the condition of degradation. John's Epistles spoke of the coming of antichrist and of apostasy in teachings (1 John 2:18; 4:3; 2 John 7). These are the conditions of the end times. In Revelation 2 and 3 we see that the churches had become so desolate that the Lord could no longer write to the churches; He could only write to the messengers of the churches. The letter to Ephesus in Revelation 2 can be considered as "The Second Epistle to the Ephesians.'' There the church had forsaken its original condition and had drifted farther and farther away.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Eyes upon the Spiritual Reality<br />of the Church in the Age of Its Desolation</h2><p>What we see today is merely a collection of human methods, doctrines, opinions, criticisms, and quibbles. Amidst the desolation of the church, we need to learn to exercise judgment. It is true that among all the denominations in Christianity, there are God's people who are still performing worship to God. We have to admit that there are still sacrifices. But the ark is no longer there. There is no more testimony. The only thing that is left is an outward tabernacle. When God's tabernacle has become desolate, His eyes are turned to the temple. Today we who are learning to follow the Lord have to make a choice between the tabernacle and the temple. Some like to follow what is on hand, what is visible, and what is available everywhere. Yet those who want to follow God have to choose the ark and go on with it.</p><p>The position that we should take should be one of spiritual reality, that is, the position typified by the temple. Today the church is the habitation of the Holy Spirit. In this church there is God's authority and the desire of God's heart. There is also the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord has given the church the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. As such, we can enjoy the power of the coming age in the church today. In the Old Testament the temple and the kingdom are linked together; the temple is the most crucial element in the kingdom. In the same way the church as the temple is linked to the power of the coming kingdom. This is where our way lies today. On the one hand, we have to leave the outward tabernacle, and on the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony. God has pronounced very clear judgment on the outward failures. His judgment is His removal of the ark. Before God, being without the ark is a shame. On the one hand, we have to leave the tabernacle, and on the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony.</p><p>What is God's testimony? In the Old Testament God ordered Moses to make two tables of stones, which were called the tables of the law. The Ten Commandments were engraved on these stones. The tables of the law were also called the tables of testimony (Exo. 34:29). The ark that God commanded Moses to make was a type of Christ. Above the ark was the mercy seat. Within the ark was the law. However, God did not call the ark the ark of the law, but the ark of the testimony (25:22). Hence, the law is God's testimony.</p><p>The law is God's demand on man's conduct. How then can it be God's testimony? On the one hand, we have to realize that God's testimony is the response of God's demand on man. On the other hand, God's demand is simply God's testimony. Where there are the divine demands, there is the divine testimony. Whatever demands God puts on man today, they attest to God and testify of God. They testify of God's glory, His holiness, and all that He is. The law declares God's demands, and the mercy seat bestows God's grace to man. The testimony is from man to God, and grace is from God to man. When God's glory is satisfied, there is the mercy seat. We have to know that the Ten Commandments do not refer to the dead laws, but to God's demand on man. This demand is itself a testimony, in which God testifies of Himself. The law maintains God's testimony, and it testifies for God. God has to explain His demands to man, and this explanation is God's testimony. Psalm 119 repeatedly describes God's law as His testimony. When a man keeps God's law, he is keeping God's testimony. Every time the word testimony is used in Psalm 119, it refers to the law.</p><p>Today the outward church has become weakened and has failed. It has lost the testimony of God and is not able to meet God's demand. For this reason, there is disunity, divisions, denominations, and sects. God demands that man submit, but man cannot meet this demand. As a result the testimony is lost, and division is produced. Although every revivalist comes along and builds a tabernacle, there is no ark of testimony in it. Even when there is a mercy seat, there is no ark. A man can go to different places to conduct conferences. However, he is merely moving the tabernacle from one place to another. He is merely maintaining a mercy seat without an ark. Although the ark is not there, the mercy seat is nevertheless put up. This is what men are doing today&mdash;replacing God's testimony with man's need. Whenever man's need replaces God's testimony, degradation begins and problems arise. What then is the way for our work today?</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR OUR WORK TODAY</h2><h2 class="head2">Realizing the Limitation of an Individual<br />and Being Delivered from Individualism</h2><p>God has His specific demands; He wants man to learn coordination. God not only requires that man be delivered from sin, the world, and the flesh; He also asks that man be delivered from his individualism. With regard to the knowledge of the Body of Christ, man's problem lies in the fact that from the first day he has been taught the wrong things. Since the Reformation, man has thought that he can be a Christian individually, that he can be sanctified individually, justified individually, and work and serve God individually. From the very beginning this realization has been wrong, and the way a person takes subsequent to this is also wrong. Man thinks that as soon as he believes in the Lord, he only has to be zealous, to consecrate himself, and to give up everything. However, a man must realize that he is not only a man of unclean lips, but that he also dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips (Isa. 6:5). While it is wrong to have unclean lips individually, it is equally wrong to dwell in the midst of a people with unclean lips.</p><p>If we lay a good foundation today, the situation will change drastically within twenty or thirty years. We must see that a person cannot be a proper Christian individually; he must follow the footsteps of the flock, and he must never hold on to any form of individualism. After a person is saved, he must immediately be brought to see that he belongs to the Body. Being joined to the Body is the meaning of the laying on of hands. When a new believer is joined to the Body through the laying on of hands, he can no longer be an individual Christian.</p><p>We must be brought to a point where we acknowledge the limitation of the individual. This word is easy for the young ones, but it is difficult for those with considerable gifts. However, we must see that even members as great as the hands and the feet are but hands and feet only; they must accept the other members before they can become complete. We must recognize our own limitations. Problems arise in the church because some people think that they are all-inclusive; they want to do everything by themselves. However, the hand can only be the hand. It cannot see, and it cannot hear. It has to accept the seeing and the hearing of others before it can enjoy the riches. It does not matter how great a gift I am; in many areas I have to accept the supply of others. Some can only be cells. Surely they need others. The question is whether or not they would ask others to help them. Their basic need is to acknowledge their own limitations. They have to acknowledge that they cannot see, speak, or hear.</p><p>We have to clearly identify our own limitations. We may not know something, but there are others in the church who will know. The fact that I do not know something does not mean that everyone else does not know about it. I have to live by others. I may not be able to walk, but others can walk. Never think that we can preach the Head without preaching the Body. The more we depend on the Lord, the more we will realize that we have to depend on the members. If we do not accept our own limitations, we will never find the way that others have opened up already. As long as the question of limitation is not resolved, we can never advance. What we have individually is very little. We should not think that we are so capable or clever, and we should not think that we will never be wrong and that others are always wrong. We all have to humble ourselves and be delivered from our pride and our individualism to receive the supply from others. Those who are accustomed to their cleverness and who think highly of themselves should make a turn and have a change. This is the first point.</p><h2 class="head2">Submitting to the Authority of the Ministry</h2><p>Second, not only do we have to acknowledge our own limitations; we have to know submission. In the Body of Christ, ministry means authority. Whoever can hear and speak is the authority. If a member can see, he is the authority. His ability to see is his authority. If a member can hear, his ability to hear is the authority. If you want to hear something, you have to submit to him. Either you walk blindly, or you have to submit to the eyes for your seeing. There is no one in the church who does not have to submit to someone; everyone has to submit to those assigned by God. The problem today is that many brothers and sisters think that the supply others have received will not work in them. They think that they have to receive something directly from God. Man thinks that he can do without man's preaching, but God's commandments come through His ministers. For this reason, we must learn to submit.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being Interested in Interfering with Others,<br />but Always Seeking Help from Others</h2><p>A minister cannot speak in a loose way, nor can he demand that others submit to him all the time without himself being first dealt with by the Lord. God will never entrust His authority to such people. If a man naturally wants to put his hands on others' business, God will not be able to use such a person. Man has to be like God, who does not like to control everything. If God wanted to control everything, He could have removed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or He could have put a fence around the tower of Babel. He could have removed the fiery sword from the cherubim. But God would not do such things. He does not like to interfere with the liberty of others. Man has to make his own choices. Some brothers and sisters like to interfere with others' affairs. But God has no interest in such things. He never forces anyone to believe. He says, "Every one who believes...would have eternal life'' (John 3:16). Every one who receives has eternal life. He does not force man to believe. If a man has been dealt with by God to such a degree that he no longer likes to interfere with others' business, God will entrust His authority to such a one.</p><p>A man should not have a desire to interfere with another member in the Body. If a man has been taught by God, he will have no desire to interfere with others' affairs. He will also gladly seek advice from others concerning his own affairs. If we practice this, a beautiful Body life will be realized when thousands of members come together, each having no desire to interfere with others' business while gladly seeking advice from others. If we do this, we will be balanced. God has no desire for us to be busybodies.</p><p>We have to be a person who has learned the lessons, and we have to reject and restrict all forms of individualism. On the one hand, we have to accept limitations. On the other hand, we have to learn submission. It is a joyful thing to pursue after submission. Today, in the whole world, in all the nations, and among all the societies there are all kinds of opinions, voices, expressions, and arguments. This is why all organizations have their rules. When they conduct meetings, some are given permission to ask questions whereas others are given permission to answer. Those who speak cannot go on beyond a certain number of minutes. This proves that an individual has to be limited by the group even in the world. Of course, this limitation is an artificial one, not one that is done in submission.</p><h2 class="head2">Submitting to the Arrangement of the Head<br />and Receiving the Riches from the Members</h2><p>The first sin of man was rebellion, lawlessness, and the overthrowing of authority. Satan's fall and rebellion were caused by his uplifting of himself to be above God. If we submit ourselves to God's authority today, we will have the proper testimony. We have to realize that not everyone has the authority and not everyone has the word of God. The testimony of the Body today has nothing to do with numbers; it is a matter of being in the Body. It is a matter of being willing to submit to the arrangement of the Head, as opposed to being free to make one's own choices and decisions. As a member of the Body, we cannot make any decision on our own. Christ has an immeasurably vast deposit in the church today. If we are in a receiving position, we will surely become very rich. If we insist on receiving only from God without receiving from the Body, we will become very poor. This is not a doctrine but a fact. Not only is the thing we have our own, but what the brothers and sisters have is also ours. In many matters other brothers and sisters have a clear discernment, but we do not have discernment. As such, we have to accept the discernment of the brothers and sisters. Some people know God's Word. Some can discern the truth. We should gladly receive their discernment and judgment. What we do not know, someone else will know. If we will not receive from others, probably we will end up fifty years from now having the same as what we have now.</p><p>It is a strange thing that we have to exhort the brothers and sisters to receive from others. On the one hand, men say that they are poor and weak. On the other hand, they are not willing to receive riches from others. Is this not strange? How rich are the ministries that God has raised up in the church today! Yet we are still in hunger. This is because we emphasize our own individualism too much. A man has to learn to bow down his head and to receive supply from others.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Laying On of Hands&mdash;<br />Handing Oneself Over<br />to Accept God's Assigned Authority</h2><p>Receiving the laying on of hands means accepting the judgment of the church. It means that we are willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person. We are responsible for handing ourselves over. In the Old Testament, when men laid their hands on the heads of the goats, it meant that they were willing to hand the goats over to the priests. If they wanted to keep the goats, they should not lay their hands on the goats, because they were not willing to hand the goats over. The Bible says that a man has to come to the altar willingly and offer his sacrifices willingly. God wants man to hand himself over in a voluntary way. The Acts of the Apostles records the matter of baptism; it also records the matter of the laying on of hands. The laying on of hands signifies the acceptance of the authority of the church. Today man sees that baptism is a separation of the believers from the worldly system. But he does not see that the laying on of hands is an acceptance of God's authority that He establishes in the church. When a man refuses authority, confusion results. If a man is willing to hand himself over to the serving ones, it will become easy for the serving ones to do their job.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK&mdash;<br />THE CO-WORKERS HANDING THEMSELVES OVER</h2><p>The principle in the work is the same. The co-workers in all the places should first hand themselves over and place themselves under the Head and be directed by the Head. Only then can the Lord do something, and only then will the work have a way to go on. We hope that in these days the Lord will at least give us a way to go on.</p><p>Henceforth, we have to accept the judgment of the Body. All major decisions and directions must be placed in the hands of the Body. If we do this, we will have life, power, and direction. Otherwise, there will be rebellion and insubordination. If we hand ourselves over, we will surely feel an "amen'' and a sweet sense within us.</p><p>In the past the situation in Foochow has been one of confusion. The meetings there became a little kingdom by themselves. The saints were closed and would not fellowship with others. Their hearts were not broad enough and did not include all the believers; they did not see the unique Body of Christ. The manifestation of the Body in the future will be determined by the nature of the testimony of the local churches today. The local churches are the models of the coming universal church. This is like an architect designing a house: first he builds a model. Although the model is not very big, it represents in nature what will be built. First Corinthians 12 speaks of the universal Body on the one hand and the Body life in the local churches on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OUTLET OF THE WORK&mdash;<br />HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE BODY<br />TO BE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL VESSEL</h2><p>In our work we must find an outlet for the Lord. We are not lacking power today, but we are lacking an outlet for the Lord. The problem among us is that the co-workers have not properly handed themselves over. Although there is a little power, this power is not great. A three-dimensional cup can hold a lot of water. But a flat piece of glass or a broken cup cannot hold any water. Because our work has been "flat,'' we have lost many blessings. The tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament both typify the church in the New Testament, the Body of Christ. Only when this Body becomes a "three-dimensional" Body can it be a vessel of God. Only then can it contain God's riches and be a strong and powerful testimony for the Lord.</p><p>Not only should the co-workers do this, but the brothers and sisters should also consecrate themselves fully in this way. No matter where he or she is, every brother and sister should be a servant of God. All of us need a specific declaration; we should count the cost and hand ourselves over.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK&mdash;<br />FROM THE CENTER TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE</h2><p>The gospel spread from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth. This is God's way. If a man starts working from the ends of the earth, he is taking the wrong direction. We must work from the center to the circumference. At the same time, it would be equally wrong if all the believers were to remain in Jerusalem, because the intention of the Lord was that the gospel would be preached to the ends of the earth. For this reason, the Lord scattered the believers by raising up persecution in the environment. However, it was not wrong for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. There still needed to be apostles and elders in Jerusalem, because Jerusalem was a center of testimony. In addition, Antioch was also a center of testimony. The problem today is that we do not have a Jerusalem and we do not have an Antioch. All we have is simply local churches.</p><p>In the Bible there was definitely a Jerusalem and an Antioch. This is what needs to be recovered among us in these days. Our work today does not seem to have a Jerusalem. In 1937 we saw the ground of the church, but we did not see the light concerning Jerusalem. Nevertheless, we somehow felt then that the work should not belong to a locality. Thank God that He has led us on. What we have seen today is much more than what we saw then. We cannot change any part of God's Word, and we cannot skip any part of His Word. We should never forget that in the Bible there is still a church in Jerusalem.</p><p>Because our light was not adequate in the past, we suffered losses. From now on we must have a fresh start. If we do not do this, the work will belong to the local church again, and the Lord will have no way to go on among us.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: Between 1940 and 1943, by the mercy of the Lord, we did quite a work in Chefoo, Shantung. During those few years many souls were saved, and many consecrated themselves. Of the brothers and sisters who were in Chefoo, ninety percent consecrated themselves. Later, the migration started. Over one hundred people migrated to the northwest of China, and a few dozen migrated to Manchuria. Ninety-five percent of the traveling expenses of these migrating ones were taken care of by the church. In the first three years after we began to have the testimony in Chefoo, about one hundred fifty brothers and sisters joined us in the bread-breaking meeting. This stirred up a great deal of jealousy. When the war started, the Japanese began to persecute me. A dozen or more people in Christianity also began to join hands to attack me. The Japanese put me into prison for a month. After I was released from prison, I was not free from their hands. I was not the only one who was restricted; many other brothers and sisters also lost their freedom. At that time the Lord prepared a way for me: I became ill and incurred tuberculosis of the lungs, and I had to rest for a year. During this period I experienced many trials, and I was pressed on all sides. It was not until 1944 that I began to stand up to do a little speaking to the saints. I have spent half of my life in Chefoo. In October 1944 the Lord arranged for me to leave Chefoo to go to Tsingtao. At that time I told the brothers and sisters that I had to go to take a rest. In this way I left Chefoo, and I have never gone back.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 12, 1948, 6:30 a.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE RECOVERY&mdash;<br />MARTIN LUTHER</h2><p>God's work of recovery began with Martin Luther. From that time God began to have distinct recoveries on the earth. This, of course, does not mean that the recovery began with Luther alone. At the same time that he was raised up, other people saw the same things that he did. He is merely taken as a representative of the recovery in that age. Before his time the truth had become a kind of tradition, the apostolic ministry had become a system of popery, the oneness of the church had become an ecclesiastical ecumenism, and spiritual authority had become political authority. The church was taken captive to Babylon. The prevailing thought at that time was that the church ruled over the world; it declared that the whole world belonged to God. As a result, the Catholic Church brought unconverted people into the church. As long as a person was a Roman citizen, he was automatically a member of the church. Spontaneously, infant baptism came in. Originally, Christians were people who took the voluntary way of poverty. Christians and poor people were always linked together. But when the church opened its door to the world, voluntary poverty was lost, and the church became rich. Under normal circumstances, there should be two kinds of poor people in the church. One kind is those who are naturally poor, and the other kind is those who are voluntarily poor. Today in the church, we have the first kind of poor people. But there is not the second kind of poor people. On the contrary, there are rich people in the church, and the church is filled with affluence. Although many people are rich in material goods, they are poor in faith, and the inward spiritual content among them becomes more and more depleted.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF VOLUNTARY POVERTY</h2><p>From the time of Clement, the truth became less and less clear. On the one hand, men became more and more capable of analysis and exposition, but at the same time, they lacked life and did not have much grace or righteousness. Even at the time of Augustine, the truth was still unclear. Historically speaking, the church was always on the decline. Eventually, it fell to such a low degree that reactions rose up within the Catholic Church. One of those who reacted was Francis of Assisi. He was dissatisfied with the outward riches of the church. He was originally a rich man, or at least the son of a rich man. Within a few days, he sold everything and gave it to the poor. He began to practice a life of voluntary poverty. However, the things he wrote are unreadable. We may tolerate a line or two of his writings, but by the third line, they are intolerable. Although we cannot tolerate his writings, the practice of voluntary poverty is nevertheless right.</p><p>In the church those who receive little should not be in want, and those who receive much should not have an excess (2 Cor. 8:12-15). It is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to receive much and to have excess. If a man knows the Lord, he will invest everything in the Lord. If a man says that he loves the Lord, yet will not invest in the Lord, his love is false. The Lord said that we will always have the poor with us (John 12:8). He did not say that we will always have poor brothers with us in the church. Rather, He said that the poor we always have with us. Among the brothers and sisters, it is not difficult to be without want. As long as those who have excess will give it away, poor brothers will not appear among us. The Lord's principle is not to keep, but to give. If we all give, there will not be unnecessary riches in the church. It is abnormal that some people are too rich in the church. All excess riches have to be given away. In the world people throw away their lives in exchange for money, but in the Bible, God wants our lives instead of money. We cannot be a Christian in an uncertain way. Our God is not uncertain; He is very specific. He wants not only our money, but our lives as well.</p><p>Later, God raised up Count Zinzendorf of Saxony in Moravia. Originally, he was an aristocrat and a man of learning. For the Lord's sake he set aside his estate to receive all kinds of believers. Through his work, the Moravians were raised up. Many people were sent to foreign lands from this group. The number of those sent out from them exceeds the number sent from any other group and ranks highest in terms of percentage. Then there was Sister Eva, a German. She also took the way of voluntary poverty.</p><p>In the last century the Brethren were raised up. They were very strong in the truth. Although they did not like to talk very much about themselves, several dozen of their leaders also sold their possessions at one time to follow the Lord. For a Christian, the question of money must be settled once for all. If it is not settled, the Lord cannot have a way to go on. What is the meaning of degradation in the church? It means that the principle of economy has come into the church. Once the principle of economy comes in, everything will be reckoned according to value, and the Lord will have no way to go on.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEFICIENCY OF THE REFORMATION</h2><h2 class="head2">The Recovery of Faith<br />without a Clear Understanding of Justification</h2><p>In Luther we see the recovery of faith. However, Luther did not recover justification by faith. He only recovered faith; he was not so clear concerning justification. History tells us that he once punished himself in order to be justified. In Rome he once climbed up to a cathedral step by step in order to be justified. Later, he saw that a man is not justified by works, but by faith.</p><h2 class="head2">Bringing In National Churches</h2><p>Luther came out of Babylon, but he did not return to Jerusalem. He brought politics into the church and thought that this would help the church. Little did he realize that no political power can help the church. On the contrary, any political power will only damage the church. In the end the national churches were formed. The national churches are partnerships between politicians and believers. One contributed Germany, the other contributed doctrines, and the result was the national church. In Germany the Lutheran Church became the national church. The Lutherans embraced the power of politics because Roman Catholicism was too strong. But by so doing, there was a change of nationality instead of a change of the church. The church was changed from a Roman church to a German church. In England it became the Anglican Church. Every Englishman automatically became a member of the Anglican Church. As soon as a person was born, he was baptized in the church. No question was asked as to whether such a person was regenerated. The only thing that mattered was whether such a person was an Englishman. As long as a person was an Englishman and was born in England, he was a member of the church. Consequently, the tradition of infant baptism by sprinkling became very prevailing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RAISING UP OF INDEPENDENT CHURCHES</h2><p>With the rising up of the national churches, many pure seekers and lovers of the Lord became dissatisfied. They did not want to remain in the national churches. As a result some independent free churches were formed. Soon after the Reformation, there were over two thousand independent churches. In Switzerland alone there were over two hundred such churches. During this period of time the Roman Catholic Church persecuted the Protestant churches, and the Protestant churches in turn persecuted the smaller independent churches. To stop these small churches from being established, the English Parliament even passed a law to unify all the churches in England. However, this produced the so-called Nonconformists. They were faithful lovers of the Lord raised up by Him, who would not cooperate with the national churches. The government persecuted them and ordered them to take jobs five miles away from their former places of occupation. They could not work for the government, and all of them who were government officers were removed from their posts. Those who opposed the law were condemned.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE EQUALITY OF BELIEVERS<br />AND THE TRUTH OF BAPTISM</h2><p>After this, there were the Mennonites, who were the first group of believers to realize the error of a hierarchy. Among them, they recovered the title of "brothers,'' and they addressed each other as brothers. Some of them went to Russia to preach the gospel. In addition, the Baptists were also raised up. They saw the error of infant baptism and taught that a man must first be clear about the truth of baptism before he can be baptized. They were called the Anabaptists, and they were much persecuted at the beginning. These are recoveries of the outward things.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE INNER LIFE</h2><p>In addition, there was the recovery of the inner life. Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and others brought in a recovery of the spiritual condition. These ones are now generally called the mystics. They practiced denying their self, joining themselves with God to oppose their self, giving no excuse to the self, and not asking God to spare His hand on them. In every age we can find followers of their practice. In addition to these, there were also the Pietists and the Quietists.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RAISING UP OF THE PURITANS</h2><p>Later, the Puritans were raised up. Among them, some from Holland and England migrated separately to America. The Mayflower was one of the ships that carried these Puritan immigrants to the new land.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE BRETHREN</h2><h2 class="head2">The Heavenly Calling of the Church</h2><p>In the last century God began to have a special recovery. First, He recovered the heavenly calling of the church. The church is like the Israelites in the Old Testament. It should not look to earthly blessings at any time. The church is a group of people who have been called by heaven. It is not their aim to reform society. God's people are those who take the heavenly way on earth. They have given up all hope for the world and society. To them, the world is passing away, and everything therein will be judged. The church's view is different from that of the world. What the church expects is heaven, not world reforms. These words are familiar to us today, and we may not feel the power behind these words. But at the beginning, this matter was a tremendous recovery.</p><h2 class="head2">The Oneness of the Church</h2><p>Second, the Brethren recovered the oneness of the church. They saw the oneness of the Body of Christ and realized that the church is in a state of ruin today. Expositors such as J. N. Darby and F. W. Grant all agreed that the church is in a state of ruin today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RAISING UP OF JOHN WESLEY&mdash;<br />THE RECOVERY OF SANCTIFICATION BY FAITH</h2><p>These recoveries occurred among the Brethren. In addition to them, John Wesley was raised up. He recovered the truth concerning sanctification. A man is not only justified by faith, but is also sanctified by faith. Wesley was indeed a servant of God, a dear brother, and a man greatly used by God. He bore the right testimony, but quoted the wrong verses to prove his message. Although his quotations were wrong, the doctrine he preached was right. For example, he quoted 1 John 1:7 as a reference to sanctification. For this reason, some rejected his teachings altogether. This is to go too far. It is possible for a man to quote the wrong verses. However, if he is the right person and he preaches the right doctrine, the mistake is not fatal even if his quotations are wrong. However, if the quotations are correct but the person is wrong, the problem is much more serious. We would rather see the person right and the quotations wrong than see the quotations right and the person wrong. Although he quoted the wrong verses, God was still able to cause men to be sanctified.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF SANCTIFICATION BY CONSECRATION</h2><p>Then there was Robert Pearsall Smith, a porcelain merchant. He was the husband of Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith, the writer of the book The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. At that time men were not very clear concerning the doctrine of sanctification. He preached that man is not just sanctified by faith, but by consecration as well. Sanctification does not come merely by faith, but by consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KESWICK CONVENTION AND OTHERS</h2><p>In addition to Robert Pearsall Smith, there were others like Evan Hopkins of England and Theodore Monod of France. These ones, together with Smith in America, formed the so-called Keswick movement. In addition there was Andrew Murray, a Dutchman. The raising up of these brothers set the general scene for the recovery. However, their recoveries were not complete. There were still recoveries of other minor points. For example, we have the recovery of the hymns by Frances Ridley Havergal, and some other contributions by other writers.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE OLD MAN</h2><p>During the last century, God enlightened men concerning the matter of consecration and its importance through the brothers we have mentioned. However, their revelations were not deep enough. Consecration is not simply a kind of exchange, in which we offer to God all that we have and all that we are, and we take back from Him what He has and what He is. Darby told others that consecration is based on the casting off of the man of flesh and the removal of this man. The goal of the gospel is not only to forgive the sinner's sin, but to crucify the sinner. The gospel saves not merely by forgiving the sinner and delivering him from perdition, but by crucifying the sinner with the Lord. In preaching the gospel, we have to be careful. If we are not careful, we will easily preach the wrong thing. The gospel removes not only the sin in the flesh, but the person of the flesh. What goes to the heavens is the new man, not the fleshly man. All spiritual lessons, including obedience and our service to the Lord, must be practiced in accordance with this principle. Even lessons as spiritual as those taught by Madame Guyon must be pursued according to the principle spoken of by Darby.</p><p>Romans 7 says that we are dead to the law. This is why we can be married to Christ. Not only are our sins dead, but we ourselves are dead. If we were not dead, it would be unlawful and adulterous for us to be joined to Christ. If we are dead, we are not our own person any longer, because the cross has removed our own person. Today there is no longer any need for this person to ask for forgiveness. Only a living person needs forgiveness; a dead person does not need forgiveness. The one who was dead in sin is the crucified old man, and the cross has removed this old man already. This was what Darby preached.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF THE CROSS</h2><p>After this, we have Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who was raised up to preach the truth concerning the cross. She preached about the cross dealing with the old man. Her understanding was more advanced. Notwithstanding, our understanding of the subject is more clear than that of Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF RESURRECTION</h2><p>After Mrs. Penn-Lewis, T. Austin-Sparks saw resurrection. We have been talking about resurrection for years, but we do not know what resurrection really is. Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote two books about resurrection, but she was not very clear about the subject either. It was not until Brother T. Austin-Sparks wrote about resurrection in 1926 and published what he wrote in The Overcomer magazine that the world knew for the first time what resurrection is. When Miss Barber and I read his writings, we began to pay attention to this matter. Many people talk about resurrection, but they have not presented resurrection to others&mdash;the real thing itself. When Brother Austin-Sparks talked about resurrection, light came. He presented the very resurrection itself to others.</p><p>What is resurrection? It is life going into death and passing through death. In the process, what succumbs to death dies, and what cannot die comes out of death alive. This coming out of death is resurrection. Resurrection is anything that death cannot swallow up.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM</h2><h2 class="head2">The Welsh Revival</h2><p>Let us go on to one more subject, the kingdom. The kingdom is a common subject, but to merely discuss the term kingdom is useless. The question is whether or not the kingdom as the very thing itself has been realized. When did men begin to see the kingdom? I can say that it was during the Welsh Revival that the kingdom as a real thing was recovered. Between 1901 and 1910 Evan Roberts brought in the Great Welsh Revival. This revival was unprecedented in church history. No other revival could match this one. Its effects cut far and deep. Roberts himself was a coal miner, and he did not receive much education. Yet God greatly used him. At that time he was only in his twenties, a very young man, and he was not eloquent at all in preaching. Yet his spirit was strong. His prayers were so powerful that it was said that God had to answer those prayers. He learned from Mrs. Penn-Lewis and also from J. C. Williams. He did not have much schooling. However, when others came in contact with him, they were saved and brought to their knees. He was not eloquent. During the Welsh Revival, he did not preach many messages. When he did stand up, his speaking lasted only fifteen minutes. Yet even those who dropped by to listen were known to be saved through his words.</p><p>Some have said that the Welsh Revival was affected by China, because the revival took place between 1901 and 1910, whereas in 1900 there was the Boxer Rebellion in China. During that rebellion, many Christians were martyred. After the rebellion, between 1901 and 1902, many Christians throughout the world began to pray for God's work. The answer to all those prayers was funneled into one man. Roberts himself was confined to his bed because of illness between 1903 and 1904, and he was not released until 1909. When he finally got up, he began to speak to everyone he met concerning the things he saw. In The Overcomer magazine, it was mentioned that during the meetings others would often ask what he was going to say, and he would also wonder what he was going to say. Yet once his mouth was opened, something came out, and men saw the light.</p><h2 class="head2">The Kingdom Being to Gain Ground for God</h2><p>During the past few years, I have seen a little of what God's kingdom is. God's kingdom is a great matter. Now when I pray, I pray for God's kingdom. God desires that His kingdom come on earth. In order for God's kingdom to come on earth, there is the need for the church's prayer.</p><p>What is the kingdom? The kingdom is man gaining ground for God on earth. Where God's kingdom is, there God gains the ground. Today man thinks that the kingdom is a question of history. Actually, the kingdom is a question of geography.</p><h2 class="head2">The Kingdom Being<br />a Matter of Spiritual Warfare</h2><p>In order to have the kingdom and in order for God to gain the ground, there is the need for warfare. Hence, in order to recover the kingdom, we have to recover spiritual warfare. The truths on spiritual warfare were recovered by Mrs. Penn-Lewis. In her illness she experienced spiritual warfare, and she saw that many people were deceived through their ignorance of spiritual warfare. Later, in collaboration with Evan Roberts, she wrote the book War on the Saints and released the truth concerning spiritual warfare. This light was hidden from man for two thousand years. Through Mrs. Penn-Lewis, it was recovered. Actually, this light is recorded in Ephesians 6, but no one before her had the experience of it.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE REALITY<br />OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">Messages concerning the Body of Christ</h2><p>About 1930 Brother T. Austin-Sparks went on further to see the Body. From that time on, he continued to speak on the Body. He released over five or six hundred pages of messages on this subject. Yet what he released were only teachings; the reality had not yet appeared.</p><h2 class="head2">The Body Life</h2><p>The Lord's church is one Body because it has only one life. This Body comes out of one life. This life is the life of the Lord, which is the life of the Son of God. Since the Body comes out of one life, there is the need for coordination. We are not merely individuals, but we are parts of a whole. We are like the parts of a car; only when we come together can there be the whole car. We all come from one life. We need to realize today that the life we received is a Body life. What we have received individually is a "partial'' life. Hence, we do not receive personal edification and then become coordinated. Rather, in and by coordination we grow up to receive everything. If we see this fact, all those who will be saved after us will immediately see the reality of this fact and enter into it. As soon as they are saved, they will become persons who voluntarily hand themselves over to the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">The Proper Body Life Not Yet Realized</h2><p>The gospel is not prevailing today because the proper church is not yet manifested. In a proper church, as soon as a person is saved, he hands himself over to the church and sees the Body. Today men do not have a proper consecration after they are saved. As a result, we have to go back and help them to make up their consecration. There is no proper church today. Hence, there is no place where we can show a saved person the normal condition of the church. The hindrance today is with us; we have not provided others with the necessary make-up lessons. If enough brothers and sisters would take the ground of God's absolute salvation, consecrate themselves fully to the Lord after they are saved, and hand themselves over fully, the church would find the power and the authority to testify for the Lord and would bring others to the proper stand from the first day on.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RECOVERY TODAY<br />BEING ON OUR SHOULDERS</h2><p>Today the responsibility of the recovery is on our shoulders. All the questions related to the recovery have to do with us. God's work in the world, and in China in particular, depends entirely on us. The responsibility has fallen on us. We have to see that in the Body there is only one life. If we see this, we will see the need for coordination. The problem that exists among the brothers and sisters reflects the problem that exists with us. If we are not the right kind of persons, we will not be able to preach the right kind of gospel. The gospel not only delivers men from sin, the world, and the self; it also delivers men from individualism, from money, and from everything else into the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">The Last Recovery&mdash;<br />the Coordination in the Body<br />and the Manifestation of Authority</h2><p>With each step that the Lord has taken in His recovery, the content of His recovery has become richer and richer. Today it seems as if there is nothing more to be recovered. The recovery has reached the stage of the Body. Perhaps this will be the last recovery. There may be other items of recovery, but as far as we know, when we reach the recovery of the coordination of the Body and the manifestation of authority, we have reached the final recovery.</p><h2 class="head2">Taking the Way of Submission</h2><p>In order to arrive at this recovery, God requires that there be the manifestation of authority among us. We have to take the way of submission. If we submit, God will take the way of increase among us. The need today is that such a recovery first be realized in us individually. We have to be an all-inclusive person, and we should have all-inclusive experiences. The gospel we preach should be an all-inclusive gospel. When a man receives this gospel, not only are his sins forgiven, but he is brought into the Body. If we do this, in a few years' time the condition of the church will be entirely different. Today the responsibility rests entirely on us.</p><h2 class="head2">Having the Body Consciousness</h2><p>What we need today is a Body consciousness. The reality of the Body life lies in the Body consciousness. This is something that cannot be copied or imitated. In Kuling one brother asked what his future holds. Once this brother asked this question, his future was finished. In the Body we do not have an individual future; we only have the future of the Body. We would rather be wrong in the Body than be wrong in ourselves. I would rather submit to the Body than seek for my personal future and offend the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Judgment of the Body Being More Reliable</h2><p>Brother David Hsu: How do I know that I will not lead others into mistakes?</p><p>Brother Nee: Actually, we are not aware of all the mistakes we make in our own lives. Who is responsible for these mistakes? Of course, we are responsible for them ourselves. Since we make mistakes in any case, I would rather make them in the Body. It is better to make mistakes in the Body than to make them in ourselves. If three, five, thirty, or fifty people know the will of God in the church today, and I do not have the right judgment concerning certain matters or persons, is it not better that I take their judgment than make a judgment myself? In the Body we sometimes become more clear when we do not know something, and we become unclear when we know too much. When a judgment is made by the Body, the responsibility rests on the Body. Sometimes when things happen to us and we are directly involved with them, we become affected by the factors involved and fail to have a clear discernment concerning the matters. But the Body is not affected by personal factors. It is not as easily influenced, and as such, its judgment is more reliable.</p><p>If we do not have any spiritual reality with us, these words may sound like Catholic teachings. If we do not have any spiritual reality, Catholicism will indeed come in. But if spiritual reality is with us, we will realize that no matter how good our personal judgments may be, they can never be compared to the judgments of those with spiritual discernment in the Body. We cannot fight against the Body consciousness. Whenever we feel uncomfortable or uneasy, we have to give up and submit ourselves to the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Submit to Authority</h2><p>Today we have to learn to submit to God's authority. Everywhere we see man's rebellion. In any kind of human institution, we see rebellion and insubordination. Man wants to be free and independent. He has his own proposals, views, and judgments. But there are no such things in the kingdom of God. In God's kingdom there is only order and submission. There is nothing better in the whole world than submission, and there is nothing more beautiful in the whole world than order. Here we have submission, and we submit one to another. Here we have no arguments, and no one strives to be the greatest. There is only divine order. What a beautiful thing it is when everyone is pursuing after submission!</p><p>Allow me to give a little testimony of my own. I began to learn this lesson in 1922. At that time, I was learning in tears. Although the person to whom I had to submit was not necessarily right and although I may have been right instead, I would not have received the discipline of the Body if I had refused to submit. Perhaps at that time, there was not the discipline of the Body yet. But at least, there was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. When I first began to work for the Lord, I was quite young. Another co-worker was five years older than me. At the beginning he was quite zealous, but he did not have much light. However, God gave me a great deal of light. At that time many people exhorted men to believe in Jesus without being able to explain what they said. But I saw more light than others did with regard to the truth of the gospel. At one point over sixty people wanted to be baptized, of whom ninety percent had been saved through me. Since I had brought them to salvation, naturally I should have been the one to baptize them. But the other brother insisted that he baptize them because he was older. The Bible clearly indicates that whoever preaches the gospel also baptizes the ones he preaches to (Acts 8:35-38). I thought that it was quite reasonable for me to baptize them. Later, I went to Miss Barber, but she said that I should let the other brother baptize them. I asked her why, and she told me that the other brother was older than me. Later, I found another brother who was older than the first, and I suggested that the second brother should carry out the baptisms. But Miss Barber insisted that the first one carry out the baptisms. I was quite bothered. She told me that I should not reason, and she said, "Listen! From now on you have to learn to listen to your brother.'' I wondered why I should listen to a brother who was not clear about the truth or the way of God. This went on for three years. Every Sunday I fasted. God was teaching me the lesson of submission. Today I can work together with others because I have learned this lesson.</p><p>The Bible contains the centurion's word: "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me'' (Matt. 8:9). This is submission. Brother Witness Lee once said to me, "You are very severe when you speak on the platform, but your speaking is not so severe when you step off the platform.'' Whether I am severe or not, I do feel that a person who will not submit to authority is a wild and disorderly person. Those who live in the church should submit to authority. A person who does not submit to authority may be saved, but he does not act like a regenerated person. Whenever a person is free from any authority, he has no way to go on, and he does not have the reality of the church with him.</p><p>With God there is the anointing, and this anointing is poured upon the church. On the one hand, we have to submit to the anointing within us. On the other hand, we have to submit to the anointing in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Protection and Blessings in the Body</h2><p>A Christian is very safe today because there is the protection of the Body for him. A man can be miles off the target if a boundary is not defined for him. Today many truths have been established, and there is no reason for us to stray off any longer. As long as we remain in the Body, the blessings and the anointing are here.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING AN ABSOLUTE PERSON</h2><p>We have to see that the whole problem rests with us today. We have to realize how great our responsibility is. Because of our unfaithfulness, we dare not preach the complete gospel to the sinners. We must be transformed before we can preach a transforming gospel. We must be different before we can preach a different gospel. There must be a recovered person before there can be a recovered gospel. There must be men who are coordinated before there can be the gospel that brings in coordination. If we are not a certain type of person, we can never preach that certain type of gospel. We must be men of Acts 2 before we can preach the gospel of Acts 2. Only then will we produce more men of Acts 2. If your family, career, money, or position is your center, I have nothing to say. But I can tell you that you cannot be a co-worker. Unless we ourselves are the right kind of person, we can never expect others to be the right kind of persons. If we are not absolute, in twenty or thirty years God will raise up men who will be absolute. Whether or not God will find a way in this generation depends on whether there are absolute people in this generation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE IMPACT OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In the early churches, although the number of saved ones was not too great, there were men who were on fire. Although many of them did not preach much, what they said at the time of their martyrdom spoke louder than what we preach for a whole lifetime. What is needed today is nothing less than absolute obedience and absolute consecration. These are the things that will bring in the power. In his book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon described the sufferings of the martyrs. They were persecuted, exiled, and often abused by the Roman soldiers. Yet the more the persecution came, the more people were saved. The question today is how much has the gospel laid hold of us. The more the gospel lays hold of us, the greater the impact of the gospel will be.</p><p>Whether or not we can cause the next generation to be a people of Acts 2 depends on how well we perform today. The question is whether or not we are willing to be torn down. The recovery may come to a halt when it comes to us, or it may have a new breakthrough from us. If God gains His way through us, those who are saved after us will not be like the saved ones we see today; a better breed will emerge. What others say and criticize is not important to us. The important thing is the kind of persons we are before God.</p><p>Our God is a God who is always going on. The Father works until now, and the Son also works (John 5:17). If we offer up all our time, money, and everything, power will come. At the beginning the Lord demanded that the believers sacrifice their lives to follow Him. The calling today is more serious than it was then. Formerly, we may have exhorted others to believe in the Lord by giving them a pat on the back and saying nice words to them. But today asking others to believe in the Lord is the same as asking for their lives. Formerly, we begged others to believe, as if they were granting us a favor by believing in the Lord. Today the situation has turned. A man must realize that believing in the Lord will cost him his very life. I am afraid that there are not many places on earth where the kind of message we have today is preached.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO GO ON</h2><p>In order to match God's work, the way before us needs some adjustments. I can mention a few of these. First, there is the need to train people. In training people, we need to pay attention to the vessels themselves. The vessels must be right before the work can be right. Second, we have to strengthen our existing works. Third, we have to learn to judge others and to deal with others. We have to stop those who are too much and strengthen those who are not enough. In the future we will judge the world and the angels (1 Cor. 6:2-3). For this reason, we have to learn to judge today. The first one we have to learn to judge is ourselves. If we do not judge ourselves, our judgment will not be clear. If we ourselves have been dealt with, our judgments will be accurate. Those who are the ministers of the word should especially learn the proper lessons. At the same time, all the brothers and sisters should learn to receive the portion of the ministers of the word.</p><p>Fourth, money must have no place in the heart of the co-workers. The co-workers must be delivered from the bondage of money. Any feeling for money in the co-workers must be completely taken away. We hope that the Lord will work to such an extent that we can have all things in common in the church.</p><p>Fifth, the local churches should pay much attention to the newly saved ones, to properly equip them and to render them the clear teachings. Two kinds of perfectings are necessary. One is the preaching of the gospel. This must be done year round in all the places. The other is the edification of the new believers. This needs a few dozen topics with which we educate the new believers week after week. These topics are fixed topics; there is no need to devise more advanced topics. The same topics can be used year round. Those who will serve as the speaking vessels need to learn these topics first. They should also know how to use the adequate materials.</p><p>Some brothers should remain in a place to wait on the Lord. Some should spend more time traveling to other places, while the rest stay in one place. Everyone should learn to work together as a Body. There should not be a church that is tied to its own "turf,'' one that is closed to outsiders.</p><h2 class="head1">AS CONSECRATED ONES, LIVING FULLY FOR GOD</h2><p>There are certain things concerning consecration that are difficult to speak about. According to the Bible, there is no such thing as an unconsecrated saved one. Everyone who is saved is consecrated to the Lord. All the brothers and sisters who have consecrated themselves should move and act together with the co-workers.</p><p>The Bible says that the poor we have always with us. It is wrong for us to pile up goods in our houses. The basic principle and requirement of the Scriptures is that we should help the poor. Whether or not a poor person is among us, the Bible requires that we give to him. If we have never remembered the poor, our hearts will not be enlarged. When we give things away, we will learn to have an enlarged heart, and we will develop an enlarged view. Today it is difficult to find people with large hearts and broad views. The Bible teaches us not to be bound by material riches. Every commandment in the Bible is for us to keep. If we fail to keep any one of them, we will suffer loss. It is easy to give to our own brothers, but it is not easy to give to outsiders. Nevertheless, the requirement of the Scriptures is that we remember the poor.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters do not realize how the co-workers live. Some co-workers have no fire on their stove for five days in a row. Others do not have money to provide education for their children or adequate support for their family's livelihood.</p><p>We should help the brothers and sisters to choose their jobs in a proper way. In this kind of coordination, it is right for some to devote themselves to making money. But the only ones who are qualified to make money are those who are fully consecrated. Only this kind of moneymaking will be of any use. When the Israelites left Egypt, they took all the money with them (Exo. 12:36). When they crossed the Red Sea, the money crossed over with them. Any money that was left in Egypt, regardless of how much, was useless. Only those who have passed through the Red Sea can employ their money to the proper use for the building up of the tabernacle. First, the person himself needs to be delivered. Second, the money has to follow. Third, there is the building up of the tabernacle. Formerly, we did not have the boldness to say this. But now we do. A person must first consecrate himself. If he does not do this, God does not want his money. The sin of the golden calf must first be exposed, and a person must be delivered from such sin before the question of the gold can be settled. The gold went to the calf because man first worshipped idols. The gold should have been given to the tabernacle. But because of idolatry, the gold went to the calf. Hence, the worship of the golden calf was not only a matter of sin, but a loss for the tabernacle. It was the same gold. When it was placed on the golden calf, it was wrong and had to be ground into powder. But when it was placed in the tabernacle, it was right. The same material could be directed toward different objects. One object was an idol. The other object was the tabernacle. In the New Testament covetousness is placed side by side with idolatry. Idolatry is linked to covetousness (Col. 3:5). Where there is deliverance from idolatry, there is deliverance from money.</p><p>Today all the co-workers should go on despite all kinds of suffering. However, the rest of the brothers and sisters should also learn to be consecrated. This does not mean that everyone has to be a preacher; it means that everyone has to be a consecrated person. What is needed today are fully consecrated people. Not everyone is a preacher, but everyone should be for God full-time.</p><p>As long as there is a group of people who will go on in this way, we will see the emergence of Acts 2 Christians wherever they are. If we are consecrated, God will have a way to go on. If we do not consecrate ourselves, God's word will be jeopardized and depreciated. Acts 2 Christians are those who are at a crossroad. They see exactly the way ahead, and they have the boldness to tell others the right way to go. The more we fear that others will not believe, the more we will beg them to believe. If we have enough deposit within and are clear about the way ahead of us, we will have the assurance to speak. Then others will have the confidence to believe us. Others cannot have faith in us because we do not have faith in the first place. However, if we are clear, others will follow us. If we are not clear, we will surely depreciate and discredit God's word. The issue today is fully with us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 12, 1948, Monday, 6:30 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE BODY LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit Being<br />the Starting Point of the Work</h2><p>Brother Chu-en: Will the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch become another form of a "central'' church or "head'' church?</p><p>Brother Nee: Our work today does not begin from Antioch. Nor does it begin from Jerusalem. Our work today begins from the Holy Spirit. The basic question is the starting point of our work.</p><h2 class="head2">The Work Being Carried Out in the Body</h2><p>We have to realize that the church is a Body. As such, our work cannot be carried out individually; it must be carried out in a corporate way. Neither can we be a Christian individually. Perhaps a person is a well-behaved Christian. However, he must be put together with others before his real condition is made manifest. Only those who know the Body will deal with themselves and coordinate with others. A man may have the greatest achievements and may appear to be very spiritual, but this should not be mistaken as true progress and true spirituality. Only by working with others will we realize whether there is true progress and whether the self is truly dealt with. When the self assumes the throne, it sees no one but itself. But if the self is dealt with, we will see others and will not see ourselves.</p><h2 class="head2">The Body Being the Test of Spirituality</h2><p>We must always bear in mind that our life is a part of the whole. We must live together with the whole. There are severe disciplines in the Body. The way of the Body is the cross. Those who have not seen the cross do not see the Body. When relatives live far away from one another, they maintain good harmony. But when they move close together, they become enemies. When a person lives in a house by himself, there is comfort and bliss. But when two brothers live together, they have to learn to take the cross. The more people live together and the closer they are to one another, the more crosses there are. Sometimes a person is put in a situation where he has crosses all over him. What man considers as spiritual progress does not count unless it can pass the test of the Body. The only thing that will count is that which can pass the test of the Body. No matter how great a person's works are, how many gifts he has, and how much life he possesses, if he is not in the Body, none of these matters count. Only when a person puts himself among the co-workers and the brothers and sisters will he know how much he has been delivered from the self and how much he knows about the cross.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Limitations<br />and the Coordination in the Body</h2><p>The first thing we have to know is the Body of Christ. Once a person sees the Body of Christ, he will see coordination spontaneously. In the Body the Lord has His assigned authorities. Who is an authority? Whoever has the ministry has the authority. Ministry is authority. We have to accept our own limitations. We must realize that we are only one minister before the Lord and that we have to work together with other ministers before we can meet the need. We should seek coordination. When one member cannot meet the need, he needs the coordination of the other members. Only by coordination can we receive the supply from the Body everywhere we go. A man needs the coordination of the other members. At the same time, he needs to accept the limitations of the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission to Authority<br />Being Submission to the Head</h2><p>Authority is the deputy of the Head. When the eyes see, it is actually not the eyes that are seeing but the head that sees. When the limbs move, they are not the ones that are moving, but the head that is moving. All the movements of the body are headed up by the head. What is ministry? Ministry is the movement of the Head. Whenever we are at odds with the ministry, we are at odds with the Head. In the Bible the overwhelming majority of authorities are deputy authorities. When we speak about submission to authority, we mean submission to deputy authorities. The real manifestation of authority is the expression of the Head. Submitting to authority is submitting to the Head. For this reason, God's children should learn submission.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Ministry<br />Rather Than Repeating the Ministry</h2><p>Ministry is expressed in two things: gift and authority. The gift is the power of the ministry. It is also the expression of authority. A man cannot accept the gift while rejecting the authority. For example, on the one hand, the eyes have the gift of seeing. On the other hand, they have the authority, and other members have to accept them. If other members do not accept the eyes, they will not receive the supply of their gift. As long as you are a member of the Body, you have to accept the gifts of the other members. There is no need for you to repeat their gifts. Concerning the ministry, there is only the question of accepting; there is no need of repeating. What we have to do today is not a matter of repeating others' ministries, like duplicating with carbon paper. All we have to do is to accept.</p><p>We should always remember that we are only a member; we are not the whole Body. No one is all-inclusive. If a person is all-inclusive, he is no longer a member. The parts of a car are only the parts; they are not the whole. The parts cannot equal the whole car.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Member Enjoying<br />the Riches of the Body</h2><p>Although I am only a member, I can share the riches of the Body. Every member in the Body shares the riches of the Body. My fingers never complain that they cannot see. My ears never complain that they cannot walk. They never say, "Why can we not walk like the feet?'' The many gifts in the Body are there to perfect the saints. This is why there is no division in the Body, and there are no conflicting ideologies. Although the position of the hand dictates that it cannot be the speaking member, the hand is satisfied as long as the mouth can speak. The mouth speaking is the same as the hand speaking. The life that we received is a partial life; it is not the whole life. When we experience the riches of the other members in this way, the Body is perfected. Under these circumstances, how can the individual members be poor, and how can they be useless?</p><h2 class="head2">Coordination Dealing with the Self</h2><p>Many people think that what they have is theirs, and that what others have is not theirs. However, we have to realize that individualism is the worst thing in the Body. In the Body of Christ individualism must be removed. The greatest test to the self is in the meetings, in the church, and among the brothers and sisters. On the one hand, we have to see that we are members individually. On the other hand, we have to see that we are a Body together with many other members. It is easy to deal with unbelievers. As soon as they walk through the door, they realize that they have the wrong address and have stumbled into the wrong place. But it is not so easy to deal with individualism. Individualism often creeps into the church without one realizing it. It is when a person is being coordinated together that his self is most severely dealt with. The minute a man lives in coordination, his self is dealt with.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE REALITY OF THE BODY LIFE</h2><p>We must see the Body life before we can consider the question of the church in Antioch. First, there is the Body life. Then we have the church in Antioch. For this reason we must have some make-up lessons, before we discuss the question of Antioch. If the reality of the Holy Spirit is present in the church, the question of central control no longer exists. However, if there is only approval by vote, planning, and resolutions in our work, instead of the reality of the Holy Spirit, we have nothing more than central organization; it will be Roman Catholicism.</p><p>Catholics say that there is only one church, that their priests are the only kind of people who can understand the Bible, and that their church is the only true church. It is true that there is only one church. But the way Roman Catholics interpret this oneness is not the right way. How can something right be wrong in the hands of the Catholics? We have to realize that it is right for the church to be one, but in the Catholic Church, there are human ideas, methods, and organizations. As a result, that which is right becomes wrong. Luther gave us two things: justification by faith and an open Bible. It is true that the Lord's recovery has made it possible for everyone to read the Bible, but this does not mean that everyone is able to interpret the Bible. Some do not have the gift of interpretation, yet they insist on interpreting the Bible. The result is errors. Some think that by putting together a few verses they can come up with a new doctrine. This not only produces wrong teachings; it also takes men out of the sphere of God's grace. Some cannot be subdued even when others point out the error in their teachings; they still insist on speaking. These people can never be taught.</p><p>God has set up teachers in the church (1 Cor. 12:28). The teachers interpret the Bible. In the church some have been set up to interpret the Bible. The meeting spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14 has the prophets as its center. Not everyone can interpret the Scriptures. In the meeting, when those who can interpret the Scriptures stand up to speak, the others should discern. However, this does not mean that the interpretation of one or two, or of a few, will ascertain a truth. The speaking is done by one or two, but the others have to discern. Even when the congregation is not able to discern, the words of the prophets must still be judged by the Spirit of the Lord.</p><p>Antioch was not a center, because it was not the product of an organization but the product of the Holy Spirit. Once the church is separate from the Holy Spirit and once it has lost its spiritual reality, it becomes the Roman Catholic Church. It is possible for Catholicism to be found among us. The basic question today is not the method of Antioch, but the kind of person we are. Are we a person living in the spiritual reality? This is the basic issue. Whether or not a local church can become a central church depends basically on whether or not that church is spiritual. This is the foremost issue.</p><h2 class="head1">NO LOCAL CHURCH BECOMING A HEAD CHURCH</h2><p>Factually speaking, the church in Antioch could not have become a head church either. In fact, Antioch never exercised supervision over other churches. One local church cannot exercise supervision over another church. However, the work has the right to exercise supervision over a local church. The church in Antioch never exercised supervision over another church, but the apostles who went out from Antioch did exercise supervision over other churches. When a problem arises in a local church, the matter has to be brought to the attention of the workers. First Timothy 5:19 indicates that an accusation against an elder must be accompanied by the word of two or three witnesses. An accusation could not be based on rumors or hearsay; there had to be witnesses, and the accusations had to be presented to Timothy. Timothy was a worker. Therefore, he could deal with the problem of the elders in a locality. Antioch was only one local church. Jerusalem was also another local church. As far as being a church is concerned, the question of a head church does not exist. But as far as the work is concerned, it is something different.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STARTING POINT OF THE WORK BEING<br />THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</h2><p>The starting point of the work in Antioch was the sending forth of two or three men. However, if workers are sent out by the work, the question of organization may come in. During our gathering this time, brothers from different localities have come on their own accord. Such a kind of gathering is not a product of organization, teachings, or doctrines. It is a product of the Body's need. There is only one Body. What is manifested in all the places is the same life. This life is the reality of the Body. The work is produced out of this reality. This is the Lord's standard. If we compare our work with the Lord's standard, we will see that we have surely come short. The Lord has shown us today that individual works can never come up to the standard of the Body. If we do not see this, insisting instead on our individual works, we will face a stone wall. All works that are not the issue of the Body life will sooner or later hit a stone wall. The Lord will lead us to the point where we have to take the way of the Body. He will lead us to the point where we will not be able to go on or even to live if we do not take the way of the Body. If a man falls into the river, surely he will cry out for help. In the same way, the Lord will force us to cry out for help to be rescued out of our individual works. This is the starting point of the work. The starting point of the work is the oneness of the Body.</p><p>The electricity that comes from the power plant is one, yet the places where it shines are many. Although it shines in many places, the electricity in these many places is under the control of the same power plant. Today the works in all the localities should be under the fellowship of the one Body. No place should set up its own bunker or defense line. Today we should express the life of the Body in the different localities. If we make the churches in our localities little kingdoms and territories bounded by their own "turf,'' we are wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO LINES OF THE WORK</h2><p>In the Bible there are only two groups of workers. Other than these two groups, God did not have His eyes on any other institution of Christian work. These two groups of workers are the group from Jerusalem and the group from Antioch. In addition to these two groups, there were other workers. For example, the book of Philippians mentions some others who preached Christ (1:15-17). Yet the Lord did not pay much attention to these ones; He only paid attention to the workers from Jerusalem and those from Antioch. Since the Bible pays little attention to these other ones, we pay little attention to them also. The Lord emphatically placed two lines in the Bible, composed of two groups of workers, the line of Paul and the line of Peter. For this reason, we have to be clear about these two lines.</p><h2 class="head1">ORGANIZATION BEING THE RESULT<br />OF THE LACK OF LIFE</h2><p>The reason there are headquarters is that there is the lack of life. Once life is lacking, organization comes in. In the Body of Christ, organization is the heaviest burden. When a person is healthy, he does not feel the weight of his body. Once a person is ill, he feels the weight of his body. The more a person is ill, the heavier his body is to him. When a person dies, his body becomes the heaviest. It becomes so heavy that he has to be lifted up by others. When there is life, the body is a body. When life is gone, the body becomes a corpse. In the same principle, without life, headquarters appear. Once life is gone, there is the need for an organization to come in to arrange everything. As long as there is life in the Body of Christ, it will not be a problem even if this Body becomes very large. This is like saying that as long as there is life in the human body, a person does not feel the weight of his body no matter how heavy and big it becomes. But as soon as his body becomes a corpse, it becomes very difficult to lift.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCHES NOT BECOMING A METHOD</h2><p>Today we cannot make the truth concerning the local churches a method. If we make it a method, it will become very dead indeed. The question is not Catholicism or local churches. The question is whether the church is in doctrine or in life. I fear method as much as I fear Catholicism. The local church cannot become a method. Once it becomes a method, it will become very, very heavy. This is our basic problem today.</p><p>We cannot say that the Catholic Church is all wrong. If the Catholic Church would remove her idols, the oneness that she talks about would be right.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING "HANDING OVER''</h2><p>I still need to say something concerning the question of "handing over.''</p><h2 class="head2">Handing Over Being a Make-up Lesson<br />and Not a Teaching</h2><p>The matter of "handing over'' must never become our teaching. It is not a teaching, but a "make-up'' lesson. There is the need for this make-up lesson because the matter was not taken care of properly at the beginning. It is like a man riding on a train: he should first buy the ticket and then board the train. However, some people have boarded the train without paying for the ticket. As a result, there is the need for some kind of make-up measure. Tickets should be bought at the train station. After a man is saved, he should immediately consecrate himself (Rom. 6:6, 12-13), and he should not wait until a later date to make it up. But many Christians have not done this properly, and the church has not properly presented this need from the beginning. We can say that the church has given the believers a "bonus ride''; they boarded the train without paying for the ticket. But sooner or later, they still must pay for the ticket.</p><p>For the new ones who have just come in, we do not need to ask them to hand themselves over. What they need is to consecrate themselves. There is a "handing over'' because their consecration was not done properly at the beginning. As a result, there is the need for such a make-up lesson. The standard of salvation is not high enough today, and many of the items a person should have acquired at the time of salvation have been lost. Strictly speaking, when a man is saved, he should be fully consecrated and should fully live for the spread of the gospel. As soon as a person comes in, we should lay the full demand on his shoulder. If we can do this, no one among us will still hold hands with the world after they are saved, nor will they have to come back at a later date to consecrate themselves.</p><p>When men thronged to follow the Lord in the Gospels, He presented His requirements to them. He explained that a man must take up his own cross before he can follow Him (Matt. 10:38; 16:24). The Lord never lowers His standard. On the contrary, He lifts the standard high. He says that man should follow Him, and that if a man is to follow Him, he has to do this and that. Let me emphasize that a man cannot go on after he is saved unless he consecrates himself. Unless he takes up his cross, he cannot go on. If we want to come to the Lord, we have to consecrate ourselves, and we have to take up our cross and give up the world and our individualism. All these things must be clearly dealt with when a person is saved.</p><p>The matter of "handing oneself over'' is a measure taken because nothing else can be done. It is like a man riding a train without a ticket. Since he cannot get off the train, the only way is for him to buy a ticket then. For now, we have settled for the term "handing over.'' One day, when everyone is consecrated as soon as he is saved, there will be no further need for anyone to "hand themselves over.'' But the things that should have been done on the first day have been lost. Everyone has boarded the train without a ticket; some have climbed into the carriages through the windows, while others have walked in without a ticket. Although they have boarded the train without a ticket, they cannot go on with their free ride indefinitely. Sooner or later, they will have to pay for their ticket. There is a difference between buying a ticket on the train and buying it at the station. Buying a ticket on the train is abnormal, whereas buying it at the station is normal. If everyone bought his ticket on the train, there would be no need for a ticket booth at the station. If everyone buys his ticket on the train, the ticket booth might just as well be moved into the train.</p><p>I am afraid that after some time the matter of "handing over'' will become a new terminology among us. It is possible that in the future the matter of "handing over'' will become a peculiar thing among us. If this happens, those teachers who come after us will write and ask us about the scriptural foundation for the practice of "handing oneself over.'' There is no such doctrinal term as "handing over.'' We borrow this term today because men do not have a proper and good beginning. If everyone begins in a proper way, there is no need to bring up this question any longer.</p><h2 class="head2">A Proper Start for the New Believers</h2><p>There is a big difference between a proper salvation and an improper salvation. One woman can give birth to a twelve-ounce baby, whereas another can give birth to a twelve-pound baby. The church should bear the responsibility in its ministry to help the new ones have a good beginning. There is a great difference between the way taken by those who have a proper beginning and those who do not. Among those raised up by the Lord throughout the ages, many have not had a good beginning. Once a person has a good beginning, he can go on in a proper way. As long as the beginning is clear-cut, he can go on properly no matter how little he understands and sees at the beginning. There are others who dragged their feet when they first came in. With such, their way cannot be straight. Once a person is saved, he should have a clear-cut separation from sin and the world. The question of money has to be settled. The question of consecration has to be settled, and the question of individualism also has to be settled. What the future holds for a person depends on God. After Paul brought others to salvation, he committed those who were saved to the grace of God (Acts 14:23; 20:32). There is no doubt that a person needs God's grace in the way ahead, but in the initial stage, there must be a clear-cut salvation. If the beginning is not good, the make-up lesson later will not be easy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Work<br />of the Holy Spirit in the Gospel</h2><p>Brother Tang: Is it one thing to go to God and another thing to go before man?</p><p>Brother Nee: There are six lines to take in preaching the gospel. One can start from love, righteousness, judgment, sin, the world, or vanity. However, no matter which line you take, there is the need of the work of the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is just one thing: to subdue a person. The real gospel is one that subdues and softens a person. All those who think that they are doing God a favor by believing in Him are unqualified ones. Once a person sees the gospel, whether it is through the preaching of love, righteousness, or judgment, he will surely be softened and subdued.</p><h2 class="head2">The Center of the Gospel Being God</h2><p>When we preach the gospel, we have to present the proper way to others. The question of the world and our service to the Lord must be dealt with together. We have to see that the center of the gospel is God, not ourselves. It is not that we gain something for ourselves, but that God gains something for Himself. As soon as a person is saved, he has to realize that everything belongs to God. Our occupations are not ours; they are God's. The doctors have to see that their occupation is not to be a doctor, but to serve God. They are only working as a doctor on the side. If a man is not willing to take this way or to accept the Lord and be baptized, we will not force him to do so. But we cannot lower the standard. As soon as a person is saved, we have to tell him that from now on he is no longer an individual person, but a member in the Body. As such, he needs to learn to listen to others and to submit to others.</p><p>If the church will not take this way, it will always remain substandard. If Brother Tang drinks cow's milk today, no one will laugh at him. But if he still took his mother's milk, it would be a big joke. Strictly speaking, the church should have learned obedience already. But now it is going back to re-learn this lesson. Therefore, in order to take the straight way today, we have to put everything upon a person the day that he is saved. Those who are saved must begin in a proper way.</p><h2 class="head2">A Minister of the Gospel Being<br />One Who Lives the Gospel</h2><p>We must be a certain kind of person before we can produce that kind of person. The gospel demands not only that we preach it, but that we live it. The gospel not only must be heard, but also must be seen. No preaching can match the act of a martyr. More people are gained through an act of martyrdom than through the work of preaching.</p><p>There was a sister who was nineteen or twenty years old. For the Lord's sake, she was banished to Siberia. On her way in the train, she comforted her family and said to them, "Do not cry for me. Cry instead for those who do not have God. What I have far exceeds what they have. I am happy to suffer for the sake of my beloved Lord. The suffering that I endure can never match that of my Lord.'' A young thirteen-year-old boy sitting close by heard this word, and he was greatly moved to believe in the Lord. Later, he became one of the great workers used by the Lord in southern Czarist Russia.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Impact in the Gospel</h2><p>Strictly speaking, we need men of Acts 2 before we can have messages of Acts 2. What we have to do today is not simply preach, but have an impact on others. If we preach the gospel in this way, a fleshly man will not even be able to come into the church, let alone to go on afterwards. If there are such men and there are those who live this kind of life, corporately there will be the impact and the influence, and others will catch on to the warmth and the joy. Life is a matter of consciousness and feeling. With some people, you can only shake their hands; you cannot touch their spirit or their real person. If a person has the things of God, others will only sense the things of God in him. If a person has the life of God, others will sense the life of God in him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY BEING A MATTER<br />OF THE INWARD BURDEN</h2><p>All proper ministers are burdened with a message. If a man has a ministry, he will always be burdened with a few strong words that remain with him. These few words become his burden. Sometimes the burden may appear very small, but the more the person explains it, the more words there will be. It is like woolen yarn; the more you pull it, the more yarn you see. Any ministry that is of any worth is a ministry with a burden. Within the ministry there is a specific burden.</p><p>When some people are preaching on the podium, their minds are always spinning. With others, only empty words come out of them. When others listen to their words, they do not receive any Spirit; they only receive sounds. All real ministries have a burden within their words. The ones speaking may come feeling heavy, but they should leave feeling light. When they speak, they speak with a burden from within. If a man does not have a burden, any preaching he conducts with his mind and thoughts will be useless. A ministry must have a ministry's burden. The greatest suffering is for a person to come with something but find no one picking up his words. In the end he carries back the same burden that he brought with him.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MOVE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2><p>The problem of the move of the local churches must be solved in the Body. It is useless to try to solve it separately. The Lord must first have a way among us. Only when He has a way among us will He have a way among the churches. If He does not get through with us, He will not be able to solve the problems separately in the different localities.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TODAY</h2><h2 class="head2">Committing Oneself to the Body</h2><p>I see clearly that with our present condition, we need a second salvation. This is a great matter. The term "handing over'' is only our borrowed term. I do not wish that it be taken by others and used as standard terminology. Originally, man was rebellious, individualistic, and unwilling to hand himself over. Now through the work of the Lord, he is willing to drop everything and hand himself over voluntarily. Today, if a man wants to hand himself over willingly, he has to do it; and if he does not want to hand himself over, he nevertheless has to do it. Some may think that they cannot hand themselves over, but they should go ahead and try. Once a sacrifice is on the altar, the altar will sanctify the sacrifice. This is like some people saying that they cannot believe and that they have too many questions. But once they decide to believe, all their questions are solved. A person can believe even though he has many doubts and questions. As long as a person is willing, God can work on him. If a man thinks that he cannot hand himself over, all he has to do is to place himself in the church. The church will help him become able. If an individual has some problem, he can ask for help from the church; a few others can come along to help him to hand himself over. Today, as long as man makes a little move, God will move along with him. The handing over that we speak of today is not an individual handing over, but a handing over that is done in fellowship. Such handing over is a kind of committing of ourselves. It may seem that a person is only putting himself on the altar on a trial basis, and it may seem that God is only accepting such a one on a trial basis. Actually, whether or not a man considers his move a trial effort, God takes it seriously. He takes those who do it wholeheartedly, and He also takes those who do it halfheartedly. Today, when we hand ourselves over, we are committing ourselves to the Body. The Body is our greatest protection. In the coming days we shall see that those who do not live in the Body will suffer great loss. The supply of the ministry is in the Body. Once we are separated from the Body, we are cut off from the supply of the ministry.</p><h2 class="head2">Realizing the Supply of the Body</h2><p>The book of Acts indicates that when Paul was in Athens, he was provoked in his spirit and ill at ease (17:16). Yet when Timothy joined him in Corinth, he immediately received the supply (18:5). This is like a certain brother passing by your locality or a new one joining your meeting. Immediately, you can feel the supply. Sometimes, when a few brothers visit a locality, the supply follows them wherever they go. The brothers may not even need to say anything. All they have to do is to sit there, and the supply is there. A speaker will be able to release his burden as long as there is the proper audience. The thing that causes the most suffering is for a person to come with a burden and to go home with the same burden.</p><p>Since we are a Body, we affect one another. However, we are not very clear how we affect one another. Sometimes we feel that our fellowship with the Lord is particularly intimate. At other times we have some inexplicable feelings. The basis for these phenomena is the existence of a supply in the Body. There is a supply in the Body life. This supply is a reality. However, we do not know how this supply affects the members. In the Body we should not be a brother or sister who just consumes others' supply; we should have a clear realization of the Body. All our failures and weaknesses today are due to the fact that we behave as individual Christians. There are some things that we cannot explain very clearly today. In the days ahead perhaps there will be the opportunity for us to speak about them in a clearer and more precise way.</p><p>During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, many Christians were martyred. At the same time many churches around the world had the feeling that something was happening. Many people were depressed in their spirit for many days, and they felt the need for prayer. This feeling was not something that came from physical eyes or ears. It was a feeling of the Body. Who can say that the faithful martyrs were not supplied during those hours by the effect of these prayers? Miss Barber was in England at that time, and she was oppressed in her spirit. She felt the need to pray. She found out what had happened soon after.</p><p>Whenever one part of our body becomes sick, the other parts of the body come to the member's aid and try to deal with the sickness. In the same way there is a supply in the Body of Christ. The Body life is not a term, but a reality. Many people think that the church is only a mysterious and abstract Body. They do not realize that this Body is a reality.</p><p>First Corinthians 11:29 speaks of discerning "the body.'' The Body denotes two things: the Lord's body and the Body of Christ. Verse 29 speaks of the body without making reference to either the Lord's body or the Body of Christ. Therefore, it refers to the Lord's body on the one hand, and to the Body of Christ on the other hand. Within this Body there are the riches of the Lord, and there are the riches of Christ. Every Christian can receive the benefits of the Holy Spirit and of the Lord's grace in this Body. The greatest lack among Christians today is the lack of the supply of the Body. May the Lord open our eyes to see this Body and to realize the supply in this Body.</p><h2 class="head1">PRINCIPLES OF OFFERING</h2><p>Let us also consider the principles of offering.</p><h2 class="head2">Material Offerings&mdash;<br />Not a Matter of Amount,<br />but a Question of Where the Heart Lies</h2><p>The Bible speaks about offerings with respect to a few things. The first is material offerings. There is no set principle as to the amount one should offer. Some offer more; others offer less. Some time ago, a few brothers in Ku-Tien sold all their possessions. At that time I temporarily stopped them from doing this. There is no set principle to offering. Some offer everything they have. Christ says that a man must sell everything to follow Him. John the Baptist said that those who have two tunics should give one away (Luke 3:11). The Gospels tell us to care for the poor. In the Epistles we see that the church should care for the widows among us. However, a person must first care for his own household (1 Tim. 5:16, 8). Second Corinthians 8:15 says, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.''</p><p>The problem today is not how much a person should offer, but the fact that money has laid hold of man's heart. In God's work no one can keep his money on the one hand and say that his heart loves the Lord on the other hand. The Bible says that where our treasure is, there our hearts are also (Matt. 6:21). In order for our hearts not to be ensnared by money, we have to let money go. If money goes out of our pocket, the heart goes out with it. If a man loves the Lord, he will be able to choose voluntary poverty. Voluntary poverty is the way for the heart to be released. Sometimes God will ask a person to sell all he has. Sometimes He will only ask a person to give what he has in excess. Whatever it may be, the heart has to be released. In Acts the apostle rebuked Ananias for keeping back what he had in excess (5:3-4). Today we should not have anything in excess. To have anything in excess is a shame in the church. The church should not see any excess. If there is any excess, it should be given away.</p><p>Sister Eva said that every time she went to bed, she would always consider how she could save something more from her spending in order that others could receive more. We need to take care of our livelihood, and we need to take care of our family. But that is not the issue today. As long as we set aside a portion from our income and lower our standard of living a little, we will be able to give away our excess.</p><p>Today, when we speak of handing ourselves over, we are not talking about what we have to do to take care of our money. Rather, we are saying that a person has to offer himself up for the Lord and for the gospel. Brothers and sisters who are engaged in an occupation, the Lord needs your ministry in your job! These few years we have been short of new co-workers. Formerly, at the peak we had about four hundred co-workers. Today we only have about two hundred; we are about two hundred short. In order to fill up the gap of these two hundred workers, there must be a group of people who would go to make money. Formerly, I dared not say such a word. But today I dare to say such a word. Some should go to make money and offer their money to the Lord's service. They should consecrate themselves to make money for the Lord's service. Perhaps such a one can make a million dollars, taking only what he needs to sustain his livelihood and giving the rest to the church. If you are only a spectator here, nothing will happen to you. But if you want to give yourselves for the co-workers' needs, it demands your life.</p><p>Of course, God does not want us to go to extremes. He wants us to be in moderation. First He wants us; then He wants what is ours. We have to come to Him first before we can bring what we have to Him. If we do not come, God will not accept what we have. All the brothers and sisters have to see that everything is for the Lord and that everything has to center around the Lord. We must have the same center. Although some function in their money-making ministry while others function in their ministry of the word, the center for both must be the same.</p><h2 class="head2">Offering Up Our Occupation&mdash;<br />Taking Up Occupations Approved by God</h2><p>Other than material offerings, the Bible also speaks of the offering up of our occupations. The Bible shows us that many occupations are not suitable for a Christian to engage in. It is true that we have to make money, but we have to consider how our money is made. Some means of making money are not approved by the Lord. We can only keep the occupations that God approves, and we can never engage in works that God does not approve. Today some leading ones in some localities have wrong concepts about occupations. They bring these wrong concepts to the church. As a result, the church is ill-affected. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>The Lord of all our works, we beseech for men on behalf of the church. Today the church is in a state of desolation. There is a lack of men in the church. May You grant us men, and may the church be filled with men. Give many gifts to the church. Be merciful to us so that there will be consecrated ones who will hand themselves over. May we find men who would submit under Your mighty hand so that we can serve You together with all the saints. In this age of desolation, we ask especially that You raise up not just young ones or co-workers, but a church that would uphold Your testimony. May more people put themselves into Your hands so that their jobs, positions, and living can become worthy of the gospel. May there be young ones raised up to work for You, and may all the brothers and sisters rise up to match the move of the gospel. We believe that You can fulfill the work of Your recovery. May You do a greater work, and may You raise up more men to give all their time to serve You and to go out with the gospel. We ask that You raise up a great multitude of men. We are not asking first for their money or their time. We are asking for their whole person. May there be some who would offer themselves to You in a thorough way, and may they do it right now. We pray that You would remove the desolation from us and give us men. Lord, be gracious to us; we are inquiring of You for men. Only You are worthy to gain us. Only You can cause us to serve You unreservedly and singleheartedly. We would pour out the water of the well of Bethlehem here on the ground. May none among us be a withdrawing one, a hiding one, or a spectator. May You be merciful to us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">TESTIMONIES OF CO-WORKERS<br />AND COMMENTS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 13, 1948, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>Brother Watchman Nee: In tonight's meeting we would like the co-workers to give their own testimonies. Those brothers and sisters who are joining us as guests should only come with their ears. They should not be mouths, nor should they take what they hear and use it as subjects for gossip. Tonight we want to speak honest words before the Lord and speak the truth in love.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING CONTROLLED BY EMOTIONS</h2><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi: (1) I find it easy for me to lose my temper and to criticize; (2) I always have strong feelings for injustice in others.</p><p>Brother Nee: Brother Chang is easily swayed by his emotions. He does not have much problem with his will. We cannot be influenced by our emotions. What we learn in sickness is a discipline from God through our environment.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DIRECT AND SIMPLE IN ONE'S MIND</h2><p>Brother David Hsu: (1) I always experience conflicts of various kinds; (2) whenever something happens, I fall into much consideration and my thoughts become very complicated; (3) I also experience conflict between my heart and head.</p><p>Brother Nee: We should have thoughts that are like straight lines. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. We should not have circumventing thoughts. Once light comes in and we see ourselves, we should apply the dealing right away. If we do this, our mind will become simple.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Definite Burden in Our Spirit<br />and Speaking into Others' Spirit</h2><p>In serving the Lord, we have to seek for definite burdens in our spirit. We must have the Lord's words within before we can speak His word without. Our words are not just spoken for the ears of others. The real speaking is one in which deep calls unto deep. On the one hand, we should have the spiritual burden within us. On the other hand, our words should be conveyed to the depths of others.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Our Speaking<br />to Be Short and Direct</h2><p>The problem with Brother Hsu is the conveying. I have no way of knowing how much burden there is within him. However, he has used so many words and so much time, and yet that which is in his spirit is not yet conveyed to others. This is because there is not enough practice. As a result, his mind is poor. When we speak, our words have to be short and simple. Brother Hsu's problem is not a problem in the basic matter; it is a problem with his speaking. If he practices more, he will avoid the complications and hesitations. Brother Witness Lee's prayers are "light'' in time and "heavy" in content. If a man needs a glass of water, simply give him a glass. There is no need to lay a fifty-yard pipeline first and then put the glass to it.</p><p>It is not easy for you to take such words. It is not easy for me to speak such words either.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A STRONG SPIRIT<br />TO RENDER OTHERS THE PRACTICAL HELP</h2><p>Brother Jih Yung-tung: I am learning to mingle myself with the other co-workers, but sometimes I become withdrawn because of others.</p><p>Brother Nee: Brother Jih needs to be strengthened in his spirit. Real love for the brothers has to do with our being absolute toward the Lord. This requires that our spirit be strong. Those who do not have a strong spirit cannot render others much help in the church. They cannot build others up, and they cannot cause others to waste themselves on the Lord. Only those who have a strong spirit can render others the greatest amount of help. We should not give others fragmentary and defective help. Rather, we should render them practical and definite help. This requires a strong spirit on our part.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING<br />AND THE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 14, 1948, morning<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">OPEN TO RECEIVE THE SUPPLY OF THE MINISTRY</h2><p>Brother Nee: In the past there were many things that we could not say or do, because we were not open to one another. When over twenty brothers recently handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I was not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others. When a man has handed himself over, his position changes. There is the need for a certain degree of openness before there can be the capacity to receive a certain kind of word.</p><p>The first need today among the co-workers is to learn to be open. What we did last night [referring to the comments by the co-workers, see chapter eight] can only be done when there is openness. There are some things that we can say; there are other things that we cannot say. It is a question of position. It is a question of whether or not a person has the position to say certain kinds of words. It is also a question of motive and relationship. When you want to say something, you have to check whether your motive is right. You also must ask what kind of relationship you have with your listener. Different relationships mean that our words have to be different. In addition, we have to speak in love. Without love, we cannot speak honest words.</p><p>We have been nodding our heads and patting each other on the back for over ten years. Yet there are still many things that we dare not open up to one another. We dare not speak about these things ourselves, and others dare not speak about them either. Outsiders may not know about these problems, but we have been clear about them for a long time. We know that there are some things that we cannot say or that are hard to say.</p><p>The problem today is that the members do not want to receive the supply from others. Once a member refuses to receive the supply, all ministries stop. When some people come across difficulties, they refuse to receive the supply from others. Instead, they will only accept exhortations and supplies from those who are three miles away from them. To have to say something under such circumstances does not even touch the surface of the issue; much less can there be any deep or open words. The need today is for us to put ourselves under the authority of the Head. If a man sees the Body, he will not be hurt or caused to stumble. What is needed among the brothers and sisters is not friendship, cordiality, or tactfulness. None of these things exists in the Body.</p><p>Among us in the past, we had the supply. Yet it could not flow out even though the supply was present. In the coming days we have to look to God for mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE MINISTRY AND THE MINISTRIES</h2><p>Specifically, every brother and sister must understand the need of authority in the local churches. Romans 12 speaks of ministries, and Ephesians 4 speaks of the ministry. The ministry in these two places is different. The "ministry" in Ephesians 4 is singular; it is the same ministry as the apostles' ministry of the word and prayer as recorded in Acts 6. The ministry in Ephesians is "the ministry"; it is unique, and it refers to the ministry of the word, which includes the five kinds of gifts in that chapter. The ministries in Romans 12 are manifold; they are plural in number. Not everyone has a part in the ministry of the word. Only the apostles and the prophets have a part in this ministry. However, every child of God has a share in the ministries of Romans 12. In the local churches all the brothers and sisters have a part in these ministries. Every member has to consider himself and work according to his measure.</p><p>The beginning of Romans 12 speaks of God's mercy. This mercy includes chapters one to eleven. Chapters one to eight cover sanctification, and chapters nine to eleven say that it is not of the one who wills nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy. Chapter twelve goes on to speak about God's mercy. This mercy produces a result, which is consecration. The goal of consecration is for the ministries, which is not to be a preacher, but to serve God. Service is ministry and ministry is service. The words service and ministry are the same word in Greek. This service is like the service of the priests in the Old Testament. There the ones who served at the altar partook of the food of the altar (1 Cor. 9:13).</p><p>A cook can prepare food in the kitchen, but he does not serve the food himself. Rather, the waiter serves the food at the table. This is a picture of the ministry. A ministry is the work of bringing food from one place to another. Originally, the food was far away from you. But now the ministering one brings the food to you, and you can enjoy the food. Those who are serving receive the supply from the Head on the one hand and minister this supply to the brothers and sisters on the other hand. A man receives his ministry from God. He receives such a ministry for the purpose of serving the brothers and sisters and the church. When the brothers and sisters serve together in a local church, everyone should put in his or her portion. This is a different kind of service. Such service cannot be replaced by the ministry. What Acts 6 talks about is a different matter.</p><h2 class="head1">GAINING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES</h2><p>There are two reasons that there is little supply among the brothers and sisters in the local churches. First, there are works of the flesh, and second, the saints have not learned the lesson of submitting to the authority in the church. Because there is the flesh, the responsible brothers are hesitant to let the fleshly ones function, for fear that they will do more damage than good. This actually helps the one-talented ones to bury their gifts. In the end the church neither suffers a loss nor brings in a profit. The flesh does not come any longer, but neither do the one-talented ones come. Today we have to turn the situation around. We can no longer despise the one-talented ones. We have to gain these one-talented ones. Of course, when the one-talented ones come, the flesh comes with them also. But we should not be afraid of this.</p><p>What is the church? The church is all the one-talented ones functioning. When all the dumb ones open their mouths, when all the brothers and sisters speak, and when all the one-talented ones are functioning, we have the church. What we need today is not just the "minister of ministers,'' but the whole church. Here, not only do we have the ministry of the word, but we have all kinds of services. We must never allow the one-talented ones to bury their talents.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE AUTHORITY<br />AND DEALING WITH THE FLESH</h2><p>There is indeed the need for the recovery of authority. The recovery of authority is for dealing with the flesh. All the brothers and sisters have to rise up. Although they may only have one talent, they still have to rise up. Wherever the one-talented ones are placed together, there is surely the flesh. When the flesh comes in, there is the need to have the authority of the church. Some will exercise their flesh, and they will have to be told that the way they laugh, for example, is wrong, and that they should not do this. Hence, on the one hand, authority has to be recovered. This will safeguard the church. On the other hand, we still have to encourage the saints to speak. If we do not practice this, everyone will become silent when we lay down the principle of forbidding the flesh, and the services will become the work of a few again.</p><p>Everyone has to participate in the services. We cannot allow one or two to be passive. We oppose the system of pastors. It is wrong to have one pastor, and it is equally wrong to have ten pastors in place of one. We cannot tolerate one man, and we cannot tolerate a few men either. Today we have to deal thoroughly with the one-talented ones. It is wrong for the one-talented ones to hide themselves. We cannot tolerate one group of people serving while another group of people is not serving. All the local churches have to make a full turn in this matter. The responsible ones and the co-workers must first be coordinated before they will have the strength to deal with the flesh in the church and before they can deal with all the rebellious, disobedient, and insubordinate brothers and sisters. Only then can the authority of the church be established. In another five years, you will realize what I mean today.</p><h2 class="head1">UPLIFTING THE SPIRITUAL STANDARD<br />AND ESTABLISHING CHURCH AUTHORITY</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: The situation today is that only a few co-workers and responsible brothers and sisters are serving. We have not brought everyone into the services yet. There are many reasons for this. Immaturity in life and the lack of love hinders some from coming into the services. The poverty of their spiritual condition bars others from the services. The condition of the brothers and sisters is such that they are merely saved. In many cases their salvation experiences are even weak experiences of salvation; they do not have rich and absolute cases of salvation. Many only come for a Sunday morning "service,'' and they are not properly recovered yet. We are weak in all the areas, and authority among us has not been established or built up.</p><p>Once our standard is low, church services become a matter of position or organization. Today the condition among the saints is poor, but the responsibility is not on them; it is on the responsible ones. The responsible ones have to bear eighty to ninety percent of the responsibility. Today the saints are fully influenced by the co-workers. If the spiritual condition of the co-workers is high, the spiritual condition of the saints is high. If the spiritual condition of the responsible ones is progressive, the spiritual condition of the saints is also progressive. Those who are in authority need to have not only the position, but even more, the life. Aaron's rod represents authority on the one hand and life on the other hand; it is a budding rod (Num. 17:8). If life is not expressed in authority, this authority is a mere positional authority. If life is expressed, it is easy for authority to be executed. An authority that is without life is an empty authority. This is like some so-called governments that apparently have authority, but whose laws cannot be exercised beyond their own buildings.</p><p>Unless we build up the authority of the church, our work today is a failure. If we do not build up the authority, there will be no way for the brothers and sisters to be built up. If there is no authority in the church, where will the brothers and sisters go for the proper authority to submit to? The condition of the churches today is like a pile of stones; there is no building up. The situation among us is one in which not one stone lies on top of another. Today no one is above anyone else. If authority is built up among us, the services will be built up also. When we are built up under the proper authority, the services will be produced.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMITTING TO AUTHORITY<br />AND COORDINATING IN SERVICE</h2><p>There is only one mouth in the human body. There is only one place where orders are issued. All the other places only need to follow the orders. Mopping the floor is a small thing. Yet, in doing such a small thing, a person must nevertheless ask the church. This is real coordination. A man is built up through serving in the church. If you have to ask someone about something, that someone is spontaneously the authority above you. With authority, there are orders. Without authority, there can be no orders, and without orders, there cannot be those who follow the orders. However, the presence of proper services always proves that authority is there, and under these circumstances, a model of the Body will emerge.</p><p>Whether or not local authority is built up depends on the presence of authority in the work. If the coordination among the co-workers is not smooth, you cannot expect the coordination among the brothers and sisters to be smooth. The crux of the matter today is the coordination among the co-workers. This is our biggest problem.</p><p>I have met with Brother Nee many times. I constantly have the feeling that Brother Nee's ministry must be recovered among us. During the past year and a half, we have discussed this matter many times. Once there is coordination in the work, the local churches will be able to send people out and there will be an increase in quantity and quality. Today the preaching of the gospel should be a work in the Body. Men remain unsaved because they have not yet seen the power of the church. Once the Body appears, there will be the real recovery. Today we cannot say that we are fully recovered yet. In short, if Brother Nee does not resume his ministry, nothing will happen. If real coordination is not established in the work, we cannot expect the local churches to have the real services. If such is the case, there will still be the system of the Nicolaitans; we still will not see the whole Body rising up to serve, and we will still be left with a few serving.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS<br />AND TO BE SUBMISSIVE IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>Brother Nee: My personal ministry is to serve as a minister of the ministers; I am here to serve the ministers. My own work seldom touches the brothers and sisters directly. Concerning the work, I have much to say. Concerning the brothers and sisters, I have very little to say.</p><p>In the church a person has to learn to ask everything. Once there is the asking, the services will be produced. If a brother mops the floor in the church for two years and is still the same, he should not come any longer. He has to mop the floor to the extent that he becomes a different person. In the church the main emphasis is not to get the work done, but to learn to be the proper person through doing the work. Every time we engage in any work, we have to learn coordination, and we have to ask the church about everything. We should not propose anything; rather, we should learn to submit. Those who have the ministry are responsible for speaking up, and others are responsible for putting aside their own ideas. Everyone has to learn to submit under the Head.</p><p>If the church does not learn this lesson, it will become the same as the denominations and other social groups. Everything in the church is under God's authority. Not only should the responsible ones learn to give orders, but the brothers and sisters also should learn to follow orders. The responsible ones have to learn to speak, and they also have to learn not to speak. Whether they speak or do not speak, they have to live under the authority of the Head. Living the church life demands our very life. The first thing we have to do is not to think, but to submit. The saints should present all the problems to the elders, and the elders should present the problems before God. In this way the saints can come to God through the elders, and God's authority can be realized among the saints.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING AND EDIFYING THOSE<br />WHO ARE RICH AND IN HIGH POSITIONS</h2><p>We have to let the rich ones and those in high positions see that the church does not beg for their services. Who is begging for their services? There are others who can do things better than they can. But we have to let them see that we allow them to serve for the purpose of perfecting and edifying them. In addition, we have to help them to care for the poor in material things. We have to help the saints who occupy high positions to step down from their heights and to open up their wallets so that God can edify all.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH<br />PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In the matter of preaching the gospel, we have to recover the kind of preaching that is done by the whole church. We do not need to invite people with big advertisements. Rather, we should ask all the brothers and sisters to invite people individually. There is a difference between inviting people through advertisements and inviting them individually through the brothers and sisters. In this way the whole church will be able to rise up to serve. This kind of service will be the whole Body serving together. If we have only a few serving today, we have not reached God's standard.</p><p>The way to go on today is to have authority plus the one-talented ones. When authority is added to the one-talented ones, we have the church. Whether or not a church is up to the standard depends on whether the one-talented one are functioning. It is not enough just to have the two and five-talented ones. If our work does not bring out the one-talented ones, our work is a failure.</p><p>The flesh always comes with the one-talented ones. Before we have learned obedience ourselves, we will not know whether others are obeying or not. But after we have learned obedience, we will detect disobedience as soon as it is present. If we are coordinated, there will be authority among us. With authority we can deal with the rebellious and the insubordinate.</p><p>Our co-workers have been working and laboring all this time. I would like to ask if they feel tired? Perhaps God is telling us to let go now. The way today is not to struggle individually by ourselves. The way today is to do things all together and in coordination. The church is the reservoir of Christ; all the riches of Christ are stored in the Body. If one day we see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel, we will realize what a beautiful and powerful picture it is.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING THE WAY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH SERVING</h2><p>Today very few spiritual giants are being produced any longer. In the last century during the Keswick movement, many spiritual giants were produced. At that time people had a very shallow knowledge about the Bible. When A. T. Pierson stood up to preach, very few people knew what he was talking about. Today man's knowledge about the Bible has increased. When a person steps up to the platform to preach today, he only needs to speak the first sentence, and everyone knows what will follow. Today there are very few five-talented ones like Paul. However, although there are very few spiritual giants, two or three one-talented ones and two-talented ones will make up for a Paul. Today we do not have many Pauls. We can no longer wait for spiritual giants to come to us. I believe the time has come for the church to rise up to serve, work, and preach the gospel. There is no way for us to go on individually any longer. This is the time for us to take the way of the church. We have to be in the same mind with God. We criticize the denominations and their system of one man monopolizing everything, but in the local churches, one co-worker plus two or three elders monopolize the services. They are replacing the functions of the saints. In principle this is the same as the denominations.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />AND COMMITTING THE WORK TO THEM</h2><p>Our work today is one in which we perfect others to do the work themselves. We are not here to work for others. Paul produced a Timothy to be his disciple. Timothy then committed the work to faithful ones (2 Tim. 2:2). The faithful ones went out and perfected others more. This is the way of our work today.</p><p>But now we are doing the work for others. This kind of working for others will not bring about anything even if we work ourselves to the point that we contract tuberculosis. The way today is to teach others to work. Only those who can teach others to work will succeed in the work.</p><p>When a person takes all the work upon himself, he is in reality telling everyone else not to work. This is the wrong way. The work of the co-workers today is to lead others and to induce them to work. Their job is to distribute the work to others. They have to use whatever means they can to cause others to work.</p><p>An older brother who is now deceased was working in the navy. He told me once that when the gunboats are engaged in battle, the cannons are carried from the bottom of the boats to the deck and handed to the gunners. The gunners themselves do not carry the cannons. This brother told me that he had worked for many years on a gunboat, but he had never fired a shot himself. All the time he carried cannons for others to fire the shots. Today we have to be that kind of people. We have to bring the cannons to the brothers and sisters and let them fire the shots.</p><p>One day we will all pass away, and another generation will rise up. The next generation that we bring in must not be made up of three or five serving ones, but must be made up of the whole church serving. If one day the whole church rises up to do everything by itself, with the whole church preaching the gospel and the whole church edifying each other, that will be the day when the world will see the church doing a new thing on earth. Today the whole problem lies with you and me. We must help every brother and sister to serve and make everyone a priest of God. Some may have the flesh with them, but we still have to ask them to work. Some brothers say that what they have is so little that it would be better if they hid it. But we have to tell them that they cannot do this. It is an easy thing for the one-talented ones to hide what they have. Many brothers and sisters feel that since they make mistakes no matter how they work, they may as well not work at all. But we have to ask them to work. This is the way. Please believe my words. In the not-too-distant future such a church will appear. By that time men will see Philadelphia, the genuine brotherly love.</p><h2 class="head1">ALLOWING GOD TO HAVE A WAY AMONG US</h2><p>Today the responsibility rests on our shoulders. God must have a way with us first, before He can have a way in the church. Everywhere God is recovering the condition of the early churches. From the garden of Eden through the tabernacle and the temple, God is gaining the church, which will usher in the holy city. By that time God will be able to dwell in the city, and Satan will no longer be able to come into that place.</p><h2 class="head1">USHERING IN THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: In the last century many spiritual giants were raised up. But today it seems as if there are no such giants. I believe the reason for this is that God wants to bring in the ministry of the church and the service of the church. In China and even in the whole world, there seem to be no great evangelists being raised up. Not only are there no new ones being raised up, but the old ones are passing away. Some should not have passed away according to their age or their ministry, but they did pass away. This is probably because spiritual giants are a hindrance to producing the church ministry. Some so-called spiritual giants are not as prevailing as they used to be. Even among the co-workers now, there is always the sense of loneliness. Although the term coordination is not there, there is a cry for the reality of coordination.</p><p>Today the saints' heart toward service is very different. The situation today is like the spring blossoms after the early rain. Among the churches many people are seeking after the Lord. In the hospitals and on the campuses, many young ones are rising up. In Shanghai we see clear signs everywhere that the brothers and sisters have a desire to serve the Lord. On the one hand, we do not see spiritual giants being raised up. On the other hand, we see all the brothers and sisters in all the localities rising up. Even the little members are rising up to serve the Lord. This is the Lord's own work.</p><p>Whether or not we can bring about the service of the Body depends entirely on us. Can we submit ourselves to the authority of those ahead of us? If we can submit to authority, we can be others' authority. What is needed today is men who can lead others into the services, not men who will replace others in their services. We have to perfect others to the extent that they can rise up and serve. It is not the way today to have revival meetings, nor to enlist people into services. The way today is for us to learn the lessons first and to dive into the realities first. It is difficult to submit to authority, but it is more difficult to be an authority. Yet only through authority can we bring the brothers and sisters into the services. This requires that we pass through the dealings and breakings ourselves. We cannot give ourselves an easy way out. If we do not give ourselves an easy way, the Lord will have His way among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE LEADING OF THE BODY<br />AND THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 15, 1948, 6:30 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speaker: Watchman Nee</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING LEADING</h2><h2 class="head2">The Leading of the Conscience and<br />the Leading of the Church</h2><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi: What is the relationship between submitting to the authority in the Body and personal submission before God? Is there a difference between individual leadings and leadings in the Body?</p><p>Brother Nee: Catholicism and Protestantism belong to two different systems. In Protestantism everyone is led individually by his own conscience. In Catholicism everything is governed absolutely by the church's leading. The Catholic Church thinks that all of God's leadings come through the church and that a man cannot come to God directly, but must come to Him through the church. The Protestants oppose this. They think that a man should follow God according to his free conscience. Protestantism rejected Catholicism, but in so doing, it brought in Sardis and paved the way for Laodicea. God wants His people to come out of Thyatira. He also wants His people to come out of Sardis.</p><h2 class="head2">Personal Leading Being a Matter<br />of the Sense of the Inner Life</h2><p>In the Bible there are two instances where the matter of God's leading is covered. The first place is the first Epistle of John, which speaks of the leading of the anointing (2:27). The second place is the book of Hebrews, which speaks of the leading in the new covenant (10:10-12). The former emphasizes the knowledge of spiritual senses, whereas the latter emphasizes the knowledge of God's law. The new covenant teaches us to know God's law, whereas the anointing teaches us to know the way to serve God. Only when we live before God do we know His law. We make judgments concerning everything by the responses of the inner life, not by outward regulations. In the same principle we come to know what is of God and what is not of Him by the anointing, not by outward teachings.</p><p>We have to be careful to realize that these leadings concern only our knowledge of God before Him; they do not include all other kinds of leadings. If we are not careful and if we generalize these leadings to mean all kinds of leadings, concluding that all kinds of leadings come directly and independently from God, we will have a problem. First John and Hebrews are on the leading concerning the knowledge of God. As to the leading concerning the Lord's way on earth, we have to look at the book of Acts. The mistake of Catholicism lies in the fact that it not only holds a tight rein on the leading concerning the way of the church, but also takes over the leading of the individual consciences.</p><h2 class="head2">Leading concerning the Way in the Service<br />Being a Corporate Matter</h2><p>The book of Acts is a book on the leading concerning the way in the service. Only this book tells us the way the Holy Spirit led men in their works. This book speaks of the Lord's approving and His disapproving as well. In some places it says that the Holy Spirit said this and that, and in other places it says that Timothy and Titus were assigned to this and that place. In addition, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are also epistles on the work, and they follow the same principle as Acts. From Acts and these Epistles we can see that there is the side of individual leading and there is the side of corporate leading. But the majority of the leadings there are corporate leadings. In Acts 2, when Peter stood up, the other eleven stood up with him. What Peter said became the words of all of them. He told the crowd to be baptized for the washing away of their sins. After his word, no one said anything more. John did not stand up and say, "Peter, save some room for me to speak.'' The failure of Catholicism lies in the fact that it does not give any place to the conscience and does not give any place to the reality of the Holy Spirit; the church becomes the highest monopolizing institution. The recovery of Protestantism is the recovery of the individual. However, because it is a recovery of the individual, anything that has to do with the leading of the way of the church is solved by committees, votes, and resolutions. However, real leading does not come through committees, resolutions, and debates, but in a spontaneous, unorchestrated, yet harmonious way. Where there is the reality of the Spirit, there will be no problem with the leading. The real leading is produced under the oneness of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Acts tells us that when there was need among the churches in Samaria, Jerusalem sent men to help them (Acts 8:14). When the few brothers in the church in Antioch prayed, the Holy Spirit set apart two of them for His work. If it were up to us, we would have much consideration about the way to spread to Europe and the way to work. However, Acts shows us that it is not a matter of consideration, but a matter of the corporate leading.</p><h2 class="head2">Leading Being a Matter in the Body</h2><p>At the time of Paul's conversion, even God's speaking to him was through the church. The Lord spoke to Paul not only directly, but through the members as well. Why did the Lord have to speak to Paul through others? If I have something to say to Brother Yu-zhi, I can say it to him directly; I do not have to convey it through another person. But here was Paul, who was zealous in serving God, who shed others' blood and thought that by so doing he was serving God. One day God cast a great light on him and turned his life around. Why would the Lord not speak to such a person directly? He sent others to speak to him instead. Moreover, He did not send Peter, John, or Philip; He sent Ananias. No one had heard of Ananias before that time or after that time. The Lord sent a seemingly ordinary believer to Paul. This shows us that leading is a matter of the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">God Speaking to the Whole Body</h2><p>John's ministry is on God's house, Peter's ministry is on God's kingdom, and Paul's ministry is on God's church. With Paul we see that he touched something from the first day on&mdash;the oneness of the Lord with His church. The Head is one with the members, and the members are one with each other. Paul learned these two lessons from the beginning. He saw the life of the Body from the first day. This is why he was able to drop his self and accept the commission of the work, and why he was later able to commission others in the work. This shows us that God's speaking is not directed toward individuals, but toward the whole Body.</p><h2 class="head2">The Rejection of the Leading in the Body<br />Being the Rejection of All Leadings</h2><p>We have to ask God to do one thing today: If a person rejects the leading in the Body, he will be deprived of all leadings. The Lord's leading in the work is manifested in the Body. If we pay our attention to our individual ways, we will miss God's leading. Whether it is the work or the services, everything is carried out in the Body. An individual can do something, but what he does is different from what the Body can do. The work of an individual is fragmentary and not related to God's move. The works whose basis is the individual are either empty or unsubstantial. If a man stands on the right ground, he has the right works to do. If he does not stand on the right ground, his works are empty even if he does some works. A man can be very busy, but in God's eyes, he can be very idle. An idle person is not one with nothing to do. An idle person is one whose work does not count in the Lord's eyes. When I have no part in God's work and God does not recognize what I do and when I am only busy doing my own works instead, I am an idle person. A man can be very busy and still miss the Lord and see Him pass him by.</p><h2 class="head2">Taking the Corporate Leading<br />Being Wiser Than Taking Individual Leadings</h2><p>In God's work we have to learn to accept the corporate leadings. I am not saying that there are no longer individual leadings of the Lord, nor am I saying that corporate leadings can never be wrong. It is impossible for corporate leadings to always be right; there are times when they can be wrong. But we can ask ourselves whether we have leadings in our individual works, and whether we have ever made any mistakes in those leadings. It is possible for individual leadings to be wrong, and it is equally possible for corporate leadings to be wrong. But proportionally speaking, the decision of ten men ahead of me is surely better than my own decision. We have to learn to be a receiving vessel before the Lord. We should accept the judgment of the brothers ahead of us and take their judgments as our own judgments. We should take others' judgments and be able to have others take our judgments. If you know that a young one has done something that you know is wrong, and if through the lack of learning the proper lesson, you dare not speak to him, you are allowing him to perpetuate his mistakes. If I want to go to Taiwan today and eight or ten brothers say that I should go to Tsingtao, I should submit to their judgment.</p><p>Sometimes an individual may feel very strongly and convincingly about something, and the feeling may differ from that of the Body. However, though feelings may differ, the spirit must not differ. I am here to do God's will, and you are also here to do God's will. When everyone is here to do God's will, there will not be a difference in our spirit. If you complain or are angry, your spirit is wrong, and your emotions are also wrong. If you say, "Why not ask me to go to other places? Why, of all places, should I go to Tsingtao?'', your spirit is not right. If you say that you are going to be a preacher and your father insists that you apply for a job in the Customs Department, you cannot argue with him or lose your temper by breaking dishes and cups around the house. Although you cannot take his suggestion, you still have to say to him, "Father, I would very much like to take your advice. But I cannot obey you, because there is no way that I can be the same as you are.'' If your spirit is wrong, the result will not be pleasant. Not only does your spirit have to be the same; it has to be right.</p><p>In the church the brothers who are in authority should learn to pray together. The basic principle of service in the church is the one accord. In the Bible there is no such thing as the minority going along with the majority; there is only the one accord. One can gather a few dozen saints to fellowship and pray together. If a group of people fasts and prays together in the church, they will surely speak the same thing. It is all right for a person to have some feelings of his own. But if he does not have the absolute confidence that what he has is of the Lord, it is better for him to submit to others' feelings.</p><h2 class="head2">The Leading in the Body Cutting Short<br />an Individual's Journey</h2><p>There is a strong relationship between a person's spiritual journey and the leading of the Holy Spirit. There is a need for the leading of the Body because an individual's spiritual journey can be shortened with the leading of the Body. If a brother is left to himself, he may stumble for ten years before he can come up with something. But through the Body he may acquire the same thing in one evening. If the brother will take the judgment of the Body, he will save much time. The use of authority in the church is for the purpose of reducing the mistakes and shortening the journeys.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Functioning<br />and Everyone Submitting to Authority</h2><p>The principle of service in the church is that all the one-talented ones have to rise up. But as soon as they rise up, the flesh rises up also. Hence, in order for the church to become the church, all the one-talented ones have to rise up. However, in order to deal with the flesh, there must also be the exercise of authority. Here the only solution is for man to listen and obey. If you think that something is right, you should obey. If you think that something is not right, you should nevertheless obey. Everyone should rise up, and everyone should learn obedience. After a church has its authority established, there is still the need for the one-talented ones to rise up. Without the one-talented ones, there is no church. At the same time, without authority there will be confusion in the church. The problem with the Catholic Church is that the one-talented ones have not risen up. However, most of the people in the church are one-talented ones. Today the church has fallen into desolation because the one-talented ones are buried. If all the one talents are dug out and everyone is submissive, the authority in the church will be able to deal with the flesh.</p><p>There was a brother in Foochow who could be considered the very "incarnation of opinion.'' He was very zealous toward the gospel. It was right that his one talent be put to use, but the church could not let him do whatever he liked. At the same time, the church had to give him the opportunity to serve. At any rate a person must learn to obey. We may not see the result today, but in eight or ten years we will see the result. Having authority alone is empty; having the one-talented ones alone is disorderly. But when the one talents are added to authority, we have the church. Under these circumstances, what could have only been accomplished in ten years can now be accomplished overnight. The brother that I mentioned earlier was later dealt with. He responded by saying that he would quit and would move back to his hometown. I said, "Brother, you cannot do this. You still have to serve. However, you must serve according to the way the church tells you.''</p><p>One's submitting to authority is his inheriting the riches that lie in the authority. If a man truly learns to drop the self, he will have no problem with the matter of submission.</p><h2 class="head2">The Service in the Holy Spirit<br />and God's Light Being Found in the Body</h2><p>The kind of service that is in the Holy Spirit is found only in the Body. In 1 and 2 Timothy and in Acts, we see the matter of the Body. Paul told Titus to remain in Crete (Titus 1:5), and he told Timothy to come to him before winter (2 Tim. 4:21). Paul did not ask them to go and pray; he only told them directly where to go. Today God's move is carried out through the Body. Our service is also under the direction of the Body.</p><p>In the beginning God created a garden, and He went to the garden to look for man (Gen. 3:9). After man sinned, God no longer had a place of rest. Noah's dove was not able to find a resting place over the entire condemned earth (Gen. 8:9). God did not have a place of rest. This is why He later built the tabernacle. The tabernacle is God's resting place. The tabernacle brought in the temple. Later, the temple was judged, and not one stone was found on top of another. Then the church was brought in. Ephesians 2 says that the church is the dwelling place of God. Today God dwells in the church (1 Tim. 3:15). In the Old Testament the light was in the Holy of Holies. There was no lamp or sunlight in the Holy of Holies. Yet there was light because God was there. In the same principle, if you want to receive light today, you have to come to the church. It is a strange thing for a person to be able to come to the church yet not receive any light. If a man is outside the church, he can remain in darkness. But once he comes into the church, he will see light.</p><p>Let me ask the co-workers a question: Do you receive more light when you read the Bible by yourselves or when you meet in the church? Do you understand the Scriptures more by staying in your room or when you speak on the platform? What one person cannot see clearly by himself, he will see clearly when he is with the brothers. You may think that what you have received comes from your own mind. But have you ever given more thought to the matter? All revelations come from the light. Only when there is the light can there be the revelations (Psa. 36:9). Today there is abundant light in the church. This is why we have to see that it is impossible for us to be an individual Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><h2 class="head2">Church Service Being Absolutely<br />under the Sovereignty of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: What is the difference and relationship between the coordination in the Body, the coordination among the co-workers, and the coordination among the brothers and sisters? Is coordination merely a matter of following the ministers, or is there something else?</p><p>Brother Nee: For all the time that the church has been on this earth, God never asks man to direct the church. God never asks a few more advanced ones to direct a church. The services in a local church are the result of the assignment of the Holy Spirit. We may think that the brothers who have good behavior and who have some gifts in addition are the best candidates for services. But actually, things often work out exactly the opposite. Those who appear to be qualified do not have the gifts, and those who do not appear to be qualified have the gifts. Although some do not appear to be qualified, others are saved through them. The ones who appear to be qualified, on the contrary, cannot bring others to salvation. Sometimes, the Lord would do something that leaves one bewildered as to what to make of it.</p><p>We have to realize that today the gifts are not under our control. Moreover, we cannot even ask for the gifts. Everything depends on the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:11). Man is unable to do anything; he can only submit to the works of the Lord. When God wanted Saul of Tarsus, He chose Saul of Tarsus. Today our concept is that Paul is our dear brother. But if you were to ask the people in Jerusalem at that time, everyone would have told you that they were afraid of Saul. Even those in Tarsus were afraid of him. Others never imagined that Saul would be saved. Even Saul himself did not imagine that he would be saved. Today we have to see the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit. Everything is under His sovereignty. Those who do not learn to submit under the Holy Spirit will never do a good work.</p><p>Paul did not receive his authority through his commission. A commission by itself does not give a person authority. Only when the Holy Spirit gives man authority will he have the authority. Paul told the Corinthians that they were his letters of commendation (2 Cor. 3:2). Where there is the gift, there is the ministry. Where there is the ministry, there is the authority. This point cannot be argued. Paul received the gift and became the minister. Therefore, he could exercise authority over others. He did not need any commendation other than this authority.</p><p>We often say, "Lord, You are the Head of the church.'' This is easy to say, but it is not easy to be realized. Every work is initiated by the Lord; only He can raise up the gifts. All that the responsible ones are doing is cooperating with Him. If a man tries to act according to his self-will today, the church should exercise some kind of arrangement. This arrangement is for the purpose of dealing with his flesh. An arrangement should not be considered as the appointment of a gift. Because there is the flesh, there is the need for some arrangement. Such arrangement is for the purpose of frustrating, subduing, and restricting the flesh. All works that originate from self-will cannot come into the church. The revival of the church does not come through man's arrangements, but through the sovereign operation of the Holy Spirit. Without the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit, any commendation, commission, or authorization is useless. The most it will do is to add a few signatures to the letter of recommendation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Serving Being<br />the Greatest Recovery Today</h2><p>We have to see that if the one-talented ones do not rise up to serve, there is no way for the church to go on. The priesthood is a universal priesthood. This is the greatest recovery of this century. Many people think that the matter of service is the work of a few people, but true service involves the whole Body. As long as this matter is not fully recovered, we have to go on speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">The Loss and the Recovery of the Priesthood</h2><h2 class="head3">God Securing the Place of Rest through the Priests</h2><p>The priests serve God. Those who serve God are called priests. They may do many other works, but none of those works can be considered true service. Only one thing is true service, and that is dwelling in the temple. In the Old Testament there was the tabernacle. After the tabernacle there was the temple. Within the temple there was the dwelling of the priests. The book of Psalms speaks of the matter of dwelling in the house of Jehovah seven or eight times. The work of the priests was to go to God on behalf of men and to go to men on behalf of God. In order for God to be among men, to dwell with men, and to find rest among men, He has to have priests. God will find a resting place only when He secures priests.</p><h2 class="head3">God Calling the Israelites to Be<br />a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>The Holy Place and the priesthood were the twofold requirements of God. The work of the priests was to serve God, and the Holy Place was the dwelling place for the priests; it was also the dwelling place of God. Melchisedec was a priest of God. But he was alone, and he could not satisfy God. God wanted a kingdom of priests. This is why He called out a people and brought them through the Red Sea into the wilderness. The purpose was to secure for Himself a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). In God's eyes God's people and the priesthood were one and the same. God desired that the whole nation of Israel be a priesthood. As long as a person was one of His people, he should have been a priest. This is why Moses told Pharaoh, "Let my people go, that they may serve me'' (Exo. 8:1; 9:1). Every one of God's people was there to serve God. As such, every one of them should have been a priest.</p><h2 class="head3">The Israelites Having Failed,<br />the Priesthood Becoming the Special Privilege<br />of the Tribe of Levi</h2><p>The law is God's testimony. What the law gives to man is what man should give to God. The law is God's testimony for Himself. Whatever God says to man, man should say the same thing to God. The law says that the children of Israel should be a kingdom of priests. Yet before the law was passed to the hands of the Israelites, while it was still in the hands of Moses, the Israelites had fallen and worshipped the golden calf. After Moses came down from the mountain, he ordered all the men to kill their own brothers and sisters. The Levites did according to Moses' word and killed over three thousand people. As a result, God chose the tribe of Levi to be priests (Exo. 32:1-28; Deut. 33:8-10). Originally, Israel was to be a kingdom of priests. Now only one out of twelve tribes was to be the priests. From that time on, no one had the right to be priests except the tribe of Levi. In the book of Judges, even when men had money, they could only hire the Levites as priests; they themselves could not be priests. In the Old Testament one king tried to be a priest and was smitten with leprosy (2 Chron. 26:16-20). All who serve according to their own will, will be smitten. Serving God is both a privilege and a right.</p><h2 class="head3">In the New Testament, God Intending<br />the Church to Be the Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>What the Israelites lost has been regained by the church today. God desires that the church be the kingdom of priests. Peter said that we are a holy priesthood and a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). In Revelation the apostle John said that we are all priests (1:6). All the gold and silver are for the temple and the tabernacle; they are not for the golden calf. No one should worship a calf, not even the golden calf. A man has to learn to execute God's judgment and to deal with the golden calf. Only by this dealing will the real service be produced, and only then will the "Levites'' rise up.</p><h2 class="head3">The Church Today<br />Not Having Arrived at God's Goal Yet</h2><p>What the churches are practicing today in all the localities is a big failure. The co-workers do not have the adequate understanding. In the bread-breaking meeting, we can say that everyone opens his mouth and prays. But in the matter of service, we have not seen everyone serving. We do not have every brother and sister becoming a priest. In the meetings the only thing that everyone can do is sing. It is true that the priests sang in the Holy Place, but that was not the only service. Today not everyone is serving. Only when the priests and the people become one entity is there the church. Our service today is only the service of three or five people; it is not the service of the whole Body. We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites. Other than the "Levites,'' no one else is qualified to serve any longer. Yet God's desire is that the whole Body would serve.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way Today Being for the Whole Body to Serve</h2><p>My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan! Not only do you have nothing to boast of; you have to confess your sin instead. Personal godliness does nothing to build up the church; it actually tears down the church. The way of the work, the proper way, is to help every brother and sister do the work himself or herself. It is not a matter of much service or little service. It is a matter of everyone serving. Unless we are all serving together, we are not the church. This is our way today. It has to be the church that is working. It has to be the church that is preaching the gospel. It has to be the church that is saving souls. No matter how well we work, as long as we are replacing others, we are one of the Nicolaitans. With us there is only the ministry; there is no church. Even if we are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if we do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever we do, we are failures.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Taking the Gospel as Our Center</h2><p>The gospel is our occupation. Everything else is done on the side. We have to take the gospel as our center. Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth; the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel. The real preaching of the gospel is done by the whole Body. The preaching of the gospel by three or five cannot be considered the real preaching. We need the whole Body, that is, everyone, to preach the gospel. If the brothers and sisters see that the church is a Body, they will no longer be individualistic. The most blessed and happy thing is to give oneself to the gospel. Only when our money is with God will we be joyful. Many people may have too many material riches with them. This is why they are not happy. If they would lose some of what they have, their joy would increase. This is a great matter. The matter is not whether one's occupation is high or low. The matter concerns what we are here for. Some work in their jobs, while others take care of their families at home. But everyone has to give his all for the gospel.</p><p>I heard what Brother Witness Lee has done in Chefoo. I also heard what he has done in Shanghai. All these works are good. But I would add one thing: In the matter of consecration, everyone must have a part. Everyone has to hand himself over. If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word. By that time, as soon as a person is saved, he will hand himself over and be consecrated.</p><p>Why do we baptize people? What is the meaning of baptism? Baptism means that we come under the name of the Lord. When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he no longer belongs to the world. Rather, he belongs to the Lord. Baptism separates a person from the world. We need the "handing over'' as the make-up lesson only because the baptism of many people was not up to the standard at the beginning.</p><p>In the future, when we preach the gospel, there will be no need to put up big advertisements or propaganda. Men will hear and see the gospel. They will see that everyone is serving. If there are three thousand people, all three thousand will be coordinated together. Everyone will be working, and everyone will be serving, but no one will be murmuring.</p><h2 class="head2">Realizing the Glory and Grace of Serving God</h2><p>Brothers, how should we answer God's call? In the old days men tried to usurp the priesthood. Today the priesthood is in our hands already. Are we going to cast it aside? What the Israelites lost was lost; they could no longer recover it. Are we going to make the service of God something cheap in our hands? For some, service to God is a matter of doing God a favor. But we have to see that for God to allow us to serve Him is His grace and favor on us. When a man does not see the glory of serving the Lord, he calculates everything. But when he sees the glory of serving Him, he will kneel before God to beg for this service. Recently, the newspaper said that China Textile Corporation is issuing new shares. When the stock market is up, everyone wants to buy. As long as they have money, they put it into the market. Do we see the glory of serving God today? Those who see it will surely give their all for it.</p><p>Those who are standing far off do not know God's grace. Those who know God's grace and know themselves do not count the cost... [Note: At this juncture, before the above words were finished, some brothers broke down in tears. Sister Pearl Wang also broke down in tears.]</p><p>Brother Witness Lee's concluding prayer: It is not that we can give You much. It is what You want of us. May You grant us a more absolute, thorough, and serious service. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL<br />AND THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 17, 1948, 3:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING RECEIVING A PERSON<br />FOR THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2><p>Question: Should the receiving of a person for the Lord's table be based on asking him questions, or should it be based on touching his spirit?</p><p>Brother Nee: It is right to ask him questions. But it is not enough simply to listen to his words. When a person opens his mouth, whether he speaks three or five sentences or three or five minutes, you can find out right away where he is. If a person does not open his mouth, you will not touch his spirit. A man can say nice words, rash words, or evil words. No matter what he says, his spirit does not change. Today no one can know another person's spirit, except through his words.</p><p>Once a person opens his mouth, he gives away his spirit. The disciples said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?'' Immediately the Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are'' (Luke 9:54-55). As soon as the disciples opened their mouths, the Lord pointed out the condition of their spirit. We must never just listen to others' words. Instead, we must know their spirit through their words. The receiving of a person for the Lord's table is not simply a matter of asking questions, but a matter of the condition of his spirit.</p><p>If a person requests to be received at the Lord's table, and you feel that his spirit is not right, you should deal with the matter. Whoever has such feelings has the responsibility to deal with the matter. All the dealings should only be directed toward the person concerned. If a person should not be received, we just need to tell him; there is no need to pass this word to another person.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY&mdash;<br />THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between the minister in 2 Corinthians 3 and that in the other places?</p><p>Brother Nee: The minister spoken of in this chapter is different from the ministers we speak of in these days. The minister here is of the New Testament ministry. There is a difference between the nature of the New Testament ministry and the Old Testament ministry. The focus of the New Testament ministry is the beholding of the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face as recorded in 2 Corinthians 3:18.</p><p>Second Corinthians 4 tells us the result of having this ministry and of our relationship with the Lord. This relationship is described in verse 7, which says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels.'' This is a very crucial verse in the New Testament. The reason we have this ministry is because we have the treasure in the earthen vessel. Outwardly we may be an earthen vessel, but inwardly we have the treasure. We are not only giving the treasure to others, but we are giving the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessel to others. The problem is that today men only want to improve their earthen vessel; they do not want to show the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessel. Some people hold on to themselves too much. As a result, the treasure is not able to be shown forth. The principle of the spiritual life is that the treasure is hidden in the earthen vessel. It is not a mending of the earthen vessel, nor an artificial way of improving the natural man. We are not trying to cause the earthen vessel to cease to be an earthen vessel. It does not mean that when a person no longer tries to say anything, hear anything, see anything, and do anything, he becomes spiritual. An earthen vessel is still an earthen vessel. The earthen vessel will never be worth much. If the Lord arranges for you to be a student, simply be a student. If the Lord arranges for you to be a housewife, simply be a housewife. Being a student or a housewife will not cover up the treasure within you. The ministry of the New Testament is a matter of how much treasure the Lord has given you. It is not a matter of how much you have washed the earthen vessel.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Mending or Improving</h2><p>Today men are not natural enough before God; they want to be "improved'' earthen vessels. But it does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, because improvement produces only one result, that of drawing others' attention to oneself. The ministry of Paul was quite extraordinary in its manifestation. Paul himself, however, was quite an ordinary person. Today men do not have a strong ministry, yet they themselves are strong. We need to learn the lessons before God to be smitten and dealt with by Him. What we need today is not outward, human endeavor or any work of improvement. Our problem lies in the fact that we do not know how to differentiate between the outward earthen vessel and the inward treasure.</p><p>Miss Barber was a person who truly waited for the Lord's return. She waited daily and yearly. Hymn #377 is a deep hymn written by her. It shows the kind of person she was. Whenever a person came into her presence, he would sense Christ. She was a person who earnestly waited for the Lord's return. One day I went into her study room and found her wastebasket filled with wastepaper. She told me that she was working on a letter that morning and that she had felt something wrong within and had to throw the letter away before she finished. After this she wrote a second one, only to find that she still did not have the peace, and she had to throw that one away as well. In this way she filled up her wastebasket with wastepaper, and the letter was still not finished. This little incident proves that she was a person who lived in the presence of the Lord.</p><p>Outward godliness cannot help a person become a good Christian. Only the part which the Lord has wrought into us counts, and only that part is worthwhile. It is useless to try to be a Christian in an outward way; a person has to drop all such endeavors. A Christian is one who learns to live in an inward way, not by any outward means. Second Corinthians 4 speaks of the death of Jesus. This death of Jesus is the killing of Jesus (v. 10). This killing is not an outward killing but an inward one.</p><p>We must never lead the brothers and sisters into the wrong way. We must not be like the Catholics, who teach people to imitate the conduct of their "saints.'' To do this is useless as far as helping anyone to know God is concerned. Where there is an imitation, reality will not come. As long as anything artificial remains, nothing out of God can come in. The imitation things must go away before the real things will come. The greatest principle today is the principle of the treasure in the earthen vessel. Never waste time to improve yourself. It is wrong to indulge oneself, but it is equally wrong to improve oneself. God has no intention for us to improve our earthen vessels. His intention is for the treasure to be expressed through the earthen vessel.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Pretending or Imitating</h2><p>Many people do not realize how much they make pretensions and imitations before men. One year during Christmas, Brother T. Austin-Sparks was lying on the lawn playing with his son and dog. That was a most unpretending and beautiful picture. Many people seem to have burned-up earthen vessels; they appear unnatural to others and give others an uneasy feeling. No one can remain in their presence for more than three minutes. Some act in such a way that even their voices change and their speaking becomes different. None of these outward pretensions will accomplish anything.</p><p>The goal of Christ's salvation is to manifest Christ before men. It is to present the Lord within to others. We are not drawing others' attention to the earthen vessel. If we do this, it will only damage ourselves. We are drawing others' attention to the Christ within us. Only He is the treasure. When the Son of Man came, He ate and drank (Matt. 11:19), but the principle some practice today is not to eat or drink. Man always thinks that in order to be spiritual, he has to be somewhat extraordinary or mysterious. A prophet has no honor in his own country (John 4:44) because he is no longer mysterious. Because men knew the Lord's brothers and sisters, they did not respect Him (Matt. 13:54-58).</p><p>However, the real ministry is inward. God can do a deep work in a man, and yet at the same time that person can still be a very approachable person. Evan Hopkins was a leader in the Keswick movement. He specialized in the teaching of sanctification by consecration. He had a talent for drawing rabbits' ears. Often he drew all kinds of rabbits' ears for his children and grandchildren. Humanly speaking, this was not spiritual at all. Yet God used him to spread the teaching of sanctification. God did not send angels to preach the teaching of sanctification; He used an ordinary man to preach such words. In the Gospels, the Lord taught the disciples to turn and become as little children (Matt. 18:3; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17). A child never pretends. We should never pretend to be what we are not. All pretending Christians are those who cry for help in private. They say to themselves, "What a suffering and burden it is to be a Christian!'' Even bystanders feel sorry for them. God does not want us to be this kind of Christian. A Christian is not one who forces himself to behave in a certain kind of way.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Simple and Strong in Spirit</h2><p>Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things. The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is. But human methods always lend themselves to further complications. A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly. When a person does not have anything inside him, but tries to assume something on the outside, he is deceiving himself. Neither a capable mind nor a strong emotion is of any use. The only kind of person who is of use is one with a weighty and strong spirit.</p><p>A man's head occupies one-seventh of the length of his body. If his head took up one-third of his body, he would look ugly. Some people have a good mind, but if their mind is too strong, they look ugly. However, if such a one matches his strong mind with a strong spirit, he will not look ugly. The most outstanding part of a person is his nose. When a man bumps into a wall or a door, the first thing that hits it is his nose. The most outstanding part of our being should be our spirit. We need a large spirit, a strong spirit, a spirit that has been dealt with. If we have this kind of spirit, when others meet us, they will meet our spirit. If others touch only our knowledge or our disposition, we are completely useless.</p><h2 class="head1">COORDINATION AMONG THE CO-WORKERS</h2><h2 class="head2">By the Authority of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: Is the coordination among the co-workers just based on the ministers in the Body, or is it based on some other things?</p><p>Brother Nee: Yes, there are other things. In the coordination there is also the question of arrangement. On the one hand, coordination is based on the Holy Spirit. The Acts of the Apostles can also be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit. The reason it can be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit has the highest authority. The Holy Spirit is like the nerves in the whole body. It is true that the Body is under the direction of the Head. However, the Head rules the Body through the Holy Spirit. Today the practical outworking of authority lies in the Holy Spirit. The Lord is directing His Body through the Holy Spirit. Authority is not a thing; the Lord did not give Peter a bundle of authority and ask him to come back for more when he used up that bundle. Authority is the Lord Himself. The authority that was manifested in Paul, John, and Peter was something given by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit coordinated these men together in different places. Authority is a matter of being one with the Lord. The principle underlying authority is oneness with the Lord. The Scriptures clearly state that the work that went out from Antioch was initiated by the commissioning of the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:2, 4). Only those chosen by the Holy Spirit have the authority.</p><p>The individual work of a worker before the Lord is based on his ministry in the Body. But the overall operation in the Lord's work is based on the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Keeping the Principle of Jerusalem&mdash;<br />Working from the Center to the Circumference</h2><p>Today we need to consider afresh the principle of Jerusalem. God's work began from Jerusalem (Acts 1:4, 8). The word of the Lord was that the gospel should spread from Jerusalem. In the Bible Jerusalem represents God's work. God set up Jerusalem as the center of the work. In God's eyes all the apostles were to remain in Jerusalem (Acts 1:4; 8:1, 14, 25). We will not take back a single word of what we have said in Hankow before. No doubt the church is local. But in God's eyes there are centers in His work. What we spoke of in Hankow was the condition of the local churches when they are matured. The failure of our work in these years is that we pass on the authority to the local churches before they are matured. According to God's order, there is first Jerusalem, and then the local churches. Our failure today lies in the fact that we have the local churches first without having a Jerusalem. The order of the Lord's way is first Jerusalem, then Samaria, and then the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8). Jerusalem came first, then came the local churches. In the past we did not see this. This is why we did not learn coordination even though we had so many small churches, and why the local churches became little kingdoms under the hands of one worker with two or three responsible brothers. The problem with the Lord's testimony in the past is that we did not begin from Jerusalem.</p><p>Today we have to learn first to stand on the position of oneness and begin from Jerusalem. If we do not go back to the principle of Jerusalem, we will not have a proper way to go on.</p><p>Some Bible expositors say that it was wrong for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. They say that the apostles should not have remained in Jerusalem. But in the Bible, we do not see the Lord asking them to leave Jerusalem. It was right for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. When they went out, it was not because of persecution, but because there were those who called on the name of the Lord. Something happened in Samaria. Therefore, Jerusalem sent John and Peter out. After they went out for a little while, they came back to Jerusalem (Acts 8:14, 25). God needs a Jerusalem also in China. The way of the work is that there must first be a Jerusalem. In Jerusalem there were many co-workers, and there was the church. There was much opportunity to learn the lessons. First there was Jerusalem, and then there was Antioch. Even Paul had to go first to Jerusalem to learn the lessons (Acts 9:26-29). It is true that Jerusalem was a church, but it was different from an ordinary local church. In Jerusalem there were apostles and elders (Acts 15:2). But in Philippi there were only elders and deacons (Phil. 1:1). It seems that in Jerusalem the local church and the center of the work were at the same place.</p><p>Today, whether we are driven from our city by outward persecutions or whether some go out because they decide to migrate or spread out, we have to remember that there is the principle of Jerusalem. The Lord's word says that the gospel is to be preached from Jerusalem unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8). This is a continuous principle; it continues until the uttermost part of the earth is reached. If we want a new start, we have to have a Jerusalem. Unless we have a Jerusalem, there is no way to go on in the work.</p><h2 class="head2">Co-workers Coming Together<br />to the Center of the Work</h2><p>Practically speaking, how should we go on? If we are clear about the principle just mentioned, there will be no problem with the practice. If the co-workers will first drop their personal works and come together in Jerusalem, the Lord will have a way. Although Paul was in Antioch, when a problem arose, he brought it back to Jerusalem (Acts 11:25-26; 15:1-2). Antioch can be considered the center of the gospel. As far as evangelistic works are concerned, it is right to have an Antioch. But if we want others to see a model, we have to bring them to a Jerusalem.</p><p>Today there are a few dozen meetings in Fukien province with over thirty co-workers. Because the attendance in every meeting is large, the workers only know that their own place needs men. Everyone wants to work from the uttermost part of the earth to the center. When we had our meetings in Foochow, some came without mosquito nets or even toothbrushes; they thought that they were coming only for a very brief time and were going to go back right away. Their hearts were all in their own places. Presently, over a thousand people have accepted the Lord in Foochow. There are not enough workers. In Jerusalem they needed one hundred twenty workers to take care of three thousand and five thousand (Acts 1:15; 2:41; 4:4). Today we have only twenty workers. These twenty workers are only a fraction of one hundred twenty. How can we meet the need? Today we cannot drop the Lord's basic principle. If we do, the Lord's work will suffer loss.</p><p>The proper way is to first save men in Jerusalem. After these men are sent out, the apostles are sent out after them. Then Antioch is produced. Today the way of consolidation is better than the way of scattering. Jerusalem is not a matter of geography but a matter of principle. When I mentioned this matter in Foochow, the brothers there responded at the beginning by saying, "Let us wait and see.'' But by the time I left, they agreed that this is the right way.</p><p>Antioch cannot come before Jerusalem. We cannot work from outside to inside. Brothers, is not the word of God clear enough? God is waiting before us. We hope that God would give us a blueprint for the work in China. How should the way in China be in the coming days? Should we for now maintain the works in the different inland places or temporarily drop them? We have to catch up with what God is doing wherever it may be. Today we have too few co-workers. During the past years we have lost one whole generation; we do not have anyone to come after us. Presently, I think the first place we have to take care of is Shanghai. I cannot say how many places the Lord has to begin along the coastal provinces, but I do hope that there can be a little beginning along the coast. I hope that some brothers would rise up in Hong Kong. Something must first begin to move in the localities, before the workers will have works to do. We do not know what God will do, whether He will have a beginning in two or three places at the same time, or whether He will start with one place first. At any rate, we need a Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Believer Receiving Spiritual Education</h2><p>In the past we had one great failure concerning our work in the local churches. During the years 1928, 1934, and 1936, we made some advances in our testimony. Yet we missed many opportunities to educate the brothers and sisters. We did not educate our own brothers and sisters well. These brothers and sisters were born into our midst, yet they do not know why we are meeting as we are. To them, everything is more or less the same. This is because we lacked some fundamental arrangements, and we have not provided these ones the proper education.</p><p>The co-workers should know that the edification of new believers is a work that goes on perpetually. Among us, some have been saved for over ten years. Yet they have not confessed their sins once since that time, and they have not made any recompense. Now we have to select thirty to fifty topics, and we should repeat these topics year round. These topics do not need to be improved. Every year we preach the same topics. In this way we will be able to build up a firm foundation.</p><p>Today we need to take care of the whole gospel from its very foundation on. There is a difference between preaching the gospel and teaching the gospel. In the former case, one can change the methods. In the latter case, methods do not have to change. In the matter of preaching the gospel, no two persons have the same kind of footsteps, and no two persons have the same kind of testimonies. But after a person is saved, the teachings they receive should be the same. In the future we will all have to receive the same basic teachings before we move out. All the co-workers have to receive the same kind of training before the Lord.</p><p>The kind of Christian a person is, is based on the kind of education he receives. In the Anglican Church a person is taught only to recite the Lord's Prayer. Such a one does not even know the meaning of "amen.'' I believe we have to spend half a year to a year for our work. If we do not put in this effort now, we will still have to make it up in the future. If we do not do this work now, I am afraid that the future generations will blame us for it. We need to have the same footsteps before we can have the same testimony. Today we are short of standard Christians. By doing this everyone will receive the same teachings. All the brothers and sisters among us must take care of these make-up lessons.</p><p>In putting this into practice, we must be persons who are living, and we must have an adequate measure of life. Otherwise, the topics we cover will become dead teachings. If we practice this in a dead way, what we produce will become another tradition, and it will result in another hindrance that we will have to deal with eventually. If we speak in life, others will receive our speaking in a living way, whether the subject is spoken for the first time or whether it has been spoken for over ten years.</p><p>I hope that the co-workers would be in one accord and would pray for the way of Jerusalem. This matter touches our future and our family. Perhaps we will need some kind of arrangements. There need to be some arrangements concerning who should go where and do what. Perhaps some brothers have been staying in one place for too long; they need to be reassigned. After a person lives in a place for three to five years, he becomes settled and comfortable in that place. It is like a tree having taken root in a place; it is difficult to cut it down after the roots are established.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Replacing but Leading</h2><p>The principle of the work is not to replace others, but to work along with three or five others. If we want to see the work in Shanghai built up, we have to put all the brothers and sisters here into function.</p><h2 class="head2">Humbling Oneself to Give to the Poor</h2><p>In addition the church must pay attention to the matter of caring for the poor. No servant of God can hold back his money. Every item that was in the early churches has to be recovered. If one item is missing, the church will suffer great loss. Caring for the poor was one item of practice in the early churches (Gal. 2:10). If we want to match God's heart, we have to be recovered in this matter. Contacting the poor always enlarges one's heart. We should do everything we can to contact the poor and to help them. A church that is separated from the poor will not be a prospering church. We have to learn to go along with the lowly (Rom. 12:16). We have to learn to humble ourselves, as the Lord humbled Himself (Phil. 2:5-8). Giving to the poor is not performing charity toward them. It is only when a person has learned some lessons, has touched something, and has some kind of wound as a result of this touch that his help to the poor is proper. When I was living in Shanghai, one time I invited a street boy to eat dumplings with me. We must look for opportunities to contact the poor. There are always people around us who are poorer than we are. When the Lord was on earth, He never separated Himself from the poor. Many people are wrong in their dispositions; they have never been trained. We have to learn to "step down,'' to humble ourselves. The more people are saved among us, the more we should give away our money.</p><p>In order to do this, many saints may need to change their jobs. Some who are in business need to change their way of earning money. Some need to change the place they live. Those who are in school have to realize that even their studying has to be related to the gospel. The gospel has to be the center of everything. If it is not, whatever we do will be out of order.</p><p>The Body of Christ demands our whole life. When we listen to a message, we may nod our heads or smile. But when we put the words into practice, it will make us cry and scream. However, we must turn back to God's ordained principles before we can have His blessing.</p><p>We hope that our conference here will end in May, after which some will remain in Shanghai, while others will go to Fukien. Still later others may go to other places. In the end they should still return to Shanghai. Shanghai must be strong. If we can have a proper testimony in one place, the work in the other places will be easy. Otherwise, we will not have a model to show others.</p><p>We can make mistakes. But we do not want to make mistakes. It is not easy to make decisions before God. We really hope that the authority of the Holy Spirit can be manifested among us. In the coming days we hope to look back to find that we did not made a mistake today. The whole work today must be carried out according to the principle of the Body. It must be carried out in coordination, not in a scattered way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH<br />AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THE BODY AND ITS MEMBERS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 17, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE TRUTH</h2><h2 class="head2">Truth Bearing No Relationship<br />with Man's Condition</h2><p>In learning to take care of God's work, one basic lesson is to be absolute for the truth. No truth in the Bible should be entangled with man's condition. Today man is not absolute toward the truth because he entangles the truth with his own condition. When man entangles the truth with his own condition, he feels that he cannot speak the truth if he has not experienced it. Yet we have to realize that it is not our experience which qualifies us to speak concerning a truth. Truth is absolute in itself. David said that all men speak vanity (Psa. 12:2). When he spoke this word, he was not considering himself. Before God, David considered himself as nonexistent. God's servants cannot look inward into themselves. God's truth is absolute; it is not involved with us in any way. Because the truth is absolute, we have to sacrifice ourselves and put ourselves aside.</p><p>Man always sacrifices God's word. Brother Yu and his wife are both here. Suppose there is something that a wife should not do in the church. Can our brother's wife do it simply because she is a responsible brother's wife? The responsible brothers often deal with themselves in one way and deal with others in another way. If we have to ask whether or not a thing should be done, then we have to put the same question to everyone involved in similar cases. A responsible brother cannot say that if such a case involves others, the question should be asked, whereas if such a case involves his own wife, the question can be skipped. We often want God's truth to follow us. We become involved with the truth. As a result, we are drawn into the involvement.</p><p>Last year two brothers came to me and asked if a certain responsible brother had done something wrong. I answered that they considered the matter to be wrong only because they were not the responsible brothers. If they were the responsible brothers, they would not have considered it wrong. This is what I mean by man affecting God's truth.</p><p>We have to realize that the condition of an individual has nothing to do with God's truth. If truth is affected by man, the truth is no longer the truth. If the truth is not something absolute for you, you do not know God, and you do not know God's word.</p><p>In Foochow twenty-seven brothers and sisters came and met with me. Originally, it was only going to be a talk between Brother Lee, Sister Wang, and me. In the end all the others came. I could only present the truth to the brothers there. What I am personally cannot affect what God's truth is. We cannot say that a teaching is right simply because others are good to us, and we cannot consider the same teaching wrong simply because others are not good to us. Once the truth becomes affected by human factors, it is no longer the truth; it becomes something else. If the truth is not absolute in you, you cannot go on. The truth can never be controlled by man. I cannot say that something is right simply because you and I are from the same school or were born in the same place. So many problems in the world and so many disputes in teachings arise because of changes in human factors, not because of a change in the truth itself.</p><h2 class="head2">The Truth Being the Unique Standard</h2><p>What does it mean to say that the truth is absolute? First Timothy speaks of the pillar of the truth (3:15). Why does it say the pillar of the truth? It is because a pillar is something immovable. It cannot go up or down. It is not like a chair that can be moved from one place to another. If we are not sober, the truth will not have any effect on us. The truth cannot be entrusted to a person who walks according to his feelings. This is a great test. A man must stand on the side of the truth to oppose himself. Only by this can he maintain the truth instead of himself. Those who have never been dealt with do not know what the truth is. Some people lower the truth a little when they are wrong, and lift up the truth a little when they are right. This means that they are like elevators. The truth goes up and down with them. Only those who have dealt with themselves are able to maintain the truth. Praise the Lord, He is the "elevator''; and we are going up and down with Him!</p><p>The reason for so much darkness today is that man sacrifices the truth and forces the truth to yield to him. If you can take the truth as the unique standard and if you have the courage to say that since the Lord has done such and such a thing, you admit that you are wrong, new light will come, and a new way will be opened to you. Otherwise, you will end up thinking that you are the only right Christian on earth and that everyone else has to go along with you. Even the truth will have to go along with you. Those who make allowances for themselves are not of much use in the hand of the Lord. A person must be able to say before the Lord, "This is the truth, and I am wrong.'' If you do not sacrifice the light, the light will uplift you. Blessed are those who can go along with the truth. Only those who judge themselves have the hope of going on. Those who cannot go along with the truth, but instead lower the standard of the truth, will forever live in darkness. Light will have no way to shine on them.</p><p>On the one hand, a man cannot preach the truth unless he has the experience. But on the other hand, a person has to know that the truth has nothing to do with him. If a man is brought to a point that he can no longer withstand God's word and he finds God's word condemning him, he will receive the light. This is the basis of revelation; it is the secret to receiving revelation. Throughout history no one who has received God's light sacrificed God's word. If we are not up to the standard of God's word, we have to catch up, and we have to go along with God's word. If we cannot catch up, we can only say that we have sinned. If we do this, the way ahead will be clear, and we will have more and more light. Otherwise, our reading and preaching of the truth will become vain talk and vain preaching. Man's emotions can never affect God's word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Truth Not Being Affected<br />or Changed by Human Factors</h2><p>If a thing is right, we should do it. If it is not right, we should not do it. If we do not do something just because we forgot to inform a certain brother about it, the truth has slipped away because of our failure to inform him. In this case our informing becomes the truth.</p><p>We have to see that God's word is right and we are wrong. Personally, I can have problems with you, but this must not affect the truth. God's work is always sacrificed because of human relationships. The reason the truth is not absolute is that problems have developed in human relationships. We can sacrifice God's truth today, but what will happen to the next generation? What will happen to those a hundred years after us? If we sacrifice the truth, they will not be able to see the truth. In order to be absolute, a man has to pay a great price. But if we are willing to pay the price to drop ourselves, others will receive the blessing.</p><p>If I want to be near this pillar, the way is not for the pillar to move two feet closer to me; the way is for me to move my chair two feet closer to the pillar. I can move, but the pillar cannot move. I can change, but the pillar cannot change. Many people have changed the truth because of human or historical considerations or because of friendship.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP<br />BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Starting Point Being the Body</h2><p>Brother Tang: What is the relationship between the members and the Body? Where does the individual end and the Body begin?</p><p>Brother Nee: It is difficult to answer this question. Where does the individual end and the Body begin? Let me change your starting point a little.</p><p>We have to ask the Lord to give us the mercy to have a make-up lesson today. We have to see that God's children did not receive an individual life, but a corporate life. God sees us as one Body, but we pay attention to individual members. Consider a stalk of wheat. You may say that there are just grains of wheat. Actually, there is only one stalk of wheat. Bread is made out of many grains. We have a corporate life. What you should ask is when does the Body end and the individual begin. When does the individual life emerge out of the Body? You should not ask when does the individual end and the Body begin. One does not put all the members together and form the Body. Rather, it is in the Body that the many members are produced. In the Bible there is no such thing as individuals receiving life; it always speaks of the Body. We pay attention to the members, but God pays attention to the Body.</p><p>Do not think that by saying this, I am bringing you back to Catholicism. In the Catholic Church there is only the catholicity; there is no church. This is because it does not have life. The Body life that we are speaking of does not start from the Catholic Church, but from the corporateness of the Body. Since our salvation was not strong in that it did not originate in the Body, we have to go back to the starting point to make it up for our lesson today.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:12 says that the Body is one and has many members. It speaks first of the Body and then of the members. We proceed from the members to the Body, but this verse speaks of the Body first and then the members. First there is the life of the whole Body. Then we go home and live our individual lives. These two things point out two different stances. A different stance produces a different result. When I stand here, I can see a few stars. But when I step to the other side, I can no longer see them. The place where one stands is very crucial. The stance we need to take today is that of the Body.</p><p>What we have received is the life of the Body. It is only after I go home that I acquire personal inward knowledge. Brother Tang's question points out our problem in this age. We cannot say when the individual stops and the Body begins. When the next generation studies history, they will say that Brother Tang is surely a man of 1948. Today with the individual there is no way to go on. Only with the Body is there the way.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Fellowship in the Body</h2><p>We have to know that the life we have is corporate. Today man thinks that the life he has received is individual, the experience he has is individual, and the conscience within him is individual. But in the future, we will realize what the conscience of the church is. In twenty years this matter will be as common as getting a haircut.</p><p>If a person comes up to any major decision, he has to learn to follow the Body and fellowship with the brothers ahead of him. Do not think that it is a difficult thing to ask others. You have to realize that it is more difficult to be asked of others. No one likes to mind others' business. No one can have so much interest as to take everything concerning others upon himself. This is troublesome, and it is too much responsibility. However, if we want to take the way of the Body, we have to fellowship. What you eat and wear by yourself are things in the realm of Adam; they are personal matters. But if you go beyond the normal limit, I will say, "This is wrong. You have taken all your monthly income to spend on eating. You have indulged yourself in eating. For this reason, I have to say something.'' I have to deal with the matter. This is a matter of the Body. The way a sister dresses may have gone beyond a certain limit. At such times someone can say, "We are not interfering with the way you dress, but this is something that is damaging the Lord's testimony.'' This is not being a busybody.</p><h2 class="head2">The Accepting and Exercise of Authority</h2><p>Some people like to assume headship apart from Christ. These are busybodies. You cannot entrust authority to them. Authority is received from the Head. Only after a person has received such authority can he execute it. Only those who are willing to accept authority can execute authority. The chief of police has received a commission. That is why he can execute his authority. No one is born a chief of police; he has to receive the responsibility before he can execute his authority. We must see the Head first, and we must first realize that He is behind us before we can have the assurance to speak. I have no interest in touching others' affairs. All those who are interested in touching others' affairs, who like to be the head, and who like to express opinions, have to be stopped. If we do not do this, all those who like to make a display of themselves will become the authorities. In the Body it is wrong both to be free and to be autocratic. Those who are spiritual and weighty before the Lord should rise up to speak. It is not because we love to speak that we speak. When we speak, we have to speak in the presence of God. Those who do not like to be involved with others and who do not like to speak because of their natural disposition should be strong to speak. Those who like to touch others' affairs because of their natural disposition should be restricted. What we want is the coordination of the Body, not the coordination of the flesh.</p><p>The feet are not comely. The head is comely. This is why more people wear shoes than hats. The stronger a member is in the Body, the more it can supply others. The weaker a member is, the more it should receive supply from others (1 Cor. 12:22-24).</p><h2 class="head1">REPORT OF THE WORK</h2><p>We need to give a report concerning the work.</p><p>For many days, we have been waiting before the Lord, inquiring of Him as to the way to go on in the work. We think that we first have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces. The apostles remained first in Jerusalem. Later, Philip went to other places to preach the gospel (Acts 8:1, 5). As far as our number is concerned, we do not have enough to meet the need of the places along the coast. The political situation in northern China is very unstable. Hence, we should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time. Presently, we have over thirty co-workers. The number is not large. We should not have other co-workers wait in their localities for too long. To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people. If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai. These are only suggestions. If you think that this is right before the Lord, we can go ahead and try these things out.</p><p>Brother Chang Wu-chen, Chang Chi-jie, the two brother Chows, Hsu Jung-jieh, Weigh Kwang-hsi, Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Kwei Ru-yu, Wang Hsu-ching, Juo Fu-ru, Miao Yun-chun, Mrs. Lin Pu-ji, Mrs. Lee Yin-shin, and Mrs. Weigh Kwang-hsi should go to Fukien to join the first term of training.</p><p>Those co-workers who should remain in Shanghai are Brother David Hsu, Chang Yu-zhi, Chu Chen, Du Chung-chen, Ren Chung-shiang, Witness Lee, Jiang Shui-wu, Sister Ruth Lee, Phoebe Chang, Pearl Wang, Chow Ching-mei.</p><p>For Nanking, there are Brother Chang Yu-lan, Chi Yun-tung, and others.</p><p>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling will return to Tientsin. He should drop his job sooner or later.</p><p>Brother Lan Tsi-yi will return temporarily to Hankow. Later, if he can find others to substitute for him, he can also come to Foochow.</p><p>As far as the nature of the work goes, there is the need to resume the literature work. We still need to publish books and magazines. We hope that there can be the following publications:</p><p>(1) The Present Testimony&mdash;For the more matured ones. The content will be of a deeper nature. We ask Brother Yu to take responsibility for this paper.</p><p>(2) The Christian&mdash;For the new believers. We ask Brother Witness Lee to edit this paper.</p><p>(3) The Glad Tidings&mdash;For the gospel. We ask Brother Stephen Kaung to take more responsibility for this paper.</p><p>(4) Collection of Newsletters and The Open Door&mdash;Dealing with practical problems in the localities. We ask Sister Ruth Lee to be chief editor of these papers.</p><p>There is the need for mass publication of gospel tracts.</p><p>The editing and compilation of the hymnal will be taken care of by Brother Tang, Brother Chow, Brother Lee, and myself.</p><p>The publication and distribution of these papers will be the responsibility of Chang Hsi-nien.</p><p>To all the other brothers and sisters: The money that you have earned in the past, you can keep it for your own use. From now on, all the money that you make, other than what you need for your own expenses, should all be given to the work of the gospel.</p><p>To the sisters who take care of their families: We hope that you will bear a good testimony at home. At the same time, you should serve the Lord properly in the church.</p><p>To the brothers and sisters who are still in school: You should continue to go to school. There is a great possibility that in the future all of you will have to give up everything to preach the gospel. While you are studying, you should prepare yourselves for this. Wherever the church puts you, you should work there. Your future is governed by the gospel.</p><p>Today we present ourselves once again before the Lord. We hope that Brother Tang and Brother Kaung will come out in the near future. By the near future, we mean the very near future. I hope that my words will not be misunderstood.</p><p>Brother Chen Ke-san will first return to Foochow.</p><p>Brother Hsia came out of Tsingtao. The Communists have arrived in Tsingtao. Your coming out is not a running away, but a move under orders. All the other brothers and sisters are left in the Communist-controlled areas. Many want to leave and do not want to stay.</p><p>Brother Witness has come to Shanghai, but his family is still in Nanking. His children are growing up day by day. Mrs. Lee has ways to take care of them. Without the proper care, they may be difficult to manage in the future.</p><p>Today God's work requires that all the brothers and sisters give up everything they have. Individually, we should all try to save as much money as possible. The co-workers have given up their all. The publication of the magazines alone will need so many hundreds of millions in local currency [because of war-related inflation]. The meeting hall in Foochow, the guest halls, and the place for the long-term training in Kuling all need money. We have purchased much land already, but we have not bought everything we need yet.</p><p>The meaning of handing oneself over is that everyone does the same thing and lives the same way. Yesterday, rice cost 5.5 million in local currency per sack. I admit that I was very angry at this. In the co-workers' lodging here in Shanghai, even getting food has become a problem.</p><p>We should never say that money is not needed in the preaching of the gospel. We hope that God will bless us more and will bless the brothers and sisters to have more income. Everyone who has handed himself over has given his heart and body to the gospel. Everyone has his responsibility, and unless all of us give everything we have, we cannot go on.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE BODY IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12<br />AND THE WAY OF THE WORK</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 18, 1948, Lord's Day, 3:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">THE BODY IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12</h2><h2 class="head2">One Body, One Spirit</h2><p>Brother Chi Yung-tung: How do you explain 1 Corinthians 12?</p><p>Brother Nee: First Corinthians 12 is a brilliant portion of the Scriptures that reveals the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Body. We can consider the matter by an illustration. In the Western world men build houses with concrete blocks. These blocks are like the Chinese bricks, except that they are hollow inside. When men build walls, first they fill up these blocks with cement, then put cement outside the blocks to join the blocks together. The life that we received is the Lord's life; it is not the life of our flesh. We become one Body through the one Holy Spirit. What we have received within from the Lord is the Holy Spirit, and the nature of our oneness without is also the Holy Spirit. It is like the concrete blocks which have cement within and without. The nature of what is within is the same as the nature of what is without. We are baptized into one Spirit, and we are given to drink of the same Spirit (v. 13). That which is first put into us is the same as that which is added on to us later. This is why we can become one Body. What we have received from the Lord is the same as what is joining us together. The basis of life is the basis of fellowship. We can say that there is only one Body because all the members are of the same nature. The Body is one because there is only one Holy Spirit. The members issue from the Body, and though there are many members, it is still one Body (v. 12). The origin of the members is the Body. From the one Body the many members are produced. Later, the Holy Spirit joins these many members into one Body again. It is like a wall being composed of many bricks and the many bricks put together becoming one wall. Oneness is not based on having the same heart. It is based on having the same nature. We drink of the Holy Spirit within, and we are baptized into the Holy Spirit without. This is the oneness of the believers. As members we proceed from the Body and consummate in the Body. Looking back, we are one Body, and looking forward, we are also one Body. Because we are one, we can be coordinated together.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of the Holy Spirit<br />Being in the Body</h2><p>Based on this oneness there is the consciousness of the Body. The operation of the Holy Spirit is found in the Body. The Holy Spirit is not simply the power of single individuals, but the power of the Body. The service of the Body should be the manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit. An individual before God is like a one-dimensional plane, whereas the Body before God is like a three-dimensional object. Today the age of individual ministry is over. The gospel has to be preached by the whole church. Everything needs to be dealt with by the whole church. In the past a single individual might have been able to preach the gospel and to have results in his work. But today all these things must be done in the Body. Once we touch the reality of the Body, the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested. Matters often cannot be taken care of by one or two brothers alone. Many people think that the power of the Holy Spirit is for individuals and that a man can take home a bundle of the Holy Spirit's power and use it bit by bit. However, we have to realize that the power of the Holy Spirit is in the Body. Life issues from the Body and returns to the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Standing on the Ground of the Body</h2><p>We think that we are first the members and then become a Body after we are joined together at baptism. Actually, we start out being the Body. If you like to be a member, you are a member. If you do not like to be a member, you are nevertheless a member. If you stand on the ground of an individual, you will miss the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The Body issues from oneness and culminates in oneness. There needs to be a great change in our realization of the truth. If everyone would stand on the ground of the Body, things would become much easier. If a man does not stand on the proper ground, much trouble will result. One piece of a jigsaw puzzle that is out of place will put many other pieces out of place also.</p><p>The more we deal with the flesh individually, the more flesh there will be. In the Body there is no individual life, only the corporate life. Anything that is contrary to the Head and the Body does not belong to this life.</p><h2 class="head2">The Riches in the Body</h2><p>Many riches are in the Body. The Body is full of light. Where there is the Body, light spontaneously comes. The Body is the place where light is deposited. In the Body we have the greatest light. God's light is found in the Body. How much individual guidance can one have? If you are not the eyes, how are you going to see? The Body is also full of supply. What one cannot obtain individually, he obtains in the Body. If you only existed as an individual member, it would only be a matter of whether or not you were individually useful. But if you are in the Body, whatever function you do not have, others will make up for it. Their function will become your function. The hands can touch, and the feet can walk. This causes the members of the Body to build each other up.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">Love Being Expressed Only in the Body</h2><p>Brother Chow asked concerning love in the Body.</p><p>Brother Nee: It is difficult for an individual to love by himself. Love is in the Body. Ephesians 4 speaks of the "building up of itself in love'' (v. 16). Only when one is in the Body does he know what love is. Philadelphia is manifested in love, not in doctrines. Ephesians 5 speaks of the love in the Body. Verse 29 says, "No one ever hated his own flesh.'' First Corinthians 12:26 says, "Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.'' One only sees a person hurting others' bodies. One seldom sees anyone hurting his own body. When we have the love in the Body, we can speak the truth one to another. With some people, you cannot rebuke them apart from the Body. But when you are in love, you can rebuke them. With some people, you cannot say an honest word apart from the Body. But in the love of the Body, you can say an honest word to them. Love can only be manifested in the Body. Only in the Body is there genuine love.</p><h2 class="head2">Loving in the Body</h2><p>It is difficult to put many things in the Bible into practice unless these things are placed in the right position. When they are in the right position, they can be accomplished easily. It is difficult for one to love individually. But in the Body it is easy to love. For example, the Bible says that we are all priests, and that the office of the priesthood is universal. But if you say to a nominal member in a denomination, "You are a priest,'' and he takes your word and goes to the pastor the following week during the Holy Communion and says to the pastor, "We are all priests; either of us can conduct the ceremony,'' you will find that there will be immediate trouble. What we have spoken cannot be realized in certain places. Some speak of guidance but ignore the Body. Immediately, there is confusion. Guidance is in the Body. Love is also in the Body. When a person is not in the Body, he cannot see the right result.</p><p>Many words which are difficult to say to individuals can be spoken in the Body. This is because with the Body we have the right position. For over twenty years I have not dared to speak concerning money. But today I dare to speak about money. This is because I am in the Body. If a brother has need today, I can take off my hat and ask you for money. If the same thing happened before and we were standing on a different ground, it would have been unthinkable for me to do it. Today, since we are in the Body, if I do not ask you for money, who do I ask for money? In the Body asking others is just like asking oneself.</p><p>This is what we mean by the Body. Only in this Body is there love and authority, and only here can we deal with the flesh. If we are in the Body, not a single word will irritate us or cause us to stumble.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF THE CHURCH AND THE WAY OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking the Jerusalem Line&mdash;<br />the Church and the Work Being One</h2><p>Brother Witness Lee: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?</p><p>Brother Nee: We covered the way among us in 1937. At that time we spoke of the difference between the local churches and the work. Our line then began from Acts 13. But during the past few years, we found our problems. We found that we have to begin from chapter one. The Acts of the Apostles begins with chapter one. It is wrong for us to pay attention to the difference between the church and the work before the church is ever built up. We should start from the basis of the church and the work being one. Our mistake lies in the order and the sequence; it is not a mistake in the truth itself. We were not wrong in the truth, but we were wrong in the timing. Our work must first return to the principle of Jerusalem. The starting point of the church is the work.</p><p>Before the Lord there is first the church and then the giving of the gifts of the apostles and prophets and so forth. In Ephesians 4 the Holy Spirit and Paul did not even acknowledge the existence of the twelve apostles. The order there is first the ascending on high of the Lord, then the giving of the gifts. These gifts are given after the church has been produced. The prophets there do not include such prophets as Elijah, nor do they include such people as Peter before the Lord's death. Peter was an apostle in two different ministries. One was before the formation of the church, and the other was after the formation of the church. The Peter in the Gospels is the Peter before the formation of the church, and the Peter in Acts 2 is the Peter after the formation of the church. This is why we say that in Ephesians 4 there is first the church and then the work.</p><p>Before God, there is first the church and then the work. But on earth, there was first the work and then the church. There were the apostles in Jerusalem first, then the church in Jerusalem. Afterward, there were deacons and elders. In the church in Jerusalem there were first the deacons and then the elders. Many people become a deacon first and an elder afterward. Some need to serve first in the matter of food before they can take care of the administration. The situation in Jerusalem is different from that of an ordinary church. There we have the elders, deacons, and apostles as well.</p><h2 class="head2">Consolidating the Work and Spreading the Fruit</h2><p>Please remember that Peter carried out his work in Jerusalem. Only Philip was sent to Samaria. Under normal circumstances, we should send all the Philips out. Today the co-workers should come together and work in one place, whereas the brothers and sisters should be sent out. The believers in Jerusalem should go out everywhere for the gospel. If we do not migrate today, persecutions may come and force us out.</p><p>During the past years small meetings have been raised up in many localities. These are not the works of the workers, but the works of the brothers and sisters. These brothers and sisters moved to these localities for the sake of their jobs. Presently, small meetings have started everywhere, and we have to go back and deal with every one of them. Our problem lies in the fact that we did not pay attention to the sending out of the workers from the beginning. This is why many local churches developed problems. It is true that the apostles should remain and work in Jerusalem, but their view should be enlarged to include other places.</p><p>The church in Antioch is of a different principle. Antioch is the case of the church producing the work, whereas Jerusalem is the case of the work producing the church. Today we should first come back to take the way of Jerusalem. Later, we hope that some local churches can practice the principle of Antioch. First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body on earth. It deals with the question of the church on earth. That is why it says that the apostles and the prophets produce the church.</p><p>Today we need both principles. On the one hand, the church produces the apostles. On the other hand, the apostles produce the church. If our work can progress along these two lines simultaneously, we will see great blessings ahead of us. On the one hand, we should consolidate the work. On the other hand, as soon as people are saved, we should tell them that they live for the gospel. We should not wait until persecution arises. We should send them out immediately. This is the Lord's way.</p><h2 class="head1">REPORT OF THE WORK</h2><p>The following is a report on the work:</p><h2 class="head2">The Building of the Big Meeting Hall</h2><p>How should Shanghai go on? What kind of way should the church in Shanghai take? The foremost question is the building of the meeting hall. Either we do not build anything at all, or we have to build a big hall. Before the Lord, what we see is not just what we have right now. The brothers and sisters should have some foresight. Other than the big meeting hall, there is the need to divide the work into five districts: Chia-Bei, Yang-She-Pu, southern French Concession, Fu-She Road, and Inner-city. Shanghai has a population of 4.2 million; there are many things that need to be taken care of. Foochow has only 320,000 people. Recently, a thousand people were added to Foochow, and there was no way that we could take care of them all.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Begetting and Nourishing</h2><p>More important than business responsibilities, there are spiritual responsibilities. These are works such as bringing friends to the gospel meetings, visiting new believers, and so forth. You should take care of the friends and relatives that you bring to the meetings. When the new ones stand up in the meetings to answer the call, the speaker will not necessarily notice them, but you will. The speaker on the platform can be deceived through oversight, but you will not be deceived easily. If every brother and sister will bring their own friends, men will not be saved in a loose way. You can be very sure that certain ones are saved or not saved, and it will not be easy for false believers, or false brothers, to slip in.</p><p>After a person is saved, the more matured ones should take up the responsibility to care for him. Sometimes it takes five to ten persons to take care of one. You have to help such a one to read the Bible and to pray. You have to follow up with him and check if he has consecrated himself. If you do not do your job, the brothers have to rise up to reproach you. You have to see whether the new ones are coming to the meetings and what their family backgrounds are. If a brother cannot come for any reason, you have to go to him to make up the lessons for him. Brother Cheng, if you are the one responsible for the make-up lessons, and others do not come to the meetings, you cannot sit there and rest. Concerning the matter of preaching the gospel and the visitation of the new believers, I hope that every brother and sister will participate in the work.</p><h2 class="head2">Caring for the Poor</h2><p>Another more basic work is caring for the poor among us. No matter how high a position a person occupies or how reputable his name is, he has to learn to go along with the lowly. We should gather together all our used items, such as old clothing, old socks, and so forth, and invite those who cannot make a living otherwise to come and mend, wash, and iron this clothing, and we should preach the gospel to these people. Whether or not they will believe, we will still ask them to come to work. If we do not do this, our heart will be too narrow. By doing this our hearts will be enlarged. Many brothers and sisters do not have any patience with the poor. By doing this our hearts will be enlarged. If we do this, one day we may not be able to find any used items in the church any longer; all the old things will have been given away. The early churches always cared for the poor (Gal. 2:10). It is wrong for a church to preach spiritual teachings only. Among us, every one of us has to deal with unbelievers, every one has to deal with new believers, and every one has to deal with poor people.</p><h2 class="head2">The New Believers' Meeting</h2><p>Another matter we have to take care of is the edification of the new believers. We have been Christians for over thirty years. The more we go on, the more we are clear about the things that a Christian should have. There are many basic truths that every Christian should know, such as rising up early, reading the Bible, praying, consecrating, dealing with one's past, dealing with money, meeting, singing hymns, and so forth. There are fifty to sixty items of truth that every Christian should know. We workers have a bad habit. We do not like to repeat any message that we have preached before. We hope that the manna will be different every day. In conducting the basic trainings, not only must we be strict regarding the topics, but we must pay much attention to checking on the practice of the new ones and overseeing them. All the co-workers have to be living persons. If we are not living, we will produce something like the Common Prayer Book, which is dead. In order to make our service truly church service, everyone has to be living, and everyone has to take up some responsibility. The matter of serving the Lord is a Body matter. As such, everyone has to serve. If we exhort others to serve, yet we have no work for them to do, our exhortation becomes impractical. We must give everyone something to do. When the whole church is working, no one will be idle.</p><h2 class="head2">A Model of the Work</h2><p>I hope that the church in Shanghai can be opened up for others to come and personally observe the way the work is conducted here. They can come and see how new ones are brought in and how they are being sent out. I hope that in the future we can see something spiritual established both in Shanghai and in Foochow. We expect to see that after a certain point everyone will be a priest, and everyone will aggressively preach the gospel and care for the new ones.</p><h2 class="head2">Migration</h2><p>The matter of migration depends on how much the brothers and sisters have learned the lessons. If they have learned the lessons properly, they can migrate. Hence, we have to help the new ones to serve both in business affairs and in spiritual affairs. All these must be practiced by the whole Body. We have to know how to deal with the new ones, and we have to know how to send these new ones out. If we do not do this, we will not know how the other churches are doing. But if we do this, we will help the other churches instead of just criticizing them. This is our hope. At the same time we hope that the brothers who are sent out will have the same footsteps and set up a high standard. Those who are willing to join us can join us, and those who are afraid are free to go. It is not enough to be recovered to the churches in the first century in doctrine only. We have to offer up everything we have for God. Unless we are fully brought back to the beginning in our living and our practice, we are not doing any meaningful work. We ourselves must first be brought back. The co-workers must consecrate themselves, and the brothers and sisters must also offer up their careers. This kind of consecration has to be absolute. We have to produce a group of Christians who are different, who glory in offering up everything to God. We have to be such standard Christians.</p><p>How can the brothers and sisters who are in their jobs serve God in an absolute way? In order to do this, the co-workers must first consecrate themselves in an absolute way. Only when the co-workers are absolute in their consecration can such consecration be wrought into the other working brothers and sisters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 19, 1948, 6:30 a.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">THE SOLID CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE CHURCH</h2><p>We believe that many of the critical issues in consecration have to do with God. But there are two conditions to consecration without which our consecration will not be solid. The first factor has to do with the church. Consecration is not simply us handing ourselves over to the Lord, but us handing ourselves over to the church. Surely when a person consecrates himself, he hands himself over to the Lord. But no one knows when this kind of consecration has changed or has been retracted. Only the consecration that is done under the authority of the church is solid, and only this kind of consecration will last. If a man says that he is consecrating himself, yet has not handed himself over to the church, such a consecration is not solid.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THOROUGH CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />INVOLVING MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS</h2><p>The second thing about consecration is that it always touches our money and occupation. A consecration that does not result in handing ourself over to the church is not solid, and a consecration that does not touch our money and occupation is not thorough. These two subjects, money and occupation, require special attention.</p><h2 class="head1">MONEY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Relationship between God,<br />All Things, and Money</h2><p>How does God see money? Here we need to understand two kinds of relationships. The first is the relationship between God and all things. The second is the relationship between all things and money. God made from one all things (Acts 17:26). Everything a person touches with his hands and treads over with his feet is made by God. God not only made from one all things; He is even the Lord of all things. Satan is God's adversary. Yet he cannot deal with God directly. Because he cannot deal with God directly, he deals with all the things that issue from God's creation. Because Satan cannot damage God Himself, he tries to damage God's work. If Satan can snatch God's creation out of His hand, God will have failed. In order to damage God's work, Satan tries to snatch away God's creation.</p><h2 class="head2">God Making from One All Things,<br />whereas Satan Unifying All Things through Money</h2><p>Today I wish to point out to you the relationship between all things and money, and the relationship between all things and God. Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things. "All things'' are too much for him to handle. It is too troublesome to gain all things. "All things'' include cows, goats, wood, stone, and so forth. You could not exhaust the list of all things with a thousand lines. God made from one all things. Hence, Satan reduces all things into one thing. This one thing is money. There is nothing in this world that cannot be bought with money. If a person has money, he has all things. This is why "money" in Chinese is tung-hwo, which means the "common good.'' You cannot call a piece of stone plus a piece of wood, two of anything. You cannot call a chair plus a table, two of anything. But through the invention of money, Satan is able to unify all things. He makes all things simple. Originally, the world with all its myriads of items was made from one. Now Satan is unifying these myriads of things into one through money. Everything that we see today can be reckoned in terms of money. Money is the means to unify all things. All things are created by God. Only money is not created by God; it comes from Caesar. When men asked Christ if there was a need to pay tribute money, He asked them to show Him a denarius, and He answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar'' (Matt. 22:21). He did not take any money out from His own pocket. Had He done this, others would have said that He too had Caesar in His pocket.</p><p>Money is created by Satan for the purpose of unifying all things. All things can be reckoned in terms of money. The earth is created by God. Yet today man can reckon the price of land in terms of money. If it is possible, man would even reckon the price of the moon or the hydrogen in the sun with money. Today man can buy everything. He can buy time. He can even buy human souls. One brother worked in the post office for many years. The post office had bought his soul. Jacob's wealth included cattle and sheep and the souls of men as well. Revelation 18 tells us that the human soul is a commodity that can be bought and sold (vv. 12-13). God has made from one all things. But Satan has unified all things into one.</p><h2 class="head2">Satan Withstanding God through Mammon<br />and Usurping Man's Worship through Mammon</h2><p>When we gain God, we have all things. In the same way, when Satan takes hold of money, he has everything. Money is omnipotent; everything can be bought with money. In order to buy wood, stones, or any other things that we like, we need mammon. As a result, mammon becomes the power, the center, of man's worship. Is man going to worship God or mammon? This is the controversy of the universe. The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things. Mammon is diametrically opposed to God. Mammon can withstand God because it is the only thing that can unify all things. Covetousness is not only a root of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10), it is the same as idolatry. Riches are an idol. The Bible says that covetousness and idolatry are the same kind of sins (Eph. 5:5). If a man has not dealt with his money in a clear way after he is saved, he is not yet fully saved. If a person still keeps wooden or stone idols in his house, will we accept such a one for baptism? Yet many people have never dealt with the matter of money after they are saved. Today we say that India is a nation of idols and that there are more idols than people in that land. Yet there are countless more people who worship mammon than people who worship idols. From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon. Mammon is the most common object of worship.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from Mammon to Serve God</h2><p>God wants to gain us, and mammon also wants to gain us. Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians. If a man tries to hold on to both sides, he will not be able to serve the Lord well. Why did the Lord put such a harsh requirement upon the young ruler and ask him to sell all he had? That young man was quite good and had kept all the laws. But the Lord said that he lacked one thing, the most important thing, which had to do with mammon (Luke 18:18-23). The same principle applies when Zaccheus gave half of his possessions to the poor when he repented (19:8). The same principle can also be seen in Acts 4 where the disciples sold their land and possessions, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own (v. 32). By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack'' (2 Cor. 8:15).</p><h2 class="head2">Overcoming Mammon<br />to Have Spiritual Power</h2><p>In church history the Moravian church was the group that had the strongest mission. Its founder, Count Zinzendorf, gave up all his possessions for the Lord. Sister Eva also gave up all that she had. A few decades ago, seven Englishmen came to China to preach the gospel. They were known as the Cambridge Seven. Among them was C. T. Studd, who was a cricket champion. He had received an inheritance of two hundred fifty thousand pounds, which equals 1.2 million U.S. dollars, and he gave it all away. When he told the British Consulate that he was going to China, the Consulate General was shocked by his consecration and dared not accept his application. After a week Mr. Studd was still firm concerning his decision. God could use Mr. Studd in a great way because he had overcome mammon. Mammon stands in opposition to God. For this reason, every child of God has to overcome the power of mammon. If anyone does not overcome its power, he will have no spiritual power. The power of mammon does not lie in how much mammon a person possesses. Its power on the poor may be stronger than its power on the rich.</p><h2 class="head2">Working Only to Sustain Our Living,<br />Not to Make Money</h2><p>For this reason, no Christian should try to make money. Men think that it is wrong to make money by unrighteous means and that it is right to make money by righteous means. But mammon itself is unrighteous. Just as God Himself is righteous, mammon itself is unrighteous. Luke 16 speaks of making friends with the "mammon of unrighteousness'' (v. 9). Money is intrinsically unrighteous. Its nature is contrary to God. We have to be clear about the position money occupies. If we are not clear, it will be difficult for us to go on as a Christian. Christians cannot try to make money from the worldly people. If we do, we lose our Christian standing. We say that our Father is over and above everything and that we are His sons. Yet if we would try to make money from the rickshaw coolies, whether it is ten thousand or twenty thousand dollars, it would be a shame to us. There are only two kinds of people on this earth, the unbelievers and the brothers. We cannot make money from the unbelievers. What then about making money from the brothers? Would we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers? Hence, no one can neglect dealing with money properly. A Christian cannot make money; he can only work to sustain his living.</p><h2 class="head1">OCCUPATIONS</h2><h2 class="head2">God Having Ordained That Man<br />Take Up Occupations That Involve Manual Labor</h2><p>The second question is occupations. What are the occupations that God wants? God's will for man is that he has to eat bread in the sweat of his face (Gen. 3:19). In the Old Testament God ordained that Adam had to till the ground and that Abel had to tend to the flock. Men like Abraham and Jacob were all herdsmen. Genesis 4 speaks of the "artificer in brass and iron'' (v. 22). All these are manual labor. In the New Testament the apostles were fishermen, and Paul was a tentmaker. These are also occupations that involve manual labor.</p><p>Paul said that to the one who works, his wages are accounted according to what is due (Rom. 4:4). Occupations that are based on one's labor are proper occupations, for they have no element of money-making. Such kinds of occupations increase and add to the value of the goods. You cannot consider these kinds of occupations as making money; they are merely a selling of our labor. There are only a finite number of things in the world. Suppose there were only ten thousand cattle in the world, and through my farming there are now eleven thousand; my labor has caused the world to have one thousand more cattle. Suppose there was only one stalk of wheat, and through my farming there are now thirty stalks or one hundred stalks. This is to cause an increase in value. Why do I gain some money? It is because I have caused the world to have ninety-nine stalks more. Paul brought the material home, sewed it into a tent in the night, and sold it the next morning. The money he made came from the work of sewing. However, if you buy five rolls of fabric, store it away until the price for the fabric is high, and then sell it, you have made your money without increasing the value of the fabric by one bit. We cannot engage ourselves in this kind of business. All the occupations that do not increase the value of the goods must be changed. We have to have a turn in our mentality. The mentality of many people is focused on money, not on value.</p><h2 class="head2">Rejecting Occupations That Do Not Increase<br />the Value of Goods</h2><p>We cannot engage ourselves in occupations that do not increase the value of goods. The occupations that are right are those that earn wages through manual labor. Those occupations that do not increase the value of goods make a poor testimony before God and even before Satan. In addition, they corrupt a person's heart.</p><p>We have two brothers who were business students. Now they no longer want to study business. Commerce turns a person's mind immediately to money. Before the Lord we have to be delivered from money. Our occupations must be such that they increase the value of goods or improve the goods. Only those who are undefiled in their occupations can serve God in a useful way. If there is a group of people who are delivered from money and on whom money has no effect, God will have a way through these ones. In Chefoo the brothers with lowly jobs were sent out first. These brothers were all engaged in occupations that increased the value of goods. Some occupations are involved with commerce. Those saints who are involved with these kinds of occupations have to learn to drop them. The assignment of co-workers is an absolute matter today. The assignment of the saints' occupations should also be an absolute matter. The co-workers cannot choose their own place of work. Neither can the brothers and sisters choose their own occupations. Those who have jobs need to be coordinated in the same way as those in the Lord's work need to be coordinated. God can only use clean money. The need today is too great, yet we cannot lower God's standard.</p><h2 class="head2">Occupations Having Much to Do<br />with God's Testimony</h2><p>Brother Chang's occupation is not very good. It has too much to do with government and politics. A job in the post office does not have much to do with politics. Working with the customs department is not very good, because it can involve taking bribes from others. An occupation has much to do with God's testimony. Here is the need for one to pay a great price.</p><h2 class="head2">Offering Up Ourselves<br />and Our Occupations to God</h2><p>Our views have to be enlarged. A man cannot say on the one hand that he is learning to serve God, while holding on to money on the other hand. The Lord has no intention that we serve Him while engaging in some money-making occupation. I hope that we can offer up ourselves and our occupations to God for the accomplishment of His purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">The Long-term, Normal Way&mdash;<br />Providing for Those of One's Own Household<br />and Accepting the Arrangements<br />Made by the Church</h2><p>During the time of revival of a church, there are special measures taken. These special measures are different from the long-term measures. During the time of revival we have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. But for the long run there is the need for the church to make some arrangements. At the time of revival Ananias could not keep back anything for himself. The minute he kept back anything, he was lying and sinning against the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:1-5). But in Paul's Epistles, we are told that a person has to provide for those of his own household and that we have to care for the widows who have no support (1 Tim. 5:8-16). For the long run we do not expect the church to do the same things as it does during the time of revival. During revivals we feel constrained to offer up everything. But during ordinary times we have to take care of our family. Particularly, we have to take care of the children when they are young.</p><p>The long-term way for the church to deal with money is different from the way it takes during the time of revival. During revivals we cannot quench the Holy Spirit. But for the long run the church has to make some arrangements. In the early churches there were arrangements. The brothers and sisters should also make their own arrangements before the Lord; they should save something for their own use, and they should set aside the rest as available funds. In this way, even the jobs of the brothers and sisters become something that is for the gospel. Everyone has to consider and reckon before God. Where there are burdens that individuals cannot take up, other brothers and sisters have to come in to help. The church should not bear all the burdens. For this reason, the saints' relatives should be taken care of first by the saints themselves.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Coordinating Together<br />for the Accomplishment of God's Will</h2><p>Our occupation must be such that we earn our wages through labor and through increasing the value of the goods. Today it is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to have excess. It is not wrong to take in much, but it is wrong to keep the excess. We have to simplify our own living, and we have to save money for others. Only those who have given to others know that indeed it is more blessed to give than to receive.</p><p>The increase in bank deposits is just the increase in zeros; it will not give you joy. Only those who save for God, who labor for God, and who increase the value of goods will have true joy in their hearts. If we will practice this, the whole of China will be won by us. Even the whole of Southeast Asia will be won by us. We can carry out our work under the best arrangements. During the past years there was not much coordination among the co-workers, and there was not much coordination among the brothers and sisters in their occupations. This is why we have not done well in both areas. Today the occupations of the working brothers and sisters have to be coordinated, and the work of the co-workers also has to be coordinated. If the coordination is solid and good, all the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs will become our true co-workers.</p><p>If the Lord comes back soon, we will all see Him. If the Lord delays His coming for another one or two hundred years, those coming after us will watch the way we conducted ourselves today. We believe that the Lord has set a straight path before us. Our conference this time has much to do with God's business, the church's work, and the whole counsel of God. This is not a question of individuals doing business or making money.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY OF THE REVIVAL<br />IN THE CHURCH IN CHEFOO</h2><p>Brother Lee: Since the end of 1942, I saw clearly that unless the problem with money is solved, there is no way for the gospel of God to go out effectively. God's gospel has been preached in China for over a century. However, the gospel cannot spread to the inland regions. For over one hundred years, it has been Western money that has been supporting the gospel work. This money has been spent along the coastal regions. Many people became rich as a result of becoming believers. These brothers and sisters are no longer able to move, for they have been nailed down by money. At the same time, money was not able to go into the inland regions.</p><p>We saw that when money was not released by the brothers and sisters, there was no way for genuine revival to occur. On December 13, 1942, the Lord did a work among us. That afternoon I was preparing to preach a message on life. We had been preaching messages on life for two or three years, but that afternoon my message took a turn. From that day forward, we saw that God's gospel can never be released as long as the problem with money is not settled.</p><p>Today God cannot be released because the gospel cannot be released, and the gospel cannot be released because money cannot be released. I know that in a certain denomination in a certain place, a few rich people put their money together and built a chapel. Yet the men themselves were still collecting debts and exacting high interest on loans. Can God be released under such circumstances? At that time some brothers in Chefoo had been without jobs for over a year. Some sisters had even taken up embroidery work, which required fine labor but did not allow them to earn much money. As a result, not much was received from the offering box. For six months we received nothing from the offering box designated for the co-worker sisters. But on that day there was a great difference in offering; many envelopes were received. The offering was not a result of my preaching. On the twentieth, which was the following Lord's Day, I went up to the platform again. We sang Hymns, #472, and many were moved to tears. They realized that the gospel had not been released because they had been holding back their money. By the next Lord's Day, the twenty-seventh, the Lord's work was even stronger, and we felt that we had to meet every day. Beginning January 1, 1943, which was a holiday, we began to have conferences that lasted from ten o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the afternoon. One brother was sick and could not sleep at night. The Lord touched him and asked him to consecrate himself. He could not resist the Lord, and in the end he yielded everything. In this way about six to seven hundred people all consecrated everything to the Lord. Some consecrated their grant deeds. Others consecrated their stocks and shares. Many consecrated themselves for the work in northwest China. This lasted for three and a half months. We met every day for over one hundred days. One day I said, "Who is willing to go to northwest China for the gospel's sake?'' Almost everyone stood up. Many were willing to move their whole family, including all their wealth, for the gospel's sake. The first group that went were laborers with lowly occupations, farmers, and manual workers. The second group that went had better occupations. Some were nurses, others were doctors or men with capital. The third group that went out were the preachers and the co-workers. When the first group moved out, it shocked the whole city of Chefoo, because the outsiders had reckoned that we would never be able to do this.</p><p>This kind of revival went on for three months, and we got ourselves into big troubles. This does not mean that we purposely tried to get ourselves into trouble. All the brothers and sisters had consecrated everything. What should we do now? The brothers and sisters had emptied out their hearts and had offered up all their belongings. Some came laughing, while others came weeping. But all came with their belongings. For two nights we waited on the Lord until after midnight, and we discussed again and again what we should do. After the bread-breaking meeting on March 14, we told the saints what they should do after they have consecrated themselves. During this period everyone became involved in this revival. Many dared not even touch their clothes when they went home. The minute they touched them, the Lord would ask them to consecrate. If they kept anything back, they would not have any peace. But when they offered up everything, they had peace.</p><p>I realized that it was not right for the church to go into business, because the church was simply the brothers and sisters. Hence, we considered the general condition of the saints and assigned them to various businesses. We closed down some improper businesses. The consecrated lands could not come under the name of the church, and they could not be distributed. Therefore, we put them temporarily under the names of the original owners with the condition that they would sell the land when the church needed the money.</p><p>Nothing of what we did then causes me to have any regret. The only lack was prayer. This gave the Japanese a chance to creep in. We did not see that Satan was doing everything he could to frustrate the work. Because the brothers and sisters had offered up everything, including their time and all their possessions, the church had to make some arrangements. It was also at this time that I fell into trials. I became ill, and I separated myself from the work. As a consequence, I was able to escape the hands of the Japanese. After the past five years, I look back and realize that what we did then was indeed the Lord's way.</p><h2 class="head1">COORDINATION BETWEEN THE WORKING SAINTS<br />AND THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>We have to see today that we are not our own and that our possessions are also not our own. Some people should consecrate themselves for the gospel, whereas others should offer up themselves in their occupations. There is the need for the coordination of both sides. Outwardly, you may be managing your own business, but in reality and spiritually, you are doing everything for the church. I reckoned then that this was the only way to have a thorough coordination. If there is a lack with the co-workers, it is a shame to those who are holding jobs. However, there are some places that have many riches and little work. This is a shame to the co-workers. We have to see what a great force there is when the two sides coordinate together. If we see this principle, we will be free, and we will begin to trust in our brothers in the coordination. If you earn ten thousand dollars and spend it all on yourself, the church does not need to rise up to condemn you; you will condemn yourself. No one will need to say anything to you; you will condemn yourself. If you ask what we should do if some decide to take back their consecration when they hear this kind of word, I would say that we are not afraid of anyone taking back his consecration. If anyone can take back his consecration, let him do it.</p><h2 class="head1">ON BEING THE WISE STEWARDS IN MATERIAL RICHES</h2><p>Brother Nee: When we offer up all our money and then receive it back again from the Lord, the money will be very different. Formerly, we were the masters. Now we become the stewards. If we are a steward, yet waste our master's money, the Lord's illustration says aptly that some will accuse us (Luke 16:1). They will say that we are wasting our master's money. Today we may hold different standards of living, but the principle remains the same: We have to do our best to be frugal.</p><p>Once the problem of money is settled, we will become a broad person. Today everyone's mind is different. This is why the same word conveys different connotations in different people's minds. If I say that I will treat you with a meal, the northerners think that they will have wheat rolls, the southerners think that they will have rice, the westerners think that they will have bread, while the poor people think that they will have corn. In the same way, when we speak of the need of the church, different people have different thoughts and reactions. When some hear about the need of the church, they say that it is all right to buy less land and build smaller buildings; they think that there is no need to be very serious about the matter. A person who is not serious does not do things in a serious way. However, we cannot consider matters from our point of view. We have to consider matters from God's point of view. Once the problem of mammon is settled, we will be enlarged. A man cannot serve two masters. Either he serves the Lord, or he serves mammon. The reason we are in darkness and are not in the light is that there is the entanglement of money. If we can solve this problem, many other problems will be solved.</p><p>The gospel has been "bottled up'' like water in a bottle, and money is like the cork of the bottle. If money does not go away, water will not come. If you do not give away your money, you will not even be able to live a proper human life. A person has to open his eyelids before he can see. In the same way, if money does not go away, a person cannot see the Lord.</p><p>I know that many brothers here are more well off than brothers in other localities. In other localities some people cannot even send their children to school. We can be in scarcity, but we cannot become small. We cannot become small just through our scarcity. We have to show other brothers that not one thing is our own.</p><p>What should we do as far as our practice is concerned? First, we have to write down a list. Should we consider the matter individually, or should we consider it corporately? Both ways are possible. Many brothers and sisters receive help through others' testimonies, whereas others look to the Lord directly. This is not the time to talk about the left hand not letting the right hand know what it is doing. It is not a question of myself as a person individually; it is a question of myself being a member in the Body. Even if we will lose our reward, it is still worthwhile for us to cause one or two brothers to rise up. Forget about our personal rewards in the future!</p><p>The church does not want to do anything that will eventually come short. We hope that more stewards will be raised up by the Lord. If some of us have made such a decision, they can present their testimonies before the brothers.</p><h2 class="head1">FIRST HANDING OURSELVES OVER<br />AND THEN OUR MONEY</h2><p>What we want is first you, and then yours. I am a priest, and I live for God. We care only for the fact of handing ourselves over, not for argument. We are not here for money; we are here to help others to hand themselves over. If a man does not hand himself over, it is meaningless to receive a few dollars from him; it is better to return the money to him. God would not be pleased with such money. In God's eyes money is not the main problem. A man hands over his money because he has first handed over himself. As a person you are more important than your money. When a person comes, what he has will come along with him. It is difficult to say this kind of thing to all the brothers and sisters in general.</p><p>If you do not want to hand yourselves over, I will not say such words. But if you have handed yourselves over and I have handed myself over, then we can say such words. What we were not able to say among the co-workers for the past twenty years, we can say today. Today we are standing on the same ground, and we are working and serving together. We are all the same, and we are all serving God together.</p><p>We have to look to the Lord to bring all the saints in Shanghai into this practice. Otherwise, our words of the last few days will result only in a few more consecrations. In another five days things will cool down again. This is indeed a serious matter. If we can bring the brothers and sisters into this practice, many tremendous things will follow.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING A SERIOUS PRICE<br />AND COORDINATING TOGETHER</h2><p>During the past years all of us have suffered many dealings, made many sacrifices, borne much hardship, and paid much price. But the Lord is asking us to pay a higher price today. Only by paying a serious price can we obtain serious results. The Lord has no intention that the co-workers be the only ones to go through dealings and that the other brothers and sisters be exempt from dealings. It is difficult for the co-workers to be coordinated together. It is likewise difficult for the working brothers and sisters to be coordinated together. When two or three brothers go into business together, at the beginning they invariably say that they are doing this to glorify the Lord. But in the end the result is often a shame to the Lord. However, if you hand yourselves over today, things will be different. This is not just a combination of capital, but a coordination of persons. One person can bring forth results a thousandfold, and two persons can bring forth results ten thousandfold. If the brothers will be faithful to the Lord in their jobs and if they are coordinated together, there will be the blessings. With such a purpose, center, ground, and goal, we can bring in the Lord's blessing. When there is any hardship, we try to solve it in coordination. When the co-workers are not coordinated, they can do their own isolated works. But when they are coordinated together, there is no more room for individual freedom. The same principle applies to the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs.</p><p>Personally, I am most reluctant to do such things. But looking ahead, the Lord has His works. Therefore, we have to take this inconvenience upon us and have such a beginning. The co-workers and the responsible brothers should not try to avoid such an inconvenience. When we are doing our isolated works, we can be very comfortable. But in order for the Lord to have a way, we must be coordinated together. In the coordination, we have to accept all the inconveniences. If we do not do this, it will be difficult for the Lord to have a way among us.</p><p>During the past four evenings, my words have been coming out like water gushing from an open tap. Once the tap is opened, there is no more thought of closing it again. We do not know how far this water will carry us. It is not an easy thing for me to speak about these four topics. To speak about them is more difficult than to speak about forty other topics.</p><p>In 1942 we prayed much for the Lord to have a way among us. I do not know how much we prayed. However, although we prayed very much, every time we felt that something was blocking. Because of that something, we did not get through. Now we have broken through the small circle. We will see if we can break through the larger circle.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH<br />AND THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Church Conference)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 19, 1948, Friday, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>Brother Witness Lee: First I would like to explain the nature of this meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to share with the majority of the brothers and sisters the things that we, the co-workers, have been discussing for the last few days. I will first begin with a question: From the Bible and from church history, what is the way for us to serve in the church?</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee: We have to ask first of all if the church has taken a different stand with respect to its service to the Lord. Is the church different today in its stand toward service? Here we have two absolutely contradictory views. Many people do not realize that the church is in desolation on the one hand and is advancing on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">Beginning from the Time of the Apostles</h2><p>The way that the church has taken for the past two thousand years has become progressively poorer. In God's view the church is fully in desolation. We see many sins and errors existing in the church today. From the Bible we see that even the early churches were already in desolation. During Paul's time there were already false shepherds, false prophets, and false apostles. The condition at Ephesus seemed to be better. Yet in reality it was also in desolation. In Philippians Paul said that all were seeking after their own things and no one was seeking after the things of Jesus Christ (2:21). Second Timothy was written by Paul right before he died. There we see also the condition of the desolation of the church. First Timothy speaks of the elders and the deacons (3:2, 8). But in 2 Timothy Paul could only entrust the testimony to the faithful ones (2:2). It was as if he was saying that even the elders and the deacons had become untrustworthy. In 1 Timothy he spoke concerning how the elders had to be faithful. But in 2 Timothy he could only concede that there were wooden and earthen vessels in the great house (2:20).</p><p>Second Peter tells us that at Peter's time some had betrayed the Lord and denied Him (2:1). By the Middle Ages the church had become degraded. It was not carried into Babylon at the fourth century; it had already fallen into desolation at the time of the apostles. This is why judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17).</p><p>John's Epistles were written thirty years after Paul's Epistles. In John's Epistles we see that some had even denied Jesus as the Christ. They did not acknowledge that Christ had come in the flesh. These were those who had come as the antichrists (1 John 2:22; 4:3). Furthermore, the book of Revelation, written between A.D. 90 and A.D. 95, speaks of seven churches. Other than two that did not receive a rebuke, the remaining five received severe rebukes (Rev. 2&mdash;3). All the way from the degradation of Ephesus to the Lord's vomiting of Laodicea out of His mouth, there was a continuation of degradation. The lampstand at Ephesus was removed, and Laodicea was vomited out of the Lord's mouth. Although there were some recoveries in between, it was a situation of desolation for the most part. The book of Jude has only one chapter. It tells of some who had crept into the church unnoticed (v. 4).</p><p>Historically speaking, the situation of desolation continued. From the second century forward, the Roman Catholic Church was formed in a general way. During the second to the third century, the practice of the local church was abolished. By the fourth century, at the time of Constantine, the formal church was established.</p><p>In the early churches once a man believed in the Lord, he immediately dropped the world. The believers did not work for money, but for the sake of the church. The saints had all things in common. The brothers and sisters continued steadfastly in meeting and in the apostles' teachings (Acts 2:42-46). Because those who believed risked everything to believe, many were afraid to believe. Acts says that three thousand and then five thousand were added into the church. But it is possible that a few times more than three thousand and five thousand people had not dared to believe. Many people would say that to go in this way would cost them their name and position. Pentecost not only brought in people; it also kept people away. Pentecost is something that cannot be touched. Once a man touches it, it ruins his life.</p><h2 class="head2">Desolation Continuing until Now</h2><p>The condition at the beginning was very different from what it is today. We cannot live on earth as if the church has never been degraded. We cannot offer up sacrifices like Cain did. The principle of Cain is to live as if a fall had never existed, when in reality there was a fall. Before Cain, there was Adam. God commanded that Adam had to eat bread in the sweat of his face. This was Adam's curse. Cain's mistake did not lie in the fact that he tilled the land and was punished. His mistake lay in the fact that he did not condemn Adam's fall. He went out to till the land without any sense of remorse. When a man sins and does not have the realization that he is sinning, he has fallen into the principle of Cain. Some are obviously in sin. Yet they feel like they have never sinned. Abel tended the flock, and God accepted his sacrifice. God accepted it because Abel acknowledged the existence of the fall. He realized the value of the shedding of the blood. Cain was different; he acted as if nothing had happened, as if there was no need for judgment. Hence, while we live on this earth today, we cannot live without a sense of desolation. Why do we leave the denominations outwardly and separate ourselves from others? It is because the church has fallen. There are so many sects today, and so many people are nominal Christians. Under such degraded conditions, we cannot be dull in our feelings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>However, from another angle we may say that the church has been advancing for the last two thousand years. Outwardly speaking, the church is in desolation. Yet among the faithful lovers of the Lord, God's recovery works have become deeper and deeper, and more and more numerous as time goes on.</p><p>While I was in Foochow, I told some sisters that the history of the church is like our own personal history. Please tell me, as far as our own history is concerned, when are we the richest? The minute we are saved, we are justified, sanctified, and regenerated. We have Christ living within us, and we have the Holy Spirit as our power. All these things are obtained as soon as we believed. Although we may not realize that we obtained these things, they are all there within us. When does a Christian become poor? It happens when he gradually drops all these riches. This is why a person falls into darkness and trials soon after he is saved; he loses all these things. After some days the Lord's mercy causes such a one to regain some of what he has lost. Still later trials come, and he becomes fallen again. The Lord's mercy comes upon him once more, and he is revived and recovers all the lost riches again. Every time we regain something, it becomes more solid in us than before. Eventually, all of these things will become part of us. During his lifetime Jacob rose many times and fell many times. But at the end of his life, he could worship God leaning on the top of his staff (Heb. 11:21). He regained all that he had lost. He was able to come back to God like one who is fully saved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Age of the Fathers until the Time<br />of Luther's Reformation</h2><p>The same is true with the history of the church. The revelation in Ephesians reached the highest point. But this does not necessarily mean that the experience of the church in Ephesus was the richest. The church in Ephesus was like a new believer. During the advance of the church, truths such as justification by faith, sanctification, the oneness of the church, preaching the gospel, and the truth concerning the cross have become clearer and clearer. Whatever has been recovered at a later stage is clearer than that which was present at the beginning. From the letters that the church father Clement wrote to the church in Corinth, we can see that those men were less clear than we are concerning the gospel. Even Augustine's Confessions and Thomas &#224; Kempis's On the Imitation of Christ do not contain as much truth as we have seen today. Among their revelations, there are treasures, but there is also sand.</p><p>We have to see that the church stands in between these two contradictions today. Outwardly speaking, the church is becoming worse and worse. Inwardly speaking, its nature has become better and better. In his books J. N. Darby described the church as a house in ruins. Yet many do not realize that the church is a house of revival at the same time. No one after Paul was able to match Paul's revelations. He saw the truths in a very clear way. Unfortunately, he is gone today. If he were still alive, we could ask him how he feels about today. On the one hand, the outward church has become more and more fallen and degraded. But on the other hand, the inward nature of the church has become better and better.</p><p>Once a truth has been recovered, it can never be lost again. The truth of justification by faith was recovered in the midst of fiery trials. It can never be lost today. Let me ask you if the church could ever lose the truth of justification by faith, even after another thousand years. The books of Romans and Galatians speak about justification by faith. But during the two thousand years of church history, one thousand years saw this truth lost. However, once this truth was recovered, it will never be lost again. The book of Galatians was with the church for fourteen hundred years before Martin Luther, but the truth of justification by faith was lost. Today, through the recovery of Luther, the truth of justification by faith can never be lost again. Formerly, men argued in doctrine about justification by faith. Because many have shed their blood or been burned to death for this truth, it can never be lost again. What the church has inherited today can never be shaken. All the truth becomes more and more solid as time goes by.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reformation until Now</h2><p>After the recovery already mentioned, God raised up another group of people, men like J. N. Darby and so forth. They saw something concerning the heavenly vision, the removal of the flesh, and so forth. There were also men like Pearson Smith, who recovered sanctification by faith. There was Madame Guyon, and there was George Muller, who saw the matter of faith. Then there was Evan Roberts, and in recent times there was T. Austin-Sparks. We can say that there has never been a time when the church was as clear and as rich as it is today.</p><h2 class="head2">The Continuation of the Recovery of the Church</h2><p>There are sixty-six books in the Bible. Of these books, only one has no ending&mdash;the book of Acts. This book only has a beginning; it has no ending. All the other books have a proper conclusion. After Acts 28 there are still many untold stories. John, Peter, Barnabas, and Paul all went to Rome and were judged there. The whereabouts of many other brothers and sisters are not mentioned in Acts. Acts does not have an ending, because we are still continuing the book of Acts. The gospel has not been thoroughly preached, and the Lord has not come back yet. Today we are still writing Acts. Ephesians 2 speaks of the dwelling place of God. Ephesians 4 speaks of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, in order to arrive at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ unto the building up of the Body in love. Ephesians 5 speaks of the church being without spot, wrinkle, blame, and reproach, and being fully glorious. These are conditions that have not been attained yet. We are still in the continuation of the recovery of the church.</p><p>When I was in England, Brother Austin-Sparks asked me what chapter in the Bible is the hardest to fulfill. I told him that the hardest chapter should be Ephesians 4 on the perfecting of the saints. After reading that chapter, I am very concerned that this chapter will not be fulfilled. I am confident about the other chapters. But I do not as yet have the confidence about this chapter. For the past two thousand years, Ephesians 4 has not yet been fulfilled. According to the present condition, I am afraid that given two thousand more years, this chapter will still not be fulfilled. If this is the case, humanly speaking, the Lord will not be able to come back. It is true that the church is in desolation outwardly. But the question today is whether or not there is a group of people who will stand on God's side to receive God's riches, and who will pay the price to appropriate these riches.</p><h2 class="head1">FLEEING DISHONORING THINGS<br />AND TAKING THE WAY OF THE RECOVERY</h2><p>What is our position today? We are standing between two contradicting things today. Outwardly, we should learn to condemn the desolation around us, and we should be separated from it and be delivered from all degradations. For this reason, we have to be clear about the ground of the church. We cannot say that everything is all right; we have to separate the vessels of honor from the vessels of dishonor. The vessels of honor are not born honorable; they become honorable through their separation. The Bible says that if a man cleanses himself from the dishonorable things, he will be a vessel of honor (2 Tim. 2:21). Honor comes through separation. All those who will not separate themselves from dishonor, who are not serious about anything, will be vessels of dishonor. What is it to be a person of dishonor? It is to mingle oneself with vessels of dishonor without realizing that there is anything wrong. This is one aspect of the church.</p><p>At the same time, we have to learn to live in the Body, to be the sons of God, and to take the way of recovery. In God's eyes the church has come up to the full measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ already. This matter was not realized in the past; it was not realized yesterday. But today it is here. What the Lord is doing today is much more than what He has done before. Christians should come up to the standard of God's advanced work in this age. It is not enough to see just the outward desolation. There is the need to advance further to see the Lord's work. We do not know when the Lord will stop His work. We only know that God is preparing the stones. One day, when all the stones are prepared, the temple will be completed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TYPES OF THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>In the Old Testament there are two types: one is the tabernacle, and the other is the temple. Many people can speak on the tabernacle; there are at least one hundred books on this subject. But it is difficult to find a book on the temple. Men pay attention to the type of the tabernacle but neglect the type of the temple. They think that the tabernacle and the temple are more or less the same thing, and that they are repetitive types. Actually, the two types are entirely different. The tabernacle was something temporary and on the periphery. The temple was something eternal and in the center. The tabernacle was in the wilderness, and the temple was built by Solomon. The tabernacle in the wilderness typifies the condition of the church on earth, and the temple in the kingdom typifies the eternal condition of the church before God. If we see this light, we will be very clear concerning today's situation.</p><p>God had obtained a tabernacle in Exodus already. This tabernacle followed the Israelites wherever they went. Later the tabernacle settled in Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). But the children of Israel stumbled and sinned. They had no king among them, and everyone acted according to that which was right in his own eyes (Judg. 21:25). Later, the Philistines came and were the enemies of the Israelites. Then Samuel, Saul, and David were raised up. The two sons of Eli sinned, and the Israelites were defeated before the Philistines. The people tried to use the ark to protect them in battle. The ark was the ark of the testimony, which was also the ark of grace. The Israelites thought that the ark could help them. However, God did not help them, and the ark left the tabernacle. It was captured and moved into the house of Dagon (1 Sam. 4:1&mdash;5:2). God did not try to protect the Israelites for the sake of the ark, nor did He need the Israelites themselves to protect the ark. After the ark left the tabernacle, it never went back to it again. It remained outside the tabernacle until Solomon finished the temple, when it was moved into the temple. Jeremiah 7:12 says that men were still going to Shiloh at the time of Jeremiah. Because the ark left the tabernacle, God left the tabernacle as well. The ark had turned its back on the tabernacle and was facing the temple. This is the condition of the church today.</p><p>At the time of Solomon, the king went to Gibeon to offer up sacrifices. Solomon prayed for wisdom in Gibeon, and his wisdom was unmatched by anyone else. The Bible says that Solomon went up and offered a thousand burnt offerings (1 Kings 3:4). Second Chronicles 1 tells us that there was still the brazen altar, and there were priests at Gibeon (vv. 3-5). But the ark was no longer inside the tabernacle. The ark had turned its back on the tabernacle and had turned toward the temple. This is the testimony of Christ. It is also our way today. Our way is the way of following the ark; it is not toward Gibeon, but toward the temple.</p><p>Today God is preparing all kinds of gold, silver, wood, stones, brass, and iron. When the time comes, Solomon will appear. On that day, no one will hear the sound of any work, because all the materials will have been prepared (1 Kings 6:7). Once Solomon came, the temple was completed. The materials for Solomon's temple were not cut on the spot; they were prepared ahead of time. Although there are noises today, everything will be coordinated in that day, and there will be the temple.</p><p>The desolation of the church is a fact. However, the testimony of the temple throughout the past two thousand years has never stopped. One truth after another has been recovered. These are not small recoveries. Although there are all kinds of noises today, all the materials are being prepared. As a fulfillment of the type of the building of the temple, the church of God is advancing. Presently, the materials are being prepared one by one. At that time there will no longer be any need for last-minute work; all that will be needed will be for the materials to be put together. The temple is not built on the spot. Rather, it is prefabricated. God's work today is the perfecting of the Body of Christ for the arriving at the oneness of the faith (Eph. 4:12-13). This has been God's work throughout the ages. His works today are more numerous and more advanced than His works in the past. The Lord Jesus said that the Father works until this day, and He works also (John 5:17). As time goes on the Lord's work becomes better and better, and the content of it becomes richer and richer. If we take the way of recovery, we will surely see God's work among us.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Sister Pearl Wang prayed: May Your word not be distorted through man. May Your word not be locked up by man. May we not frustrate Your work, and may we not limit Your work. Instead, may Your work have a free way among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">DEALING WITH MAMMON<br />AND SERVING GOD</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 20, 1948, 6:30 a.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">MAKING MONEY BEING UNBECOMING<br />OF A CHRISTIAN'S STANDING</h2><p>Today there are only two ways to serve. Either one serves God, or he serves mammon. Of all the Christians in the whole world, perhaps eighty percent serve mammon. Of the remaining twenty percent, perhaps eighteen percent serve both mammon and God. It is difficult to find a few persons who will serve God only. In the past we never mentioned the matter of mammon. On the one hand, it was because we were not faithful. On the other hand, it was because mammon is a difficult subject to talk about. Mammon itself is unrighteous. A Christian should not only consider it wrong to make money by unrighteous means, but should realize that making money itself is improper. It is not a matter of much money or little money. God's Word says that we cannot serve God even by making money by righteous means. If a person has not settled this matter, he has not settled the most basic issue. God made all things from one, and money unifies all things into one. God created all things, and money can procure all things. Any thought of making money is a sign of serving mammon. Rice costs three million dollars a basket. If we try to make three million dollars to buy the rice, we are serving mammon. Where are we going to make our money? Will we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers? Can we make money from the unbelievers?</p><p>For example, if the president of a country were to make money from a rickshaw coolie, would it not be very unbecoming for him to do such a thing? We are more noble than any president in the world. The worldly presidents are elected, but we are born kings. I wish that we could give away all our things. This is more proper and becoming.</p><p>All proper occupations extract riches from nature itself; they do not extract riches from others' pockets. For example, if there are two billion people on the earth and everyone has a dollar in his pocket, the total wealth of the world would be two billion dollars. If I try to make money, I have to cause the money in my pocket to increase. In order for the money in my pocket to increase, the money in the pockets of others has to decrease. How can a Christian put others' money into his own pocket? Is it becoming for a child of God to do this? Any kind of money-making is a reduction of others' wealth and an increase in one's own wealth. What we have to do is to increase the natural wealth on this earth. Why do we have to increase our own wealth at the expense of others' wealth? How can a Christian do such a shameful thing?</p><h2 class="head1">REJECTING OCCUPATIONS<br />OF A PURELY COMMERCIAL NATURE</h2><p>All the occupations in the Bible derive their riches from nature. The fishermen derive their wealth from the sea. The farmers derive their wealth from the land. These occupations increase one's own wealth without decreasing others' wealth. It is all right for us to increase our own wealth, but not at the expense of others' wealth. The increase of the herd of Abraham and Isaac was a blessing from God (Gen. 24:35; 26:12). But the increase of the herd of Jacob came from Laban (30:37-43). The increase in the herd of Abraham and Isaac was right, but the increase in the herd of Jacob was wrong, because in making the increase, he did injustice to Laban. Today there are many people like Jacob. If this problem is not solved, we cannot serve God in a proper way. As a minimum requirement, we cannot engage ourselves in money-making jobs. We have to reject any work that is purely commercial in its nature.</p><p>Ezekiel 28 speaks of the king of Tyre, who typifies Satan. He fell because of the multitude of his merchandise. Merchandising is a purely commercial activity. Ezekiel 28 is the record of the first commerce, whereas Revelation 18 is the record of the final commerce. Ezekiel 28 is the beginning of world commerce, whereas Revelation 18 is the consummation of world commerce. Revelation 18:11 speaks of "the merchants of the earth.'' "Merchants'' refers to great entrepreneurs. Antichrist will use Babylon to carry out his commercial activities. Pure commerce is not just a matter of money, nor is it a matter of gold or silver. Rather, it is a question of where the money is coming from. Today we have to pay attention to how money comes in. It is all right for me to increase my wealth, but I cannot decrease society's wealth. For example, to turn iron into steel is to contribute something to society, and such kinds of work are proper.</p><p>Today our thoughts have to be controlled by God. Those who are for money see nothing but money. They do not see how many fishes have been added; they only see how many dollars have come in. Pure commerce is too great a temptation for man. This is why we have to make a complete change in many things in the days ahead.</p><p>The Jews were originally farmers, tillers, shepherds, and laborers. But after they became degraded and were scattered into the nations, they became the most numerous and powerful merchants on earth. In the Old Testament God allotted the lands to the Israelites and charged every one of them to work on their own land. The Jews learned the lesson through this, and they did not want to work for others or to have others work for them. They preferred to manage their own business.</p><p>This is a serious hurdle, and one that is difficult to overcome. We have to ask God to turn our thoughts around. It is wrong to make money. Somehow, we have to be delivered from money.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NATURE AND SUBSTANCE<br />OF MONEY BEING UNRIGHTEOUS</h2><p>Luke 16 speaks of the unrighteous steward and the unrighteous money. There the Lord commended the unrighteous steward for his wisdom. He used his master's money to make friends. There is a difference between the parable itself and the teaching that comes after it. The parable goes from verse 1 to verse 7, whereas the teaching begins with verse 8, which says, "The sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light.'' The unrighteous steward changed the bill of one hundred measures of oil to fifty and the bill of one hundred measures of wheat to eighty. This is unrighteousness in procedure. Surely it is wrong. But after this, the Lord teaches us to bring people into the eternal tabernacles with the mammon of unrighteousness. Here we have the money itself as being unrighteous. Not only is the procedure unrighteous, but money itself is unrighteous. The parable says that the procedure is unrighteous, but the teaching says that money is unrighteous. Money itself is unrighteous in nature and substance. The parable does not say that wheat is unrighteous or that oil is unrighteous. Instead, it says that the person is unrighteous; he is an unrighteous steward. The teaching says that even money itself is unrighteous. Some people think that money is good because the unrighteous money can give us friends, cause others to be saved, and send people to the heavenly eternal tabernacles. But we have to realize that before God the nature and substance of money is unrighteous. Today we need to repent for our attitude toward money. Money stands in opposition to God. We cannot allow one thing that is in opposition to God to exist. Either we serve God or we serve mammon. Mammon demands man's worship just as God demands our worship. Once this matter is settled, our service to God becomes simple.</p><p>During these years, concerning money, the co-workers can boast that they have not been tied down with jobs for a living. Although the other brothers and sisters have more occasions to be exposed to money, they have to remember that they are serving God just as the co-workers are. We do not expect anyone among us to be a steward for his whole life and yet find no one to receive him into the eternal tabernacles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH MONEY</h2><h2 class="head2">Returning Money<br />that Comes by Unrighteous Means</h2><p>When the Israelites left Egypt, they were supposed to take as much gold as possible with them (Exo. 12:35-36). If the money that we have comes from righteous means, we can give as much as we want. But if it is gained through unrighteous means, we have to return it. Some people will never let go of the money in their hands. From now on we have to maintain our Christian standing. We should have the sense that we can rise above others' heads in the matter of money. Others consider money as their life, but we do not. Money that we gain through righteous means can be kept, but money that we gain through unrighteous means should be returned.</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Occupations that Do Not Increase<br />the Value of Goods</h2><p>With some kinds of money, it is all right to make it as a businessman, but not all right to make it as a friend. These are things that we can have no part in. In short, we can only deal with this matter by taking care of the principles; we cannot deal with it in detail. It is wrong to buy with a view to speculate. But if a man moves some goods from one place to another, it is a work of labor, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, if there is the need for bribery in the process of doing this, we are again faced with temptation. In choosing our occupations we should take the broadest possible way, and we should avoid dangerous bridges as much as possible, because with these bridges there is always the danger of falling, and the fall can be quite serious. Always remember that the mentality of a businessman is on making money. This mentality does not revolve around need, but around money. It is not a question of righteousness or unrighteousness, but a question of our occupation.</p><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Is an occupation with the insurance business all right? (Everyone smiled, but there was no answer.)</p><p>Watchman Nee: Today we should walk on the safe side as far as our occupations are concerned. It is not worthwhile for us to stumble because of our occupations. If I am looking for a place to live, I will never settle at the border next to Siberia. It is foolish to do that, because I would be the first one to be shot if someone came across the border. The wise way is to settle far away from the border.</p><p>If we want to serve God, we cannot remain at the border. We can answer questions like Brother Weigh's a thousand times, and the problem will still not be solved. The safe way is to move a little farther away from the border. The main thing is that our occupations should not involve a mere increase in dollars; there should be an increase in the value of goods. Any work that is of a service nature is always more noble than work that is purely commercial in nature. A Christian should maintain a high standard in the occupation he chooses. We have to study the noblest way for money to be earned. There is a difference between running a woodcraft store and being a carpenter. A carpenter improves on something from nature, whereas a store owner merely sells wooden wares. The latter is commercial in nature. It is always wise to stand on the safe side as far as our occupations are concerned.</p><p>Perhaps Paul did not have the time to sell tents himself. Perhaps Mark sold them for him. If that was the case, Mark would have been acting as an agent. This kind of business can still be considered permissible. If I go into some kind of manufacturing business with three or five brothers, and one of us works as the sales agent, this is different from pure buying and selling. Hence, we see the need of coordination here.</p><h2 class="head2">Giving Up Occupations that Contain Elements<br />of Danger or Temptations</h2><p>As for those occupations that contain elements of danger or temptations, we have to give them up. Some resignations involve time and cannot be completed right away. At any rate, it is wrong to take money from others' pockets. We have to settle the matter of occupation by taking care of the basic problem. All occupations should add to the value of goods. The world should see something added to it through my occupation. Works of a commercial nature increase money, but do not increase goods. If there is only an increase in wealth without an increase in goods, it is wrong. It is unjustified for us to take from society without giving back to society.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING BROTHER NEE'S<br />OPERATION OF HIS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS</h2><p>I think I have to say a few words to the brothers who are holding jobs. Among those with whom I have been having fellowship, the matter I am about to share has been quite clear. My personal affairs should also be handed over to the brothers and sisters and be left to their arrangement. It is a long story, and there is no need for me to go into the details of it. But there are certain things that I need to say. At the beginning I told the brothers that if one day I, Watchman Nee, had to go into business, it would be to the shame of all the brothers who are in business. When the co-workers at times tried to go into business together, I always did my best to stop them. As a result, I began to hear words behind my back, saying that I would only allow myself to go into business, but would not allow others to do the same. At that time I said to others, "It is enough that I have gone into it already. There is no need for all of you to do the same.'' Later, I allowed three other co-workers to be involved with it.</p><p>From 1931 to 1937 the number of workers among us increased. At that time many said that they lived by faith. However, they engaged themselves in many "methods'' and "schemes.'' This disgusted me. I told two or three of the so-called co-workers, who are no longer with us, that they are "living by faith,'' but that I am not living by that kind of faith. What I once said to the brothers in business, the co-workers, and the ones who were so-called living by faith, I say again today; I will not change what I have said. I begged these three groups of people not to put up their signboard of living by faith. I was hoping that there could be a fourth kind of people, those who can arrange work for the brothers and sisters, and who can help some brothers to live with a peaceful conscience. Although I dared not hope to give them much money, at least I hoped that I could help them get by in their living and to live with a peaceful conscience.</p><p>At the beginning ninety-eight percent of the pharmaceutical enterprise was in my hand, or in the hands of those who had put their trust in me. Later, this became eighty percent. After some time I was left with only sixty-five percent. After the war some requested to withdraw, and my part increased again to become eighty percent.</p><p>I went into the business at the beginning with one hope. My situation today is like a widow with a few children, who hopes to raise them up, but who fails. Eventually the widow remarries, and after a while the children are all gone. By that time she cannot tell why she had remarried in the first place. My hope today is the same as it was then. In between, however, something happened, and I cannot tell you why there was a "remarriage.''</p><p>For over a year I have not involved myself in many things. When Brother Lee came to Foochow, the fellowship was recovered. But I must say again: My feeling today is the same as it was in 1939. Thank the Lord that in these days Brother Witness has the same feelings that I do. We feel that there are many books we need to write and many hymns we need to put out. We hope to prepare a new translation of the New Testament. Yet these things are left undone. Some young co-workers wanted me to resume some responsibilities, but time does not allow me to do the same things any longer. If I could return to 1939, it might be possible to have another beginning.</p><p>Because of the four turmoils and the four incidents of unfaithfulness, money that would have been enough to purchase two or three meeting halls has slipped out of our hands. Last year, when money was in our hands, it was worth over four hundred thousand dollars. Now, other than the seventy-three thousand dollars that we owe to others, there is still over two hundred thousand dollars in our hands. The money I have in my hands is trust funds; it is what others have entrusted to me. I want to tell you that I am not running away from anything. From now on this trust fund will be entirely in your hands. Twenty or thirty percent of the shares is in my hands...I cannot do it now, and perhaps you will not allow me to do it now either....What we personally feel in these days is a small thing. Nevertheless, my personal feeling is that, as I have been telling you these days, there must be some to come forward to offer.</p><p>Concerning the brothers who are in business, forgive me for saying a few uncomplimentary words: You have taken too much upon yourselves. It seems as if somebody is telling me something. Actually, no one is telling me anything....One sister, Amy Carmichael, who went to India to preach the gospel, was much helped financially by some others....Everyone is needed.</p><p>I have to say a few words for my co-workers. I know how Brother Lee spent his days in Chefoo. Some co-workers' children could not go to school and were starving at home. Among us we have five widows who are without any care. Even today Brother Tseng Li-san's child is still unable to graduate from elementary school. Today, among us, the number of widows left behind by former co-workers is not five, but twenty. While the husbands of these sisters were alive, they gave up their positions and their jobs. After they died, they were all forgotten. My co-workers, I cannot say that I am good. I admit that I have my shortcomings. We come short in the work, in offering, and in the Lord's grace. But I ask myself, "Why is it that among my co-workers, other than Brother Li-san who was killed by the Communists, ninety percent have died of tuberculosis?'' On the one hand, I have to say that we have not been responsible enough. On the other hand, I thought that it was I who persuaded them to leave their jobs. You may say that you trust in God and that God can take care of them. But when I saw them one by one passing away and dying, I was angry. I may have done many wrong things, but God knows why I have done them....[Editor's note: At this point, Brother Nee wept, and everyone wept bitterly.] You may say that I have not been frugal enough. But you do not know my position. If this matter is not settled, many other things cannot be settled.</p><p>I do not count on receiving my reward before God. I admit that I had my mistakes. I looked for a way. I told others that CBC [the pharmaceutical enterprise] is a business corporation. I was hoping that I could render some help to those brothers and sisters in need. But I have no liberty in this matter. There should not have been the need for me to say all these things. But since you have handed yourselves over, I also should hand myself over.</p><p>We spent fifty thousand dollars on Kuling, another forty thousand dollars on Foochow. For the purchase of the land in Shanghai, we spent four hundred seventy thousand dollars. We have to give everything we have for the gospel. If possible, in the future, please do not force me to do the same thing as I have done. If my co-workers have to do the same thing again, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of you brothers who are in business.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER LEE'S FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>For many years, God's blessings have been among us; they have never left us. God's responsibility is still on our shoulders. We are not "watching the sky from the well,'' looking at the outside from our small circles. We do believe that God's blessing has not left us. Our responsibility on earth is not finished yet. I do not know how many burdens there are on our shoulders. Brothers, the population of our country occupies one-fourth of the population of the whole world. The most unreached continent in the whole world is Asia, and the most unreached land in Asia is China. The gospel is like a relay race. The Western brothers have sent the gospel to China. But there was no blessing, because there was no outreach from China. This is not God's principle. At least the gospel has to spread throughout the whole of China. Today we can stand on a lofty ground and say that God can do everything. But who will meet the need? If we are not faithful, God will cause a reaction. If we are not faithful this time, the blessing will come again. But when it does, there will be confusion. It is like a farmer directing water to his field; there must be the proper water ducts. Without the ducts and the ditches, the water will flow all over. If we are more faithful before the Lord and dig a deeper channel, the water will flow better. God has put us in this place; it is a blessed place. Here we need two groups of people. One is the group that offer their time and bodies for the work of the gospel. The other is the group that offer their money for the gospel.</p><p>My words are for both groups of people. I speak to myself, and I speak to the brothers and sisters. In 1943 I went through a severe trial. For a few days I was asking the Lord why my way was so difficult. Although I cannot say that there was a time when I had nothing to put on my stove, I did fall ill of tuberculosis. It was hard financially. It was hard circumstantially. I was tired in my body, and the Japanese were threatening me. At that time God provided for me sixteen hundred U.S. dollars through a sister. But later, when I tried to escape, not one dollar was with me. I admit that I felt frustrated. For some time I was financially at the end of the rope. I could not hold on any longer. I almost collapsed. I told the Lord that I would never admit that my way was wrong. If I were to die that way, let it be so. Yet I would never admit that my way was wrong.</p><p>One day a co-worker came to see me, and he asked, "Should I go back to my job?'' I was not weeping outside, but I was weeping inside. I said, "Between the two things, you have to consider what is God's will; you have to consider if God has called you to be full-time and if He has given you the commission.'' When I said that, I was suppressing God's feeling within me. I saw the difficult circumstances, and I could not bring myself to say what I should have said. That was why I told him to go back to his job.</p><p>I do not say that I have done a good work. In Chefoo many people have asked me to help to train some young ones. I was not so strict with them. If I had been stricter, I would have said, "The way is here before you. It is up to you to take it or not to take it.'' Everything will have its final reckoning before the Lord....We have to admit that God's blessing is among us, and it has exceeded the financial limitations that we have put on Him.</p><p>From last year until today, we have been trying to buy some land. Because our requirements are so high, and the supply has not come up to the need, what we have received up until today, including what Brother Nee has come up with, is only enough to buy half of the proposed land. If we had three to four hundred gold bars in our hands, the new meeting hall would have been finished nine months ago. This matter is a big burden upon us. Now brothers everywhere have handed themselves over. It may seem that if we go on this way, we will stir up trouble. But even if we are to stir up trouble, and even if we are to die for it, we have to strive on. In the summer over one hundred brothers and sisters will have to be trained in Foochow. Every one of them needs three million dollars for support. How much money do we need here!</p><p>My co-workers, I admit that the way ahead is not easy. I admit that there will be sufferings. You brothers who are holding jobs should ask the Lord and inquire of Him. How should these problems be solved?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>I beg that all of you would take up the things that are in my hands. For you to go into business, there is no shame. But for me to go into business, there is the shame. But I will still say that the responsibility today is on your shoulders.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: Wednesday, April 21, 1948, 6:30 a.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Nature: Testimonies and questions by the co-workers, and exhortations by Watchman Nee</h1><h2 class="head1">INDIVIDUALS HANDING OVER<br />RESULTING IN THE BODY TAKING OVER</h2><p>Du Chung-chun: What occupations are considered proper?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Brother Chu once said, "If I hand something over to the Body, I do not have to take care of it any longer. It is no longer my business, but the Body's business.'' This is rightly put. Your burden is no longer on your shoulders, but on the shoulders of the brothers and sisters and the church. If you hand yourself over, everything becomes the Lord's. If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money. Our principle is to let the dead bury the dead. We have to know that serving God is not just a matter of serving God alone, but of serving Him in the Body. Today by the grace of God, we have handed ourselves over. If we merely say with our mouths that we are serving God, nobody knows when we have stopped this service. This kind of service is not definite. However, if we hand ourselves over, we cannot turn back even if we want to. We may say that we cannot walk, but many others will carry us; they can move us. If our service is for the church, we will be able to give up even the things that we could not otherwise give up. It is not a matter of our own arrangement, but a matter of the Lord's arrangement in the Body. It is a tremendous thing for a person to decide to consecrate himself. However, this thing is not done individually, but in the Body.</p><p>Brother Chow asked: In the future should the brothers engage in business by using the name of the church? (No answer from Brother Nee.)</p><h2 class="head1">SISTER RUTH LEE'S FELLOWSHIP AND TESTIMONY</h2><p>I have asked for permission already from the other brothers concerning what I am about to say. It all happened about thirteen years ago. At that time I wanted to have an apartment, but I cannot go into detail about the reason for having it....Although I have been negative in recent years, there was still a supply from the brothers. Brother Chu gave me ten thousand dollars, and when Brother Chang Tze-jieh came from Tsingtao, he gave me a few thousand dollars. From that time on I decided to set aside a certain amount from what I have received....When I moved back from the countryside, I saw many more white-haired people in the church. The next time I came back, there were even more with white hair....The sisters had given up all their savings, and some sisters had to stay in the hospital and could not go home....What I have can only become less; it will never become more. All the money that I have is enough to feed one more person for a month only; it will be gone by the second month. I can sleep on the floor and let others sleep on my bed. But others will not feel comfortable sleeping this way. If we have to provide a place for others to rest, it should be a place where others can rest comfortably. I felt that somehow I have to have a place that is like a home, that others will not feel ashamed or burdensome to live in, and which is close to the meeting hall. Only then will such a place be able to render others some spiritual help....When a person gets older, she tends to develop her own peculiarities. Others say that living together provides fellowship. Actually, living together provides frustrations. This is why I have hoped all the time to have a place that can provide hospitality for the saints. Brother Lee said that perhaps they can provide a place for me in Chefoo.</p><p>Today I ask Brother Nee to forgive me for all my past attitudes and words. I also ask the responsible brothers to forgive me for my past attitudes and words. I was sympathetic toward Brother Nee's venture into business. Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I heard many words, and they made me angry. Eventually, these angers spilled over to Brother Nee. Brother Nee said, "The magistrates are the only ones that can light a fire; the common folks should not even light a lamp.'' [Translator's note: A Chinese idiom meaning that only a few are allowed to do something, referring to Brother Nee's venture into business.] I am not Brother Nee, and I cannot speak for him in many things. When others said that Brother Nee was wrong, how could I take such words? I could not single out Brother Nee for blame. As a result I began to blame the other responsible brothers. Since they had promised that [the business venture] was God's will already, how could I stop other brothers and sisters? Yet when others came to me, they were bothered to the point of a mental breakdown, and I could not help but sympathize with them. It is God's grace that I have not had a mental breakdown today. Even if ninety-nine percent of the responsibility lies with others, I still hold one percent of the responsibility. Actually, I should say that I hold more than one percent of the responsibility.</p><p>At one time some people criticized The Normal Christian Church Life and asked me to say something bad about Brother Nee. People wanted to use me as a tool to oppose Brother Nee.</p><p>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I did tell people that it was a "gossip center.'' My motive concerning the business was bitter, and my attitude toward Brother Nee was also bitter. I would not say that I have never condemned anything; there were indeed things which I took offense in. Once a person got involved with the CBC Lab, their spiritual condition collapsed. If what has happened these few days had happened then, none of what I am saying would need to be said.</p><p>I wish that the tears I shed today would be my last tears. I wish that when I leave the world one day, and others open up my closets, they will find them empty. If my closets are full, it will be to my shame. I realize that it is better to prefer poverty than to prefer wealth. During these years, I did have the thought of selling everything I have. Sometimes I cannot recognize my own belongings. Others always push me to buy something for myself, but I always give this and that kind of excuse. I seldom buy things for myself. When I bought an overcoat, three people literally dragged me to the store to buy it. I do not care much for my own clothing. I am not saving things in my closets and keeping them for myself. As for cash, I cannot come up with even a thousand dollars. I do not have a single piece of gold with me. I can testify for my conscience' sake that all that I have is worth nothing; everything I have is what I need for myself. Of course, I can hand over my rice and my oil. I can give my last drop to the church.</p><p>When the church proposed to buy a piece of land the last time, some people were blaming others, while others were plainly sitting back and watching. At that time twenty pieces of gold would have done the job. But we waited and waited until all the money was gone, and everyone was still sitting there watching. Because of this, we accomplished nothing. This is wrong. If everyone hands himself over today, what follows is the responsibility of the church. I open up myself this way today out of necessity. My words end here.</p><h2 class="head1">REQUIREMENTS OF A WORKER</h2><h2 class="head2">A Proper and Pure Spirit</h2><p>One brother asked: When is it the time to say, "Speak, O Jehovah; for Your servant is listening'' (1 Sam. 3:9)?</p><p>Watchman Nee: In the past the brothers in all the localities gave the co-workers many headaches. Some people were quite zealous outwardly, and they wanted to work full-time. The brothers in those localities went ahead and acknowledged such ones as co-workers, and they received such ones as co-workers on our behalf. This brought us many problems. We cannot recognize such acknowledgments. Those who serve with the ministry of the word should learn to touch others' spirit. A servant of God should know, when others are speaking, whether the speaker's spirit is in accord with him or is in contradiction to him. The spirit of some is improper or defiled. There is no way for us to remove their defilements. For example, you may come and tell me that Brother Suen is wrong. If Brother Hsu comes along and asks me how Brother Suen is doing, I cannot tell him Brother Suen's mistakes. Even if I were to tell Brother Hsu the mistakes, he may not believe me. Hence, we hope that all those who wish to serve the Lord full-time will first learn some lessons in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Waiting for Confirmation</h2><p>I am not saying that those who want to give themselves to the work have to be perfect in any sense. However, their spirit has to be pure and simple before the Lord. You may not know the kind of spirit you have. Up to a certain point, everyone else may say that now is the time for you to drop your job. By that time you should drop your job. Even though some have a heart to serve full-time, they should still wait in their jobs for a while. The question is whether or not the Lord wants such a one to drop everything to serve God at that time.</p><p>Our brother Philip Luan died because of our unfaithfulness. He left his job but did not receive adequate care. We can hardly find another brother who loved the Lord as much as he did. We did not have enough light. If we did, and we realized the hardship in the environment, we would have persuaded him to go back to his job. Everyone should have the same need in the preaching of the gospel. Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has a good job at the customs department. He has been working there for many years. He has not asked if he should drop that job, but we feel that he should drop it. Everyone has to offer up himself to the Lord. Those brothers and sisters who are in their jobs are not the first-class citizens. Unless everyone offers up everything, we have no way to go on.</p><h2 class="head2">"Offer Up Yourselves''</h2><p>Suen Chang-ming: Everyone should be a priest. This kind of service is a matter of coordination. In our factory we have to support one hundred workers, and the burden is already very heavy. In Acts 2 and 4 there were over eight thousand people that needed support. How did they do it?</p><p>Watchman Nee: After the war the CBC Laboratory was worth eight hundred thousand dollars. Last year it was worth only four hundred thousand. This year it is worth 1.2 million. Yet we owe others seven hundred thousand dollars. We have no idea what will happen next year.</p><p>When we were going to buy the land from Mrs. Chow, some consecrated all they had by selling everything. I felt that that money was blood money. After I made the announcement the first and second time, I dared not make any more announcements, because all the ones who were giving money were middle-class and lower middle-class saints. Those who had the money and who should have offered were slow to move.</p><p>After that first failure I dared not ask others for money again. I told others that, should we have to build a meeting hall, I would do it myself. Sister Ruth Lee may have harbored some complaints against me, that I did not take care of so many works that were necessary, and that instead I went into business. But in order for the work to be done properly, some have to sacrifice themselves. I can say this word to you today: I have done my work, and I have sacrificed myself. Today I am a part of those who are sharing responsibilities in the work, and I am also a part of those who are holding jobs. I am not an insensitive person. For you to go into business, there is no sense of shame. But for me to go into business, there is the sense of shame. I know that with this matter some have something to say about me, and I can tell you that some have come and questioned me. Even now, I risk bearing the shame of receiving no greetings on the street. I risk bearing the shame of "remarrying'' myself as a widow, so much so that the children are gone, and I am left wondering why I was doing what I was doing, with a dead child in my arms. For eight years I could not lift up my face and look into the brothers' and sisters' eyes. Do I not have the right today to say to you, "Offer up yourselves''? Why would you not offer up yourselves? Today is the time for all the working brothers and sisters to offer up themselves.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE SERVICE OF THE WHOLE BODY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 24, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">ALL REDEEMED ONES NEEDING TO SERVE GOD</h2><p>Presently, among God's children there seems to be a common phenomenon that only a certain group of people are serving. However, God's Word says that everyone who belongs to God is a servant of God. When the Israelites were in Egypt serving as slaves, they did not have any freedom. God delivered them out of Egypt and through the Red Sea for the purpose of serving Him in the wilderness (Exo. 3:18). The number of people under the blood was the number of people who left Egypt. The number of saved ones was the number of serving ones. When the Israelites left Egypt, they brought all the gold and silver with them (Exo. 12:35-36). Therefore, all of the ones who were redeemed served God in material offerings and followed the tabernacle. There was not just a minority who served. In both the Old Testament and New Testament, there is not a distinction between ones who serve and ones who do not serve. Only degraded Christianity makes such a distinction.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND ITS CHANGES</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Salvation Being to Obtain<br />a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>God said explicitly that He would make the Israelites a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). Priests are those who wait on God and follow God. No one is able to come closer to God than the priests. Their job is to serve God. The Israelites were to be a kingdom of priests; the whole nation was to be priests.</p><p>The priests' eating, living, and slaughtering of bulls and goats were all for the purpose of serving God. The proper profession of the priests was to serve God; everything else was a sideline. They did not work as teachers, doctors, or in any other profession. Exodus 19 tells us that God intended that all the Israelites, old or young, great or small, male or female, were to be priests.</p><p>The goal of God's salvation is to gain priests (Rev. 1:5-6a). The blood of the Passover lamb delivered the Israelites with the goal of obtaining and ushering in a kingdom of priests. The greatest calling and also the greatest grace is that men can serve God as priests. The number of those who left Egypt was the number of those who should have served God. The number of those who reached Sinai was the number of those who should have served the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Degradation of the Israelites Resulting in<br />a Kingdom of Priests Becoming a Tribe of Priests</h2><p>At the bottom of Mount Sinai, the Israelites worshipped the golden calf and sinned against God. As a result, Moses told the people to kill their own brothers. However, only the Levites obeyed Moses' words; they killed three thousand men (Exo. 32:1-29). The loss of three thousand men was not the greatest loss. The greatest loss was that all the people could no longer be priests. Originally, the twelve tribes were to be priests. Now only one tribe was left (Num. 8:5-19). Originally, there was to be a kingdom of priests. Now there became a tribe of priests. The Levites did not care for human feelings or sentiments; they stood on God's side. As a result, they gained the priesthood. Here we see that some had forsaken their priesthood. They forsook it through the worship of the idol; they established another worship.</p><p>Because of rebellion, the earth opened up its mouth and swallowed up the rebellious ones (Num. 16:30-33). Only one tribe was selected to serve God. Only Aaron's rod budded; all the other rods remained dead (Num. 17:6-10). After the people lost their standing before God, they could come to God only through the priests. Even those who had a heart to come to God were kept outside. The eleven tribes became those who were far from God, and only the Levites were the ones who drew near to God. The eleven tribes became those who could only come to God indirectly, whereas the Levites were the ones who could come to God directly. The eleven tribes became the ones who were served, while the Levites became the serving ones.</p><p>The book of Judges shows that the Levites became excessively honored because the Israelites could not serve, even if they had money. The Israelites had to ask the Levites to serve for them (Judg. 17), and it took a great effort for men to invite a Levite to serve in their house.</p><h2 class="head2">In the New Testament, God's Desire Being<br />for the Church to Be a Kingdom of Priests</h2><p>This arrangement lasted for over fifteen hundred years. During this time eleven tribes were kept outside the tabernacle. Only the tribe of Levi was admitted into the tabernacle. This lasted until the New Testament age, as Peter said in his first Epistle, "But you are...a royal priesthood'' (2:9). Now every believer has become a servant of God. At the end of the New Testament, when John was about to die in A.D. 95, he said that we have been made "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father'' (Rev. 1:6). God's intention toward the church today is for every believer to be a priest. We are a kingdom of priests. What the Israelites lost, God is recovering through the church. Through their unfaithfulness, the Israelites lost the priestly kingdom. God's intention today is for every Christian to be recovered to be a priest.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</h2><h2 class="head2">All the Saved Ones Serving God</h2><p>Any service that is not in the nature of a priestly kingdom is wrong. The church has been selected out of the world. There cannot be a further selection within the church. As long as there is no sin, no fall, and no golden calf, God forbids any further separation. However many there are who are redeemed by the blood, that many should serve. The number of sons should be the number of servants as well. The number of servants should equal the number of sons. Service should include the same number that salvation includes. Today among God's people, there are only backsliding ones; there are no non-slaves or non-maids. There are only rebellious ones; there are no non-serving ones. Any service should be a service by the whole church. This is the Body service that we are talking about in these days. God is not satisfied even when ninety-nine percent of the people are serving. God wants everyone to be serving. We do not believe that a majority of the people should serve while a minority of the people do not serve. Neither do we believe that a minority of the people should serve while a majority of the people do not serve. Service is not the work of the ministers or the work of a few evangelists. We speak so much about the Body service because it is a matter that belongs to all the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head2">A Person Needing to Forsake Everything<br />to Serve God As Soon As He Is Saved</h2><p>God's Word tells us that we are those who have received God's mercy. But what should we do now? Christianity thinks that a man is saved through the Lord's blood and by His grace and then goes on further to forsake the world. As he advances further, he drops everything to serve God. This is degraded Christianity. According to God's Word, as soon as a man is saved, and as soon as he steps through the entrance, the Lord tells him to take up his cross (Matt. 16:24). A man either does not become a disciple, or he has to be one in an absolute way. The Lord sets the price clearly from the beginning for every saved one. The first day they come, they see the tomb. The first day they come, they are asked to forsake the world. We cannot lower the gospel and make the gospel no longer the gospel. The Lord never lowers the price to attract customers. The gospel is the least expensive thing there is. Yet at the same time, it is the most costly thing there is. If we are to be saved, we have to be saved in a clear way. Only those who have paid a high price can feel joy. When the young ruler returned home, his money remained with him, but so did his sorrow (Matt. 19:22). Where money is, there sorrow remains. When money goes, joy comes along. Salvation requires that a man give up everything totally. Today many brothers and sisters are sorrowful just like the young ruler. They have things in their hands that they cannot drop. The only difference between them and the young ruler is that they have not returned home yet; they are still meeting here. If we want joy, we have to consecrate ourselves fully and offer up everything.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Consecrating,<br />Ushering in a Thorough Service</h2><p>Last year I asked a student at Chiao-Tung University how he would feel if someone were to slap him on his right cheek. If someone slapped your right cheek, you would be angry when you went home. However, those who are joyful before the Lord are the ones who turn their left cheek to the enemy after being slapped on the right cheek. After a person has been slapped twice, he will be joyful, and he will be able to utter praise. The Lord's way is the way of absoluteness. Those who are not absolute cannot sing. I am not begging people to come to serve. I am showing you that you are a servant of God. God wants you to serve.</p><p>This conference is a co-workers' conference, but this does not mean that the responsibility is only on the co-workers. Today the responsibility is on the whole Body. When we read 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12, we see that service belongs to the whole Body; it is not a service of three or five special people. Therefore, we asked all the brothers and sisters to hand themselves over. The Lord wants absolute service. We hope that every brother and sister can get through in this matter. The Lord wants such an absolute service. It is not just the co-workers who need coordination in their work; rather, every brother and sister needs to be coordinated.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ONLY SERVICE THAT COUNTS<br />BEING THE BODY SERVICE</h2><p>I want to ask the brothers a few questions. What kind of service is considered real service? The only service that counts is the service in which the whole Body serves. Only the Body service can be counted as real service. Either you are not a Christian, or you are a serving Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">FULL COORDINATION<br />BRINGING IN THE BODY SERVICE</h2><p>In order to have the Body service, there is the need for coordination. What is coordination? It is not a loose arrangement. If my hands are connected to my body, they will be useful. But if they are locked up upstairs, they will not be useful.</p><p>Since you became a Christian, have you ever inquired of the Lord concerning your job, your house, and your business? Is your job suitable for the gospel? When a man moves to a new place, he considers whether the place is beneficial to him spiritually. But he never considers whether his job will enable him to give himself to the gospel. Today our co-workers cannot seek their own convenience in the work; they cannot freely choose their own field. The brothers and sisters who hold jobs should do the same thing in principle. We have to hand over our job, and we should learn to coordinate together. In other words, all the brothers and sisters are co-workers. Everyone should hand himself over for the gospel. If there is to be coordination, it has to be a coordination of all the brothers and sisters. Some of us have to change our dwelling or occupations, and all of us have to offer up our possessions. This is a great price. It may cause some to have heartaches. From the very beginning we have to realize that the Lord requires that we serve this way. Any service that involves a dragging of the feet is not joyful and definite service.</p><h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION BRINGING IN SINGLENESS IN SERVICE</h2><p>We have to tell the young brothers and sisters that whatever they do in the future, whether it involves being a teacher or a doctor, can only be done as a secondary occupation. Every one of us lives for the purpose of serving God. We tell people to offer up their possessions because we can never serve God without offering up our possessions. The Lord says that a man cannot serve two masters; he cannot serve God and mammon at the same time (Matt. 6:24). The colt must be loosed (21:2), and everything has to be offered up and released before a person can serve. Those who are not loosed cannot serve.</p><p>If anyone asks me how much he should offer, I would answer, "Everything.'' Brother Lee said that the church will lay aside the consecrated things for us. But what would we do if the church does not lay them aside? If we want to serve God, we have to serve Him in a desperate way.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING GOD BEING THE HIGHEST GLORY</h2><h2 class="head2">God Honoring Us<br />and Granting Us the Favor</h2><p>When I was in England I heard of a brother by the name of C. A. Coates. Someone once gave one of his books to the Queen of England. The Queen read the book and was helped by it. However, Coates had written eight books. When I was in England, I asked the British brothers, "Since Coates has eight books, why would he not give the other seven books to the Queen?'' The brothers did not say anything. They acted as if I had said something wrong. Later, I asked some other people and learned that a common English person could not give a book to the Queen. Even if you tried to give her a book, she might not necessarily accept it.</p><p>Consecration is God honoring us. It is not a favor we grant to God. Rather, it is God's acceptance of us and of our possessions. Hence, it is God's honor to us. We are not granting Him a favor; He is granting us a favor. For God to accept persons such as we is the greatest privilege He can grant to us. If I kneel before God and He sends a fire to consume the sacrifice, it is His favor to me in accepting my service. Man thinks that he is sacrificing himself by consecrating to God. Little does he realize that God's accepting him is His mercy. Why do we have to calculate so much? We have to learn to push our way through to serve Him, to crawl before Him, and to kneel before Him. A man should learn to humble himself before God. We are not begging you to go to God. Rather, you should beg to go to Him yourself.</p><h2 class="head2">Serving God Being to Our Profit and Being<br />the Result of the Lord's Dynamic Salvation</h2><p>The China Textile Corporation no longer dares to issue any more shares because they will be sold within half an hour. Today the blind ones are not the ones who cannot see; the blind ones are the ones who do not see. Our only fear should be that we give too little to God, that God will not accept what we give to Him. Is our consecration a profit for God, or is it a profit for us? Is it a favor we render to God, or a favor God renders to us? When we come to God, the only thing we should fear is that God will reject and deny us. We should only fear that we give to God too little, that He will not accept us. Those who know God will say, "Lord, here is some more. Here is some more.'' Those who have once seen the Lord can give half of what they have to the poor without any complaint. The Lord said to Zaccheus, "Today salvation has come to this house'' (Luke 19:9). Today many people do not realize the greatness of the Lord's salvation. This is why they encounter difficulties. Salvation not only saves our soul; it means that we are delivered from everything. Let us remember the story of our burial. Why were we baptized? Baptism is a declaration that we have been separated from the world. Merely inviting three or five people to come and serve will not solve the problem. What we need today is for the whole Body to rise up for the gospel. The demand for the co-workers in the days ahead is quite severe. The need is also very great. For the sake of China's gospel, for the sake of the co-workers going on, we need a fresh consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED IN SERVICE AND THE WAY OF SERVICE</h2><p>If I had a hundred billion dollars today, I could distribute it all for proper use within a few days. Our work needs money. From now on we have to work with a goal and with proper arrangements. All the co-workers are living for the Lord. We ask all the brothers and sisters with a job to offer up themselves also. We have to work in coordination and in the Body. None of us is for ourselves. We must live for the Lord and for the gospel. We cannot have part of the people offering up themselves, while part of the people are not offering up themselves. We need all the brothers and sisters to offer up themselves and to live for the gospel. Those who are teaching or who are in business have to offer up everything for the gospel. The Lord has to do what He did in the first century. We are not afraid of believing in the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of preaching the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of acting according to the first-century gospel. If we would rise up as a whole Body, the whole of China will be taken; no one will be able to withstand us. If we do not believe in a thorough gospel and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us.</p><p>The gospel has been preached in China for over a century, but it has been restricted to the coastal regions. Not much has been done in the inland regions. We have wasted twenty years. If we are not faithful again, we will be set aside.</p><h2 class="head1">A STRONG TESTIMONY PRODUCING A STRONG RESULT</h2><p>In the first century men were not able to preach the gospel freely. They did not go to the church buildings. At that time men believed because they saw the gospel and saw the Christians. The Christians at that time were hiding in their homes. When they were put on the fiery stakes, they were seen and heard for the first time. The effect of seeing the gospel is much stronger than that of hearing the gospel. This kind of gospel shows men that salvation is not cheap. The prayer of the martyrs during those hours became their gospel messages. Historians tell us that the believers in Rome were killed first, and the ones who were not killed were exiled.</p><p>Today Christianity is weak in others because it is weak in us. During the first century, men were afraid, yet they kept coming. Today lukewarm Christians are useless ones. On the one hand, the testimonies of the early believers frightened many people away. But on the other hand, this kind of gospel also made many frightened of running away. Where there is the apostles' service, there is the apostles' blessing. Today the whole responsibility rests on our work. If the Lord cannot get through among us, He cannot get through anywhere. The past twenty years, while we were praying and seeking, the Lord was preparing us. However, if the young ruler came today, he might not stay any longer. Today we have to offer up all our money, time, and heart. Only then will the Lord have a way, and only then can we reach our destiny. We should not allow money to choke our heart, and we should not allow it to block man's way to God. All the brothers and sisters have to participate in the spiritual work, and all possessions have to be offered up. If we do this, the Lord will have a free way among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THINGS THAT A CO-WORKER SHOULD<br />PAY ATTENTION TO</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 25, 1948, Lord's Day, 3:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF ONE'S STANDING<br />IN CONTACTING THE SAINTS</h2><h2 class="head2">Being Based on Spiritual Relationships Only</h2><p>Chang Kwang-yung: How should we take care of the many problems in coordination? When we work in different local churches, what are the things that we should take care of?</p><p>Watchman Nee: There are a few things that a worker should pay attention to. The first thing is his standing in contacting the brothers and sisters. When a worker goes to a new place, he should pay attention to his relationship with the brothers and sisters. Many times, the relationship between the co-workers and the other saints is not spiritual. The degree of intimacy in fellowship can only be determined by spiritual factors. The workers who are too strong or too weak dispositionally need special help.</p><h2 class="head2">Rejecting Any Friendship</h2><p>We have to be delivered from relationships of friendship. Friendship probably is related to sameness in disposition or compatibility in position. Some co-workers are closer to some saints because they like each other dispositionally. Some workers are burdened for some brothers and sisters because they have similar weaknesses. As a result, their friendship becomes more intimate. But this kind of relationship will not render anyone any help. In the end no brother or sister will receive deliverance through this kind of friendship. The co-workers have to cut off all relationships of friendship with the brothers and sisters. Our relationship is a spiritual one. We are not related because we are similar in our disposition, because we are from the same school, or because we were born in the same place.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Falling into Others' Weaknesses</h2><p>If we fellowship with a weak brother, we have to help him instead of falling into the same situation. We have to pull him up to another level. This is where the problem lies between our Brother Leland Wang and Brother Chang Chi-chen in Foochow.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE LED AWAY TO THE LOWLY</h2><h2 class="head2">Keeping a Distance from the Rich Ones</h2><p>The second point to pay attention to is to learn to be led away to the lowly. We have to be careful about people who are famous and who occupy high positions in society. We should keep a distance from them, lest we fall into suspicion. Not everyone can go into the home of a rich brother or sister. Sometimes one has to go through the doorkeepers in order to visit such brothers. Do not live in the houses of the rich ones. It is not a good thing for today's Christianity to be mixed up with great capitalists.</p><p>Once I was in Chefoo, and the brothers invited me to stay at the house of a well-to-do brother because of my sickness. I declined the offer. They asked me for the reason, and I told them that it has to do with my footsteps. On another occasion I went to Kaifeng to conduct some meetings. The first few days I stayed at a rich person's home. Later, I decided not to stay in the house of that government officer. Those who love to acquaint themselves with rich and influential people have lost their standing as a worker of God. I have no patience for these ones. Such ones have lost their standing in the work. Our standing is that of a worker of God. Every worker should maintain his ministerial standard. Both the Lord and the apostles rebuked the rich and the influential ones more severely and sharply than others. If we do not take care of the issue of money properly, we will leave a bad taste with others.</p><h2 class="head2">It Being a Shame to Have Selective Fellowship</h2><p>In contacting others one has to be careful that his standing does not change with an acquaintance. It is a shameful thing to have selective fellowship among the co-workers.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Listening to Others Being a Basic<br />Qualification of the Workers</h2><p>The third matter is a serious demand on the workers today. It is to learn to listen to others when they speak. The basic requirement, technique, or qualification of a worker is that he can listen to others. We have to be able to sit down for an hour and listen to the brothers and sisters. As the brothers speak, we have to be able to understand what they are saying sentence by sentence. Not only do we have to hear what they are saying; we have to be able to understand what they are saying.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Quiet Within<br />and Not Having One's Own Words</h2><p>We have to remain quiet while the brothers and sisters are speaking. We cannot be saying something else within us at the same time. Many people hear the wrong things because they are speaking within at the same time that they are listening. This is like having two radios turned on at the same time. When two different stations are speaking at the same time, one cannot hear clearly what either one is saying. In the same way, if a man cannot listen to others, it is because he is speaking when they are speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">Touching Others' Spirit with the Spirit</h2><p>There is another point concerning listening. Man's spirit is revealed through his mouth. When a man speaks, his spirit is released, and it touches the spirit of others. A man's spirit is released through his speaking. If you cannot listen to others, you will not be able to touch their spirit. Whether or not a worker is strong in his work depends on whether he is able to touch others' spirit with his spirit. It is difficult to find one in a thousand who can detect others' spirit without listening to their words. Whether a man's spirit is rebellious, defiled, strong, weak, or in any other condition, it is expressed through his words. We have to be an objective person. Only an objective person can listen to others speak. This is the greatest need in our work.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK ACCURATELY</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Speaking Carelessly or Loosely<br />and Not Being Double-tongued</h2><p>The fourth thing that a worker has to learn is to speak accurately in his daily life. A careless person has no hope as far as participation in God's work is concerned. A double-tongued person cannot help anyone in any church; he can only cause trouble. Some brothers have asked me how they should study the Bible. I can tell you that only an accurate man can study the Bible. Some people cannot study the Bible by nature. Even if you were to send such a one to seminary, it would still be useless. He may be able to study philosophy, but he can never study science. Science is accurate, and knowledge in science is acquired through numerous experiments and verifications. In the Lord's work there is no such thing as "more or less the same.'' Either things are the same or they are not the same. For example, the whiteness of snow is different from the whiteness of a white horse. But the careless ones will say that they are the same.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Speaking from Feelings</h2><p>The sisters should pay particular attention to this matter. In their daily life they should be careful; they should speak properly, sentence by sentence. The careless ones, those who are active in their mind and who have a hard time differentiating between real and false things, are of little use in God's hand. The more we want to be accurate in our speaking, the more troublesome it is. It is easy to be careless. But a careless person can only speak from his feeling; he cannot speak accurate words. However, truth is absolute. It cannot change according to your feeling. Truth is not affected by anything.</p><h2 class="head2">Only an Accurate Person<br />Being Able to Receive Light from the Bible</h2><p>Who can study the Bible? The Bible is not understood through methods, but through proper persons. A person can listen to, study, and read the Bible. But if he wants to get some light, he has to be an accurate person.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APPOINTMENT OF ELDERS</h2><p>The fifth point concerns the appointment of responsible brothers. Not everyone can appoint elders. Paul asked Timothy to appoint elders, but he did not ask Mark, Silas, Luke, or Demas to appoint elders. Some are hands; they cannot be the eyes. Some people say that they have to consider more. But if you are a hand, will you know whether a pillar is white simply by more consideration? Even if you considered for five days, you would not be clear whether the pillar was white. It is better for you to seek the help of the eyes. It is easy to appoint a person, but it is troublesome to ask anyone to step down from responsibility. If you do this, the whole church will be greatly affected. For this reason, we cannot appoint responsible ones lightly. Paul asked Timothy to look for faithful ones. This is not an easy matter.</p><p>When the Western missionaries select personnel, most of the time they select the good and the lovable persons. To us these ones may be the most useless; they may even be swindlers. Some people ask why we do not appoint certain brothers as responsible ones. We have to realize that some brothers are good people and nice gentlemen, but they can easily be deceived. Do not say that this is only the missionaries' problem; the Chinese can have the same problem. It is not a light matter for a man to receive a ministry before the Lord. There are certain basic qualifications in appointing a person. It is not such a simple matter.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE PHYSICAL NEEDS<br />OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking Simple Luggage When Traveling</h2><p>Sixth, the co-workers should pay special attention to their physical needs. Concerning our personal life, the Lord's principle is first that our personal belongings have to be simple when we travel. It is too improper for a worker to travel with five or ten pieces of luggage.</p><h2 class="head2">Eating What Others Serve</h2><p>Second, we must pay attention to how we eat. Whatever others put in front of us, we have to eat. Other than for the reason of physical weakness, we have to make ourselves persons who are easy to be served. When we are at home, we can do whatever we like. But when we are traveling, it is not so simple.</p><p>Once I was in Anhwei province. The people there like sesame oil, but I hate sesame oil. I had sesame oil continually for sixteen days. When they saw that my appetite was not good, they asked if I would like some preserved eggs. I said yes, and they served me preserved eggs, but they were also soaked in sesame oil!</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Overcome Our Bodies in Our Dwelling</h2><p>The third thing is related to the place where we live. The co-workers should not pick places for sleeping that are too good or too coarse. They have to select moderate places. Once they have decided where to stay, they should stay there until they leave the city. Even if you find that you are staying in a lion's den, you have to wait until daybreak. If the king has not come, you cannot go out by yourself. Unless others make further arrangements for you, you should not make any choice of your own. Many workers are involved in trouble merely through moving around.</p><p>Once someone prepared a bed for me. It was supposed to be a sofa bed, but it was a bed that no one could lie on. The bed was put together with blocks of wood. When I turned over, the wood would make noise. I was disturbed not only by others' noise, but by the noise I made also. A worker has to learn to live in abundance, and he also has to learn to live in poverty. A worker must learn to overcome his body.</p><p>There was a brother in southern Fukien province who had a somewhat higher standard of living at home. When he had to work in a place that had a lower standard of living, he found that he could not handle the situation. What we eat and wear and how we live at home are personal matters before the Lord. But when we are guests in others' homes, we have to live according to the standard of that family. Habit is one thing, and a mind to suffer is another thing. No matter how weak we are or how many needs we have, we have to learn to lower ourselves. Do not let any church think that it is a troublesome thing to provide hospitality for a servant of God. If we practice living in a low way at home, we will be able to stand it even when others put us in a lower place. Only those who have learned to overcome their bodies present no difficulty to others. Only a mind to suffer can give us the strength to humble ourselves before men. Hence, we have to learn to overcome our bodies.</p><h2 class="head2">Knowing How to Live in Abundance&mdash;<br />Taking Only What One Needs</h2><p>Chang Kwang-yung: Sometimes after I deliver a message, I feel hungry, and good food is placed before me. If I eat too much, it would be embarrassing. What should I do? After working in a place, when I am about to leave, others try to give me gifts. What should I do? If I do not accept them, the host is offended. But if I accept them, should I give something in return later?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We have to know how to live in abundance. However, to live in abundance does not mean to enjoy abundance. I know when to eat and when not to eat. A person who is careless in eating is one who has never been restricted before God. If I really need a chicken, I can eat a chicken every day. If I do not need it, I could refuse if five chickens were served in front of me. In principle I eat only the portion served to me.</p><p>When Satan sinned, he craved for the throne. When man sinned, he craved for food. It is not a matter of eating much or eating little, but a matter of eating what is placed in front of you. I will not make additional requests on top of what others are serving me. When we live among others, we should maintain our standing. Otherwise, we will give others a bad impression about the gospel. When many young workers are about to be sent out for some work, I invite them to a good meal. That one meal determines whether or not a worker will go out. Perhaps this is not a good thing to say, because the next time it will not be an easy thing for me to invite anyone for meals.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING RECEIVING GIFTS</h2><h2 class="head2">Accepting in Love and Sharing with Others</h2><p>Concerning the matter of receiving gifts, I can tell you a story. In 1937 I was in Manila. At the end of my stay, the brothers and sisters sent me away on a ship with a crate of fruit. Inside the crate were one hundred eighty to two hundred pieces of fruit. If I spread out the fruit in my cabin, I could have almost started a fruit store. But by the time I left the ship and went on shore, I did not have one piece of fruit left; I had given it all away to the attendants. Although they were not poor with regard to money, they were poor with regard to fruit. If I went home with two hundred pieces of fruit, what would others think? They would say what a scene that a preacher would come back with so much fruit.</p><h2 class="head2">No Need to Give Others Gifts in Return</h2><p>If others give us gifts, we cannot give gifts to them in return. If we do, this kind of thing will never end. We cannot turn down the brothers' and sisters' love. But I would rather share with the poor such love. If others invite me for a meal, I would rather eat five bowlfuls and send the other five bowlfuls to the poor outside the door.</p><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY AND EXHORTATIONS</h2><p>Hsia Hsi-ling from Tientsin: The church in Tientsin began in 1936. By the grace of the Lord, we have been in one accord for the last twelve years. As long as there are two or three who are faithful, the testimony can be maintained. Four major events happened during these years. The first was the political turmoil, the second was the flood, the third was the war in Asia, and the fourth was the so-called North China Christian Alliance. Presently, we have about one hundred people breaking bread. Among them, two or three brothers are particularly living and fresh. The responsible brothers are Hsia Hsi-ling and Lee Pi. Presently, we use the meeting hall for prayer, and the place is too small.</p><p>Watchman Nee's word of exhortation: We hope that Brother Hsia can leave his job and be free from the bondage of money. Money should only help us in the gospel; it should not hinder the gospel. In assigning the co-workers we should take the most economical way. We must see that God is moving before we move.</p><p>The work in Tsingtao should face west along the railway line. The work in Shanghai should face the direction of the Yangtze River. The work in Tientsin should face the east as well as the west. What we have at present should be strengthened. If some brothers feel clear to go, we should release them to go.</p><p>Brother Mak from Swatow: I began to learn to come into the service in 1940. I stayed in Sian for six years. Presently, I am in Swatow. There are about three hundred saints who are in fellowship with us. We are short of brothers who can give messages.</p><p>Watchman Nee's exhortation: The Gospels contain the story of the woman with an issue of blood. There were many people at that time. The object of their touching was the same, yet the result of their touching was not the same. Everyone was touching Christ, but the woman's touching was different from the others'. Others may have touched His back or His arms. They may even have torn His garment, but there was no result. The same kind of people may be praying in tears; the same kind of people may be touching the Lord. Everything may be the same, but the result is not the same. We have to see that there is another world behind the visible things. If we are not careful, we will become the crowd that was pressing against the Lord. There were many who were following the Lord and many who were touching Him. But only one person's touch resulted in a change in life. Outwardly, everyone was touching Him, but if one were to dig deeper, he would discover that there was another world. The woman touched the Christ whom no one else had touched. Even though others pressed against Him, the Lord ignored them all. The touching of others did not bring about anything, but this woman's touch brought about something.</p><p>Today the Christians who are pressing the Lord will not be saved. Only those who are touching Him in a real way will be saved. Whether or not you have someone to give messages is not the main thing. Today many people who give messages are merely causing people to press against the Lord. What we need are those who are willing to pay a serious price.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 26, 1948, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S SALVATION AND DEMANDS BEING<br />THE SAME TODAY AS AT THE BEGINNING</h2><p>I believe that God is going to do great things today, and I believe that God has done something great already. God has given us a great salvation, a thorough salvation. In the first century God saved men. Today He is doing the same thing. The extent to which God saved men in the first century is the extent to which He is saving men today. God has not changed the gospel in the course of two thousand years of human history. There has been no change in the result and the demands of the gospel. We should not think that first century Christians were required to pay a great price, but that we do not need to pay the same price today. Those who follow the Lord today must pay the same price as those in the first century. At that time men had to forsake everything. The requirement has not changed. There is, of course, a difference between putting a lamp under a bushel and putting it on the lampstand, but the lamp itself has not changed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEGRADATION AND<br />THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>During the past two thousand years, the gospel has not changed. On the very day that the church was produced, God saw this new creation and considered that it was good. This is like God considering everything as good in Genesis after He created everything in six days. After some time, the situation changed. Although the situation changed, the beauty of the original creation remains the same. The beauty of the church on the first day at Pentecost was comparable to the beauty of Eve on the day of her creation. However, the church gradually changed. It changed from Ephesus to Sardis. At the time of Martin Luther, God began to take the way of recovery step by step. For the past four hundred years, God did some recovery work every fifty years. During the past one hundred years, His work has been especially strong. It seems as if the last few decades have seen the peak of recovery. There has never been a time when the church has been as rich as it is now.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY TESTIMONY BEING GOD'S FINAL RECOVERY</h2><p>We believe that God is recovering the most difficult thing today. What worries us the most today is the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. It seems as though we do not have to worry about the fulfillment of John 3:16. We are not afraid that it will not be fulfilled, and we are not worried. Suppose someone says that he has believed and asks what he should do if he still has not received eternal life. He has believed, yet he has not seen any result. What should he do? We are not worried about this. I have read the New Testament more than two hundred times. I am not worried about any other passage. I have even read Revelation a few hundred times. I am not worried about that book either. However, I am worried about Ephesians 4. I am concerned about how this passage of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.</p><p>Ephesians 4 says that the work of the ministry is to arrive at the oneness of the faith. The church is the Body of Christ, and it builds itself up in love. We are not concerned about things like the new heaven, the new earth, and the lake of fire. But when I lie on my bed, I am always apprehensive about the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. I have studied the Bible, and I have prayed, but I still do not have the assurance that the condition in Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled in the church today. Among God's children today, there is much confusion, and there are all kinds of divisions. When will we be one? Today there are all kinds of ministries; the situation is very complicated. How can this chapter be recovered?</p><p>Yet, brothers and sisters, we believe that there will be a day when God's recovery will reach the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. God is doing a recovery work everywhere. The ultimate work among all these works may very well be the recovery of the Body testimony. God's leading today is to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to the condition at the beginning.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BUILT<br />UPON THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>First Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 show us that in God's arrangement or plan, there is no such thing as a pastor monopolizing the service of the whole Body. Neither is there such a thing as a group of brothers and sisters serving while another group of brothers and sisters is being served. What we see in the Bible is the whole Body being a priesthood. The church is comprised of priests. God's intention was for the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests. But in actuality, not everyone was a priest. The situation among the local churches today is a little bit better. The brothers and sisters have the liberty to pray, to sing, to preach, and to take up responsibilities. But we have to realize that this is still not the church. The church is built upon the universal priesthood of the whole Body. The church is not built upon a few brothers and sisters. If the priesthood is not universal, we have Roman Catholicism. If the priesthood is universal, we have the church. We have to see that service to God is not a matter of three or five people serving, or thirty or fifty people serving. Our service to God today must be entirely different. In order to serve God today, everyone has to rise up to do the work.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT THE SERVICE OF THE MINISTERS,<br />BUT THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>When we were in Foochow, we noted the fact that in the past century, God raised up many spiritual giants, and that all of them were outstanding people. From 1820 until now, many spiritual giants have been raised up. Yet strangely, among us today we see very few spiritual giants. It seems as if the spiritual giants are all gone. Today we do not see the work of gospel preaching being done through the so-called great evangelists, men like Charles Finney and Stanley. It is not easy to find giants like these anymore. It seems as if God is taking a different way today. Today is the day of the service of the church, not the service of the ministers. It is no longer a matter of individuals preaching the gospel, but a matter of the church preaching the gospel. Previously, we had to invite famous and eloquent speakers to come to preach the gospel, and we had to use much propaganda. But today the church is coordinating together to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT INDIVIDUALS PREACHING THE GOSPEL,<br />BUT THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Take the case of Foochow. Recently, when the brothers were preaching the gospel, we had some brothers giving messages on the platform, but there were no advertisements and no famous speakers. One brother who had been saved for only two or three years was doing the preaching, and all the other brothers and sisters went out to invite friends. Twenty to fifty brothers and sisters could bring in four or five hundred people, and four or five hundred people could bring in a few thousand. Before the speaker stood up, two or three hundred people were saved already. Those brothers and sisters who brought their friends along with them knew if the friends sitting next to them were saved or not. The speaker on the platform could be deceived, but the brothers and sisters were clear about the condition of their friends. They could say that this one who stood up was genuine, and that one who stood up was not genuine. After the meeting they helped their gospel friends become clearer concerning the gospel. They helped them write down their names, showed them the direction to the meeting halls, and visited those who expressed their willingness to believe in the Lord.</p><p>Within one month in Foochow, almost a thousand people were saved. Today some people are still opposing, and this is why our work is still not that strong. If there is no frustration, I believe that all of Foochow can be taken over by us. Today the church is not a few special brothers rising up to preach the gospel; it is the whole church rising up to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE CHURCH INVOLVED<br />IN THE CARE OF THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2><p>Concerning the perfecting of the new believers, we also have to do it as a Body. Previously, whenever the number of saved ones increased, we faced problems. Today, as soon as a person is saved, he has to be perfected. This kind of perfecting is a kind of spiritual education. There is a big difference between those believers who have received the proper education and those who have not received the proper education. In Foochow over twenty brothers and sisters are devoted to the work of caring for the new believers. We have divided up all the streets in the city, and we have assigned definite brothers to take care of every district. The whole city of Foochow is divided into five districts, and all the brothers and sisters are charged with the responsibility of taking care of these districts. The older brothers and sisters who cannot move around freely stay behind to count the attendance. When someone is absent, they inform the brothers who are responsible for the visitation work. These visiting brothers and sisters will look up the absent one and conduct make-up lessons with him. If he has not come to the meeting, the brothers go to his home and repeat the same thing to him. An absent one may end up saying that it is too much of an imposition on the brothers, and that rather than having them come to his home, he would go to the meetings. Although we cannot say that the new believers are advanced in any kind of extraordinary way, we can say that they are more advanced than the old ones. This is the church building itself up, or perfecting itself, in love.</p><p>Therefore, the question is whether or not we have seen the church. The service of three or five people is not the church. Only the service of all the brothers and sisters is the church. Perhaps a group of brothers and sisters spend some money to hire a pastor and ask the pastor to do everything for them. They may even still love one another. You may say that there is very little difference, but I say that there is a big difference. It is the difference between the Body working and one individual working. There is also a difference between a minister working and every brother and sister working.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR THE WHOLE BODY TO RISE UP TO SERVE</h2><h2 class="head2">All the One-talented Ones Being Put to Use</h2><p>Formerly, we had new believers who were zealous to serve. But as soon as human zeal came in, the flesh also came in, and as soon as the flesh was stopped, the service also stopped. If we allow such people to serve, the church will be brought into confusion. But if we do not allow such people to serve, the church will become silent. If we put down a person's flesh, his spirit will be put down as well. This was a problem for the co-workers, and this is the reason we did not find the way in the past. This is the reason that authority needs to be recovered in the church. On the one hand, all the one-talented ones have to rise up. On the other hand, the church has to exercise its authority to deal with the flesh.</p><p>Today men always wait for ones with Paul's five talents to come along. But we may have to wait a hundred years before God will give us a great gift or a great ministry. We may have to wait decades before a teacher is raised up. The way today is the way of the whole Body serving. Although the one-talented ones are not worth much, they equal a five-talented one when a few of them are put together. As soon as a person is saved, he has at least one talent. No one has less than one talent. In the church one cannot find anyone who does not have at least one talent, unless, of course, such a one has buried his talent. Today the building up of the church hinges on the building up of the one-talented ones. If some five-talented ones are raised up, we praise the Lord for it. In terms of function and result in the work, the great gifts are surely good when they are coordinated together. It is good to have the help of the five-talented ones and the two-talented ones. But what we need today is for the one-talented ones to rise up. The way to deal with the flesh is by the authority. But at the same time, the one-talented ones have to rise up. Only this will afford the church a way to go on, and only then will there be works for the church to do.</p><h2 class="head2">Recovering the Authority of the Church<br />to Deal with the Flesh</h2><p>In serving the Lord, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross on the one hand. Once the Holy Spirit operates, the cross will function within a person's heart. The authority of the church needs to be recovered on the other hand. This deals with the flesh and deals with those who will not take the cross. In order for the work of the church to be recovered, there is first the need for the recovery of one-talented ones. In order to recover the work of the church, there must also be the recovery of the authority of the church. It is not enough just to recover the one-talented ones, and it is not enough just to recover the authority of the church. If all the one-talented ones rise up, we will be able to take over China in a short time. Who can withstand the mobilization of all the one-talented ones? If God will do this work among us, we will see an unprecedented work of salvation among us.</p><p>At the same time, the brothers and sisters have to learn to listen to others. If they do not listen, the church will fall into confusion. Naturally, the young and the new believers have many things that they do not know. The more advanced and mature brothers and sisters should exhort them to listen to others. We are people with a very small capacity. According to our disposition, we do things when we feel like doing them, and we go home and sleep when we do not feel like doing them. However, in the Body today, whether we like it or not, we have to do what we should do. Even if we have to cry with tears or sacrifice ourselves, we still have to do it.</p><p>Co-workers, brothers, we have to receive something from the Lord. We cannot let anyone slip by. We cannot be so foolish in our work as to be unable even to tell the real believers from the false ones. We cannot leave a person alone for three to five months after baptism without rendering the proper care to him. We are our brothers' keepers. Those who do not act as their brothers' keepers are those who murder their brothers (Gen. 4:8-9).</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Handing Over Himself,<br />Everyone Working, <br />and Everyone Submitting to Authority</h2><p>If we do these things, a church according to Pentecost will soon appear. If everyone hands himself over, if everyone is learning and working, and if everyone offers up his material riches and is obedient, we will have the proper coordination. I hope to see this situation not only in one or two places, but throughout the entire nation.</p><p>During the war we had over four hundred co-workers among us. If the material supply had been adequate, we could have increased the number to a thousand. Whether in the east or in the west, most of the ones who are actually doing some kind of work are our brothers and sisters. In Chekiang there are over ninety co-workers. In the province of Fukien alone, we see God's blessings everywhere.</p><p>The foolish ones only see what they have in their hands; they do not have eyes for the whole earth. Today we have to enlarge our view. In China today there are close to one thousand churches. But what is that to the Lord? We need tens of thousands of churches.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Needing the Training</h2><p>All the brothers and sisters in the church have to be trained. What we need today is not theology, but education in the things of God. When a local church is young, there is no way for the brothers and sisters to serve. But when a church is strong and rich, there will be much work. By that time, there will still be a shortage of manpower, even if all the young saints put themselves into the work.</p><h2 class="head2">Migration</h2><p>After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out. The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem. In reading the Bible many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth. If that were the case, how could the twelve disciples travel through the whole earth? The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles remained in Jerusalem and that Samaria was taken by Philip. Peter's visit to Samaria was a temporary one. It would have been wrong for him to settle in Samaria. The gospel work is a relay race; it is not done by one man alone. Today the co-workers should remain in their own Jerusalems. After they gain some people, they should send them out. If they do not send out people, persecutions will come and difficulties will arise. In order for the gospel to go out, there is the need for migration. The apostles should remain in Jerusalem and work there, and all the brothers and sisters should receive training from the church. At the same time, the church should care for the poor, the unbelievers, and the new believers; it should learn how to deal with them and how to gain them. After they are perfected, they should be sent out. This kind of coordination will be effective; it will spread to all the places. Not only do the apostles have to preach the gospel; all the brothers and sisters have to preach the gospel. Philip was not specially ordained to be an evangelist, just as Stephen was not specially ordained to be a martyr. We think that only special brothers can do special works. Yet, Philip was simply one of those who served tables. We have to realize that Samaria was taken over by such a table-server. Coordination requires that everyone be consecrated and that everyone offer up what he has.</p><p>Perhaps many will say, "I do not have the eloquence. I do not know how to preach the gospel.'' You have to start learning today. If you preach well, you have to preach. If you do not preach well, you still have to preach. Perhaps when you preach the first time, the sinners will not be saved. But when you preach the second time, they will be saved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Working Saints Offering Up<br />Their Material Riches</h2><p>Whoever wants to be a Sunday-goer or a spectator can continue to be a pew-member. But in the church, everyone has to offer himself up. To the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs, I have to say that you are no longer working for money. If a person does not offer up his riches, his consecration is invisible and intangible. No one can tell when he has taken back such a kind of consecration. The Bible says that the disciples laid everything at the feet of the apostles (Acts 4:35).</p><h2 class="head1">ALL MYSTICAL THINGS<br />BECOMING TANGIBLE AND PRACTICABLE</h2><p>Today every mystical thing has to become practicable. For example, Christ says that we have to humble ourselves and love others. Is this good? Yes, it is good. But the Lord's Word does not stop here; He charges us to wash each other's feet. Today no one would admit that he is proud. Neither would anyone put up a sign and say that he is humble. Yet whether or not you are humble depends on whether you have washed each other's feet. All the mystical things have to become tangible before they can become reliable.</p><p>The book of James says that if there are poor brothers among us, and we love them, we cannot merely lift our hands and say, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled'' (2:16). Mystical love is eternal; yet it is useless as far as practical matters are concerned. It is more practical to give the poor brother a bowl of rice.</p><p>If a brother offends me, I have to forgive him. But if this forgiveness remains mystical, I can forgive him fifty or a hundred times, and others will still not realize it. This kind of forgiveness must be transformed into a kind of tangible dealing.</p><p>The same is true about withstanding Satan. If you withstand Satan in an inward way, you do not know whether or not the withstanding works. But if you say a few words, Satan will go away.</p><p>The same is true with baptism. Once a person believes, he needs to be baptized. Perhaps some will think that it is too quick to baptize a person right after he believes. But this is wrong. Believing with the heart is something that is invisible. One must have the visible baptism before the matter is settled. Believing with the heart is mystical; being baptized in the body is tangible.</p><p>The same is true with consecration. A mystical consecration is not solid. Many consecrations remain mystical. Many say to the Lord, "I consecrate everything.'' But the Gospel of Luke shows us that Zaccheus' consecration was very concrete. He offered up his possessions (19:8). The Lord's command to him was also very concrete. During the past one hundred years, the church has received many mystical consecrations. But the consecrations at the time of the early apostles were tangible. At that time, when a man handed himself over, everything was settled. Every brother and sister should hand over himself or herself; everyone should submit to the authority of the church and be coordinated together with other brothers and sisters. Brother Witness said it well: When the church is advancing and the material offering falls behind, it is the fault of the brothers and sisters; however, if the material offering is adequate, yet the gospel falls behind, it is the fault of the co-workers. The brothers and sisters who participate in the spiritual services have to be coordinated, and the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should also be coordinated. Some sisters wanted to offer up something, but I declined their offerings, because they had not offered up themselves yet. First Corinthians tells us that God first receives us, then ours. The person has to be given first, before possessions and time can be given.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING AFTER ABSOLUTE ONES</h2><p>The coordination that we are speaking of today is one that costs the co-workers' their lives. It is one that also costs the other brothers' and sisters' their lives. All the brothers and sisters must have the Lord as their center, and they have to offer up everything for the gospel and for the service. We do not consider being a Christian as our second profession. Some are professing Christians, but we should be "professional'' Christians. Christ should be our first profession. All the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should offer up all their time. The Lord demands that we deny ourselves for the sake of loving Him. The Lord's demand is the same today as it was in the first century. In God's Word there is no place for halfway ones; there are only absolute ones.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi: May the Lord forbid that tonight's words be merely mysterious words in our heart. May they be transformed to outward realities. May they not be merely notions, but realities. May they not be merely doctrines, but life. May they not be something that is nice to hear, but something that is good to see. May we not have fragmentary services, but complete services. May we not only have a consecration of the heart and the mouth, but a consecration of the hands and the feet. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">DELIVERANCE FROM MAMMON<br />AND MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 27, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">DELIVERED FROM MAMMON TO SERVE GOD</h2><p>The Bible assigns mammon a very important position. Mammon stands in opposition to God. Today more people are gained by mammon than those gained by God. Of a hundred people, perhaps eighty are gained by mammon. Of the remaining twenty, eighteen to nineteen serve both God and mammon. It is difficult to find one in a hundred who truly serves God. Mammon gains more souls than God does.</p><h2 class="head2">Deliverance from Mammon Being<br />the Basic Qualification for One to Serve God</h2><p>Originally, we had no intention during this time to speak about mammon. We were going to look at the matter of the Body life. Later, the fellowship about the Body life led to a second problem. The first problem is individualism, and the second problem is mammon. Individualism frustrates man from serving God. Mammon also frustrates man from serving God. If a man serves mammon, not only will there be no service to God corporately, but individually he will not be able to serve God either. We can say that deliverance from mammon is the first and foremost condition for one to serve God. If a man is not delivered from mammon, he cannot serve God.</p><h2 class="head2">Money Being Satan's Means to Unify All Things</h2><p>All things are created by God. God is the unique source of all things; He is above all things. When men see all things, they should be moved to worship God. The human mind invented atheism, and it is obviously wrong. The heavens move men to know God. "All things'' are diverse and complicated. Satan wants to unify all things. There is no way to add up all things. For example, a chair and a table cannot be added together to make one unit. What is an adult plus a child plus a piece of luggage plus a bar of gold plus a piece of land? They do not add up to one unit. However, if all these things are converted into money, we can add them up. If all things cannot be unified, how can the businessmen do their accounting? With so many different units, how can one reckon their respective value? Money is the only means by which we can reckon all things. For example, a piece of land no longer becomes just a piece of land; it becomes money. Rice no longer becomes just rice; it becomes money. When we add together all things, we end up with a certain amount of money. Revelation 18 tells us that even the human soul can be reckoned with money. When a man sells his time to work for others, he is selling his soul. For example, when I hire a laborer, I agree ahead of time how much I will pay him for working eight hours. This is to buy the human soul with money. Money can buy us the human soul, and money can buy us all things. God created the earth, yet man divided it up into pieces and reckoned the value of every piece with money. If man could occupy the land on the moon, he would sell it for money also. Even for airplanes that fly over the earth, man charges people for access to the air space. Perhaps some people think that this is nothing unusual. But to us and to the Bible, this is very strange. In six days God created all things. Can we find out how much money "all things'' are worth? There are all sorts of things in all fashions and colors. Yet Satan has simplified these things and unified them under money. This is why money is called "the common goods'' in Chinese.</p><h2 class="head2">Satan Usurping Man's Worship through Money</h2><p>At the same time, money takes hold of all things. On the one end, God produced all things through creation. On the other end, Satan converted all things into money, thus unifying all things. If a man has money, he can buy anything. He can buy gold. He can even buy the whole of Shanghai or the whole of China. There is not one thing that money cannot buy. Mammon is opposed to God. This is the reason the Bible tells us not only that the love of money is a root of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10), but that covetousness and idolatry go together (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). Covetousness is the only idol. When one worships money, he is not worshipping money itself, but the created things behind the money. Because man wants goods, he spends the "common goods,'' that is, the money, to buy the particular goods. This means that man wants God's things and does not want God Himself. This is the reason that man either serves God or mammon. Those who have a heart for mammon can never love God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Only Way to Serve God Being<br />to Be Delivered from Mammon</h2><p>God's things come from God; this is grace. The things that come from God are not for sale. The sunlight is not metered, and there is no charge for it. But there is a charge for electric light. In order to get anything from Satan, man has to buy it. Even the carob pods of the prodigal son had to be bought. If a person truly wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from money. Once a person's thoughts are turned to money, he cannot serve God. It is wrong for a man to view all things from the side of money; he should view all things from the side of God.</p><h2 class="head1">MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY</h2><p>Another thing which we must see is the relationship between ministry and authority. The eyes have the ministry of the eyes; they control the seeing function. In order for any member in the body to see, it has to rely on the ministry of the eyes. The meaning of coordination is that we give to others what we have, and others give to us what they have. The first condition to coordination is that we accept our own limitation. We have to acknowledge that we are only a member, and that we are not the Body. If we were capable in everything, then we would be the whole Body, and we would not need coordination any longer. However, as long as we are only a member, we cannot think that we have everything. The one-talented ones cannot pretend to be rich. Even if the eyes are important, they cannot replace the ears. One can see colors only with the eyes, and one can hear sounds only with the ears. Perhaps I can only speak, not walk. In that case, someone will have to do the walking. If we see this, we will realize that what one individual can do is actually very limited.</p><p>During these days the Lord has shown us that too few brothers and sisters know what real coordination is. A brother said once, "I do not think that this thing should be done this way.'' I said to him, "Who is asking you to think?'' If you are an ear, you do not have to say, "I think this matter should be done this way.'' If the eyes see that something is white, then it is white. There is no need for the ear to think about whether it is white.</p><p>The sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers. Christ says that He does not speak from Himself (John 12:49). The word from is ek in the original language. It means "out from.'' This means that the Son can speak nothing out from Himself. In other words Christ's head is covered before God. Today the church also has its head covered before Christ. The fact of the covering is demonstrated through the sisters' covering of their heads. Whenever we are in the coordination of the Body, all our heads have to be removed. For many to think about what to do and to express the opinions that they have is quite inappropriate. Someone asked me once, "If I cannot say amen to a certain thing, what should I do?'' The Bible never says that a servant of God should do something "when he feels an amen to do it,'' and should not do something "when he does not feel an amen to do it.'' Man's head needs to be cut off. When some brothers and sisters talk to me, I have the feeling that my head should be cut off. Only the unique Head is qualified to think. Today man's mind is full of the thought of being the head. A person has to learn to reject proposals and opinions.</p><p>God has reserved for Himself teachers who can make decisions concerning the interpretation of the Bible and judgments on the Scriptures. The reason that there are so many sects and strange doctrines is that everyone wants to be a teacher. However, not everyone is a teacher in reality. It is useless for the ear to say that something is white. Whether or not a thing is white is not determined by what the ear says, but by what the eyes see. Today there are many heresies that have developed from the church because of this very reason.</p><p>There is one thing that is very strange in 1 Corinthians 12: Although the eyes and the ears are on the head, they are not the head. In the body the controlling organ is the head, whereas the working organs are the members. The organ that actually sees is not the eyes, but the optical nerves within the head. Outwardly speaking, the whole body moves by the seeing of the eyes. Actually it moves by the head. Even if you are a great gift or a strong member, you are useless if you are not in coordination, and if you are not the eyes, you surely need coordination all the more. Today we need to see our own limitation.</p><p>There are many things that do not require our consideration. Once we see the limitation of the members, the matter of authority will be settled. If we are at odds with the members appointed by God, we are at odds with the Head. If we are omnipotent and omniscient, we will not need any coordination. In the church we are not afraid of the seemingly foolish ones who know nothing; we are only afraid of those who know everything and who can do everything. In coordination we should not be the head. Rather, we should learn to listen and not have too many of our own thoughts.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE ASCERTAINING OF MINISTRY</h2><p>Witness Lee: How does a person know what kind of ministry he has?</p><p>Watchman Nee: It is better that he does not know. Whether or not one has a ministry is up to the Head to know; it is not up to you to know. This is the reason we have to accept the judgment of the whole Body. Only the knowledge of the Body is reliable. Whether we think we have a ministry or not does not count.</p><p>It is useless for a brother or a sister to tell others in the meeting that he or she has a ministry. If you have a ministry, you have it, and it will be manifested through your exercising if it. Concerning the ascertaining of ministry, we have to realize that the judgment of the whole Body is more accurate than the judgment of an individual.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING PURSUING THE GIFTS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Ministry Being Constituted<br />of the Death of Jesus,<br />whereas the Gifts Being Bestowed upon Us<br />Outwardly by the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: What kind of attitude should we take concerning the pursuit of the gifts?</p><p>Watchman Nee: First and Second Corinthians tell us the difference between gifts and ministry. First Corinthians is on gifts, whereas 2 Corinthians is on ministry. The basis of ministry is the death and life of Christ. A gift is merely a power that the Holy Spirit bestows outside of us. The word death in 2 Corinthians 4 is a special word in the original language. There is more than one word for death in Greek. One of them means the opposite of life. It is used to describe a person as being dead, as opposed to being alive. This is the word that is commonly used. Another word means a kind of killing. It is used in the sense of killing a person, as opposed to begetting a person. The death in 2 Corinthians 4 has the sense of killing in the Greek language. Hence, it can be translated as the killing or the slaying of Jesus. While I was in London, I told the Western brothers and sisters that we can use a new word, deathize, for death in 2 Corinthians 4. This death is a death that kills us. What this means is that the positive death of Jesus is being wrought into us. It refers to the death which issues from Jesus and which causes us to die. A ministry of life comes from God and is produced through repeated dealings. Spiritual gifts, however, are but elementary matters in the church. What the Lord cares for today is that we serve the church with the ministry, and not with the gifts.</p><h2 class="head2">The Church Needing Life Ministry<br />More Than Spiritual Gifts</h2><p>As soon as a brother stands up to speak, one can tell immediately whether he is a brother with a gift or a brother with a ministry. In Southeast Asia men cut the rubber tree with a knife. The life of the tree flows out through the scar of the knife-wound. This is a picture of one who serves with a ministry. When a man passes through fiery trials, he can give life to others. This is very different from merely giving gifts to others. In order to have a strong church, we need the ministry of life, not gifts. When one walks into an immature church, there may be much activity, but there is not much life. However, we may see a brother who is not eloquent; we may even be concerned for him and wonder if we should do his job for him. Yet with him, there is the ministry. What is manifested in him is not the gifts. When a church is mature, many ministries will be produced, and there will be much life supply. Every brother should learn to touch the difference between gift and ministry. The church needs more ministries to be raised up. An immature church requires the presence of gifted brothers. But we cannot allow such a situation to go on forever. Gifts are temporary, whereas ministries last forever.</p><h2 class="head2">Gifts Being What One Uses,<br />whereas Ministry Being the Person Himself</h2><p>Brother Yu: The life of Christ is His deposit within the believers. This life is a real entity from Christ. It is a reality from heaven. A gift is only a thing; one can borrow it and use it for a while, but the user may not know what it is. It is like Balaam's donkey speaking human words; one cannot say that the donkey has become human because of this. Those who exercise gifts are like children speaking grown-up words. God has raised up some people with a ministry. On the one hand, they have to have the gifts, because they otherwise could not do the work of perfecting. On the other hand, those who speak merely according to their gifts are entirely different from those who speak according to a ministry that is produced in the course of twenty years or more. Some say, "If others can speak, why can I not speak?'' The problem is that even though a child can speak grown-up words, he does not become a grown-up as a consequence. This is like the donkey speaking human words; it does not mean that the donkey can consider itself a human being just because it speaks human words. Outwardly, the speaking of those with gifts and the speaking of those with a ministry are the same. But inwardly, they are different.</p><p>When a church is strong, the spirit of the saints is clear. Although there may not be many outward activities, men will learn the proper lessons before the Lord. When a church is young, there may be gifts, but there will not be the ministry. If we know God, we will see that a person may say something, but this does not mean that he is what he says. Some gifted ones fall much faster and easier than those who have no gifts.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE EXERCISE OF<br />AUTHORITY IN THE BODY<br />AND THE BODY-CONSCIOUSNESS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 28, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">Being Restricted in Our Speaking</h2><p>A man learns restriction first through his speaking. It is very difficult for a man to control his tongue. A tongue that is under control only dares to speak words of the instructed (Isa. 50:4). The first thing we have to see is that a person who is rebellious in his speaking is one who has given himself away.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Speaking Reviling Words</h2><p>When I was in London, I met a couple who would not submit to the responsible brothers. The husband was a good man, and the wife was also a good sister. The only trouble was that they were too talkative. They testified that whenever they spoke contradicting words, their spirit became a contradicting spirit. We have to see that our spirit comes out as soon as our words come out. Both 2 Peter and Jude speak of the matter of reviling. Reviling is done through our speaking. If we are not careful and we revile the brothers ahead of us, the oneness of the church will be damaged.</p><h2 class="head3">Withstanding Reviling Words</h2><p>Those who take in reviling words bear the same responsibility as those who speak reviling words. It is one thing for a person to dump trash on others. It is another thing for a person to receive trash from others. One of the reasons the church is divided and damaged is that there are reviling words. In order for the church to maintain the oneness, the brothers and sisters have to withstand reviling words.</p><h2 class="head3">The Example of Michael</h2><p>Michael was an archangel. In the beginning he was under Satan. Although Satan fell, Michael did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him even when contending over the body of Moses, which was probably left on the Mount of Transfiguration. Michael could not revile Satan. He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you'' (Jude 9). He had to invoke a higher authority to rebuke Satan. From this we see the importance of our words.</p><h2 class="head3">Reviling Words Damaging the Body</h2><p>Some people's tongues are "waxed''; they are very cunning. This kind of person does not know or understand the Body. They unconsciously damage the Body with their words. It is bad enough for a man to have a wound. But if one rubs sand on the wound, the hurt will be greater. The same is true when one speaks reviling words. If a man's tongue is not under control, all other kinds of control are useless (James 3:2). Man's tongue is the most cunning of all things. A double-tongued person will soon find that he has no one he can perfect; he will turn away every possible person he can perfect. If you are an inquisitive person and one with an itching ear, you want others to talk to you and to entertain you. But those who have learned the lessons should rebuke you to your face. One need not go on speaking when he is in front of an inquisitive person; his words should stop right there.</p><h2 class="head3">The Need to Know the Body</h2><p>The consciousness of sin comes from knowing God. In the same way, the consciousness of reviling words comes from the knowledge of the Body. Reviling words are opposed to the testimony of the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning Not to Be the Head</h2><h2 class="head3">Submitting to the Authority of the Head,<br />and Being the Authority One to Another</h2><p>The head manifests itself as the head by its ideas and proposals. The meaning of submitting to the authority of the Head is that one does not need to make many proposals and will not have many ideas of his own. A Christian who lives in the Body is a very simple person.</p><p>There is a basic difference between a Protestant's understanding of the Bible and a Catholic's understanding of the Bible. The Catholics think that the Pope is the only one who can make decisions on the interpretation of the Bible and that no ordinary person can interpret the Bible. The Pope's decision is the only decision. From this doctrine many kinds of idolatry have developed, including the worship of Mary. Protestantism is more advanced than Catholicism. It claims that there are as many popes as there are Christians, and that everyone can read and interpret the Bible. If we have the light, we will see that both of these views are wrong. In the Body the Lord has arranged for certain members to have the authority to make judgments on the interpretation of the Scriptures. Hence, we should not try to be a pope in haste.</p><p>For example, the Lord has raised up some brothers among us to help us concerning the way of life. If any of the brothers have any question concerning the way of life, they can go to these brothers to seek for help. In the Body there is not just one brother, but many brothers who can supply life in many aspects. If we want to receive help from them, we have to realize that they have the ministry and that they have the authority. We have to submit ourselves to their authority. This authority is given to them by the Head. If any member of my body argues with my mouth or eyes, it is arguing with the head who has established those ministries. If a member does not submit to the function of these members, it is not submitting to the head. A rebellious person exposes his rebellion first through many rash words and then through his rationalization. The simpler we are, the more we can be one with others. This does not mean that when we submit to others, we do not have a ministry any longer. In the Body we are authorities one to another.</p><h2 class="head3">Ministry Being Authority</h2><p>Ministry is authority. When the Lord gives a ministry to a person, He is giving authority to that person. Many people worry about many problems, but as a member we have to learn to remove our own heads. This is the meaning of the sisters' covering of their heads. Head covering means that only the Lord is the Head. This does not mean that the responsible brothers can make any proposal they want. A person who has been dealt with is one who does not like to interfere with others' affairs. Only after we become a person who has no interest in interfering with others' affairs can we be the authority; only then can we bear responsibility before God, and only then can we manage the affairs of the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ARE IN AUTHORITY<br />NOT INTERFERING WITH OTHERS</h2><p>God never interferes with man, nor does He ever force man to do anything. The garden of Eden was not fenced with barbed wire, and hell does not have any fences either. If a man wants to go to hell, he can go in easily. All roads lead to hell. In the twentieth century man has invented the electric fence and supplied twenty or sixty volts of electricity to these fences. But our God never interferes with man, nor does He force man to do anything. All those who by nature like to meddle with others' affairs must be dealt with. Those who by nature like to control others can never be the authority. Those who are the authorities should let others know that they do not like to control others. They should speak only because they have received authority from the Head. A man who has been taught and who has learned to be an authority will not answer questions in a light way.</p><h2 class="head1">ONLY THOSE HAVING BEEN DEALT WITH BY THE LORD<br />AND WHO KNOW THE LORD'S MIND<br />BEING ABLE TO BE THE AUTHORITY</h2><p>The deepest chapter in the New Testament concerning man's experience is 1 Corinthians 7. There Paul said that he did not have a commandment from the Lord. Yet up to a certain point, he said that he thought he had the Spirit of God (v. 40). Paul said that he gave the brothers his own opinion. It was as if he was saying that he had followed the Lord for twelve years, and that according to him the matter should be taken care of in such and such a way. In the end he said that in his spirit he felt that he had the Spirit of God. Because he had been dealt with by the Lord in many things, he could speak according to the principle by which he had been dealt with. He had followed the Lord for so many years and had learned so much. He was brought to the point that he could say that he knew the Lord's heart.</p><p>Abraham and Enoch walked with God. That is why they knew God's way. God did not have to tell them anything; they simply knew God's heart. It is a strange thing for a man to follow the Lord many years and yet not know the pace the Lord is taking, the direction He is turning, or the method He is using. A person who knows God's heart knows the Lord's mind even before He makes things manifest.</p><p>We need to be a person who has been taught by God and who is under control. Only those who do not speak carelessly or express their opinions carelessly can hope to be used by God. Only these ones can represent the Head. Only such people can lead the brothers and sisters on in the way ahead of them. God will never entrust authority to those who by nature like to criticize. In order for a man to submit, his head must first be cut off. If you are a person with your head removed, you immediately sense when others' heads have asserted themselves. You feel their assertion of headship like an electric shock. Once you touch them, you realize that they have asserted their headship, and that in certain matters they have rebelled. You know it because you have been judged in this matter already. This is why you can feel it when similar cases come up. If a brother has been dealt with in these two things, that is, in the matter of speaking and in learning not to assume headship, there is no difficulty in the exercise of authority. Those who cause problems in these two matters do not know what the Body is.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2><p>Witness Lee: In our contact with the brothers and sisters, we will become a movement if we pay too much attention to the outward methods. We have not spent enough time on the matter of life and revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE</h2><p>Watchman Nee: In French history there were certain persons who were called pretenders to the throne. The throne did not belong to such ones. Yet they claimed to have it. It is somewhat like the last Chinese Emperor Pu-yi, who lost his empire but continued to proclaim himself to be the emperor.</p><p>Today many people claim that they are the church or that they are the authority. Whether in the Roman Catholic Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, or the Methodist Church, those who claim to be the church or claim to have the authority are "pretenders to the throne.'' The Roman Catholic Church says that Peter was the first pope, and that all subsequent popes are the representatives of Christ. Today if we are a little more clever and a little less clear about the boundary line, we will fall into their error and become a pretender to the throne also.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY-CONSCIOUSNESS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Body-Consciousness&mdash;<br />Submitting to the Authority of the Head<br />and Fellowshipping with the Body</h2><p>What is the church? Outwardly speaking, the church is local. We covered this in the co-workers' meetings in 1937. But what is the content and the life of the church? If a church does not stand on the ground of the local church, it is not a church. If a local church would submit to the authority of the Head, it is spontaneously a church. In the church we are members one of another. The meaning of being members one of another is that no one keeps something back for himself. My heart is joined to all the children of God, and it is related to all the members. As members, our experience of coming into the consciousness of the Body is just as definite as our individual experience of touching the Head. The Body has a Body consciousness. This consciousness causes a member to submit to the authority of the Head and causes it to also open up itself to the Body and have fellowship with the Body. This is what we call Body-consciousness.</p><p>I will use a somewhat inadequate illustration. When a man travels overseas, he may be a foreigner in another land, but he is still under the headship of his own country. A Chinese who loves China and who lives in a foreign land may tell others that he is China; he does not say that he is a Chinese. Some foreign students are ashamed to be known as a Chinese; they often say negative things to foreigners about China. Some political fugitives are even worse; they are actively damaging China. But those who truly love China have a special consciousness about China. They can say that they are China.</p><h2 class="head2">The Body Testimony&mdash;<br />Taking the Head as the Authority<br />and Being One with All the Saints</h2><p>A person who has the Body-consciousness can say that he is the Body. If you say that you are the Body yet do not submit to the authority of the Head, what you say is false. On the contrary, if you are in the Body, you will not just be a drop of water, you will be mingled with the sea. Therefore, you can say that you are the sea.</p><p>Outwardly speaking, the church has the locality as its boundary. But as far as its content, it takes the Head as its authority. Here all the saints are one in Christ. The local church is not just a local church as such. Within the local church, there is the testimony of the Body, and in this church everyone holds on to the Head.</p><p>When we fellowship with all the children of God, we will not criticize others easily. The basic issue is that we have to pray to God to create a Body-consciousness within us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way to Have the Body-Consciousness&mdash;<br />Dealing with Individualism</h2><p>How do we turn from a situation that is without a Body- consciousness to one that is with a Body-consciousness? First, we have to deal with our individualism. For everything, we have to know the positive side as well as the negative side. It is not enough to merely know the positive side; we need to know the negative side as well. If we do not know both sides, we will not be able to learn the proper lessons. For example, the opposite side of sins is forgiveness, and the opposite side of justification is ungodliness. The opposite side of salvation is the world. If a man wants to understand forgiveness, he must understand sins. If a man wants to be justified, he has to be delivered from ungodliness. If a man wants to be saved, he must know the world. The Bible seldom says that a man is delivered from hell. Most of the time, it says that a man is delivered from the world. Another example is sanctification. The opposite of sanctification is being common. The word holy is hagios in the original language, and it means to be separated. The opposite of separation is to be common. All the truths in the Bible are in pairs. If we mismatch these pairs, we will be confused.</p><p>The opposite of the Body is individualism. Hence, if we want to see the Body, we must first see the negative side of the Body, which is individualism. A man must first deal with his self before he can see the Body. Many people deal with the matter of loving the Lord and of obedience. But the more they deal with them, the more they build up the self, their own righteousness, their goodness, and their holiness. This makes it even harder for them to be mingled with others and to follow the footsteps of the flock.</p><p>Individualism is the deepest thing that is hidden in a person. A man needs to be touched by God to such an extent that everything with him is dealt with. Today man only sees the personal sanctification of the Keswick movement. Why do we not speak of corporate sanctification? The sanctification in Hebrews 12 is a corporate sanctification. Today many people talk about personal faith. Why do we not speak of corporate faith? In the Bible, when it says "the faith,'' it means the saving truth, whereas "faith'' without the article refers to the act of believing. "The faith'' refers to the corporate faith of the whole church. Today man refuses to pay attention to corporate faith and corporate sanctification because he has not seen that he has very little.</p><h2 class="head2">On Seeing the Body</h2><p>A piece of glass may hold a little bit of water, but it can never hold the equivalent of a cup of water. Every Christian has received some grace, but individual Christians are not the whole. Even if they receive much grace, they can only be considered big pieces of glass. They are still two-dimensional; they are not three-dimensional. Today individuals have to be set aside. What the Lord wants is not individual pieces of broken glass, but a whole cup. God's principle is for one to chase a thousand, and two to chase ten thousand (Deut. 32:30). Today the church is filled with individuals. But wherever there are two persons who are one, they can drive out ten thousand, eight thousand of which they gain as extra profit. God wants to see the church preaching the gospel, the church teaching the truth, and the church making the money. Everything is placed in the church. Seeing the Body is one kind of salvation. This salvation is stronger and richer than the first salvation that an individual receives. Once a person has been touched by the Lord, he can no longer say that he can be an individual Christian. We need to allow God to work in us. A man develops the Body-consciousness not through thinking or deduction. Once the self is dealt with, the Body- consciousness is manifested. On the one hand, you will see that you are the Body. On the other hand, you will see that you are also a member. When a man sees individualism as a sin, he will submit to God. Once a man sees the Body, nothing will be difficult. When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to love others. When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to live by faith or to receive answers to prayers. In the Lord's work, if a man has not seen the Body, he cannot do anything. Hence, many things today hinge on seeing the Body truth.</p><h2 class="head2">To Be Obedient, to Be Taught,<br />and to Not Assume Headship</h2><p>A person has a problem with Body-consciousness because he has a problem concerning individualism. In order for a brother to become submissive, first his own ideas must go. My hands have been listening to my head for forty-five years; they never express their own ideas. They always keep their place. This is why there is no problem with my body. If my heart tries to set up another head, my body will argue with itself from morning until night. To remove our individualism, we have to tear down our own head. We have to learn to speak as one who is taught, to think as one who is taught, and to act as one who is taught. Submission is the simplest thing there is. It is difficult for a person to submit alone. But when there are many people around, it will become easy to submit. In order to submit to one another, there is the need for everyone to be dealt with.</p><p>Coordination does not come through human thoughts and opinions. If our physical body can have such a wonderful coordination, how much more wonderful should the coordination in the Body of Christ be? We believe that when Christ's spiritual Body is coordinated together, what we see will be even better and more beautiful, and its result will far exceed what we think.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">VOLUNTARY POVERTY<br />AND SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 28, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:21-24</h1><h2 class="head1">VOLUNTARY POVERTY</h2><h2 class="head2">Deliverance from Mammon to Serve God</h2><p>Matthew 6:22 says, "If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light.'' In verse 24 the Lord then speaks of the matter of serving Him. In the matter of serving the Lord, a man has to be single. No one can serve both God and mammon. Verse 22 speaks of the eye being single, and verse 24 speaks of the service being single. Mammon is a serious thing. If a man wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from mammon. Those who are not delivered from mammon cannot serve God.</p><p>A single eye means an eye that is delivered from mammon. Only this kind of eye will enable one to see the truth. The truth is absolute; it has nothing to do with man. If a man does not know God, it is because his eyes are defiled and impure. In order for a man to know God, he must have eyes that are delivered from any defilements. An impure person cannot see the truth. In the eyes of a defiled person, everything is defiled. Such persons cannot see God.</p><h2 class="head2">Voluntary Poverty<br />as a Result of the Lord's Salvation</h2><p>A Christian should consider mammon as a menace, something that needs to be disposed of right away. He should drop it in the same way that he would drop a red-hot coal from his hand. A Christian's poverty should be voluntary. Some become poor through their environment. Others are poor because of their parents or other special circumstances. But there is a certain kind of people who are poor because they have met salvation. They have chosen to become poor. There is a big difference between this kind of poverty and all other kinds of poverty. This is like being a soldier in the army: Some are drafted, whereas others enlist voluntarily.</p><h2 class="head2">It Being Difficult for a Rich Man<br />to Enter God's Kingdom</h2><p>Why do we have to choose poverty? It is because the Bible says that it is difficult for a rich man to be saved. It is more difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle (Matt. 19:23-24). A rich man can enter the kingdom of God only with difficulty.</p><h2 class="head2">Mammon Being an Idol</h2><p>Mammon is an idol. Covetousness is the same as idolatry (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). If you worked in an office and others tried to pay you with an idol or a golden calf, would you take it? Of course, you would not take it. But today many people do not realize that mammon is the same as idols. It does not matter what kind of money it is; as long as it is mammon, it belongs to Caesar.</p><h2 class="head2">The Testimony of Voluntary Poverty</h2><p>During the time of the apostles, the disciples gave up everything to follow the Lord. In church history there were tens of thousands of Franciscans who chose to live in poverty. We are often too careful concerning this matter. We are afraid that we will become too much. Actually, there are too many times in our life that we have been too much already. If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration. The founder of the Moravian movement, Count Zinzendorf, was an educated person, and he offered up all his material possessions. The number of missionaries this group sent out ranks the highest among all missionary groups during the past few hundred years. The Brethren do not like to advertise themselves, but many among them also chose the way of voluntary poverty.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with Mammon to Take Care<br />of the Church's Need</h2><p>In the Old Testament, when Rachel left Laban, she took her images with her, and she was condemned (Gen. 31:32). Christians have to deal with mammon in the same way that they deal with idols. A Christian should not have idols in his house. In the same way, a Christian should not lay up for himself riches in his house. For God's children to lay up riches is the same as for them to touch idols. There are too many needs in the church. There are at least three needs. First, there is the need of the work. Second, there is the need of the poor brothers. Third, there is always the need of poor people. The Lord's Word says that the poor we have with us always (Matt. 26:11). We have to take care of the needs in these three areas.</p><h2 class="head2">Money Having to Go<br />before One Can Experience Deliverance</h2><p>Mammon is more serious than idols. When the church is strong, it will take the stand of voluntary poverty. In this way no false brothers will dare to come into the church, for once they come, they will have to sacrifice themselves. All those who come in through eloquence, intelligence, or wisdom will not be able to remain in the church. This will purify the church. When money goes out, a man is delivered. If you want to remain clean, you have to let your riches go.</p><p>In the Bible we can see the Lord's relationship with money through two cases. The first case was the paying of the temple tax (Matt. 17:24-27). In this case we see that the Lord did not carry any money in His pocket. The second case was His entrusting the money to Judas (John 12:6; 13:29). In that case we also see that the Lord's pocket did not carry money. Judas was the only one suitable to carry money.</p><h2 class="head2">No Excess through Much Gathering<br />and No Lack through Little Gathering</h2><p>Paul's principle was that those who gather much have no excess, and those who gather little have no lack (2 Cor. 8:15). This is the principle of coordination in our work. If those who gather much have excess and those who gather little have lack, it means that there is no coordination.</p><h2 class="head2">Offering Up Everything<br />and Keeping Only What One Needs</h2><p>Concerning offerings, it is not a matter of offering one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is a matter of everyone being as frugal as possible. Other than his own necessities, he should offer up all the rest. Anything less than this is not up to the proper standard of serving the Lord. Neither the Lord nor the church will want anything less than this standard. Everyone who serves the Lord has to forsake everything to follow Him. Other than providing for his own daily needs, a man should offer up everything. Those who lay up riches for themselves are the servants of mammon.</p><p>Consider how many procedures the idol worshippers have to go through! They have to kneel down, burn incense, and so forth. We have to realize that serving mammon is just as complicated as worshipping idols. The book of Matthew says that where our treasure is, there is our heart also (6:21). Then it speaks of the matter of laying up riches. In order for our hearts to be saved, we have to be delivered from the laying up of riches. Those who have not been delivered from riches have not been saved in their hearts.</p><h2 class="head2">Giving to the Poor for the Purpose<br />of Being Delivered from the Power of Mammon</h2><p>Some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world. Why do we have to give to the poor? Giving to the poor is not merely for the sake of the poor. It is for the purpose of delivering ourselves from the power of mammon. When we do this, we promptly take care of the problem of money in our hands. Some people think that spending money on the poor is for the sake of the poor. Surely, it is a good thing for a poor person to be saved through our giving. But even if he is not saved, it is still a good thing for us to give. A person who cares much for money will go into eternity alone; no one will thank him. But those who spend money on others will find others welcoming them in the heavens. Those who offer themselves up in laboring must also offer themselves up in material giving. It is one thing to be poor. It is another thing to have the kind of poverty that Paul refers to, which enriches many (2 Cor. 6:10). The amount of excess we have is the amount of sin we have. The amount of excess we have is the amount of idols we have.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SUBMISSION<br />TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">First Finding Out the Deputy Authority</h2><p>Witness Lee: How can one see the authority of the Body?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The submission of some people seems to be selective. In order to practice submission, the first thing to ask is who is above me. When we go to work in the secular world, we should first ask who the boss is. If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished. The same principle applies to working in an office or in an institution. The first thing that comes to the mind of many people when they sit down is how to be the boss. These people need to learn a serious lesson of submission. Submission is a lesson that a man has to learn before God. We have to be disciplined to such an extent that we bear a submissive nature. Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is.</p><p>For example, the brothers and sisters who are staying at our guest houses have to submit to the authority in that house. When they come to the meeting, they have to submit to the ushers and have to sit where they are told to sit. Every house that you stay in has its own authority. A Christian should learn to look for authority and to submit to authority. All those who pretend to be the head do not know what headship means in the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission without Any Preference</h2><p>I have never seen a man who knows the Head yet does not submit to Christ's deputy authority. A person who knows the Lord will never be selective in the matter of submission. For example, Brother Witness's children cannot be selective in their submission to their father. If a brother or a sister has not learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception. The Bible says that there is no authority except from God (Rom. 13:1).</p><p>There are very few places in the Bible that speak of direct submission to God. Most of the time the Bible speaks of submission to man. Wherever you go, you have to submit, not criticize freely with your lips. If others give you some special authority, that is up to them. Nevertheless, you have to learn to submit. Many people have never learned the lesson. Wherever they go, they tear down the authorities, and they do not bridle their tongues. This kind of person is rebellious. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will not be wild Christians. Not only should we not be selective in our submission, but we should actively seek after the ones we should submit to.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission to Authority<br />Being the Nature of the Lord's Life</h2><p>When I was staying in London, everything was set up by the host. In the morning we woke up at six o'clock. At noon we had our meal. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we had our afternoon tea. One Swiss brother from Japan shook his head and sighed every day. I asked why he was so unhappy. He was fifteen years older than I was, and he made tens of thousands of pounds every year. He had a few thousand workers working under him. He told me that he was having a hard time because he had not been a student for over twenty years. At the guest house where he was staying, the brother in charge was a rather uneducated person. It was very unpleasant for this Swiss brother to come under that brother's supervision. I stayed in London for eighteen months. If I had not learned submission, but instead criticized and opposed, how could I have been happy within? Submission is the nature of the Lord's life. It is for our protection to submit to God's authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning Submission in the Church</h2><p>A Christian should learn coordination, and coordination comes from submission. A rebellious and independent person is one who will not be coordinated. Christians should learn to submit one to another and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct. Not only should a person have the realization of authority in the church and in the Body, but when he is alone, he should still have this realization. We learn submission first in the church. It is rather difficult to learn submission outside the church. It is more natural to learn submission in the church. This is God's protection; it keeps us from exposing ourselves. If we learn the lesson this way, the spirit of antichrist will be removed from us.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT</h2><p>Concerning submission to our government, we know that no Christian can overturn any government. If certain political factors are contrary to our faith, the most we can do is escape. It is like what the Lord says, that we escape from one city to another. In the Bible escaping is not a shameful thing to do. If a government is not good, we can escape. But at the same time, all Christians should still pray for the governments that are not good.</p><p>One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We still have to keep them. But under certain circumstances, there are laws which a Christian cannot keep. Brother D. M. Panton once said that if a law is itself unlawful, we do not have to consider whether or not to keep that law. For example, Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrews to kill their male children. The midwives did not obey this order, yet the Bible says that God dealt well with them (Exo. 1:20). Moses' mother did not obey the order of Pharaoh (2:1-2), yet Hebrews 11 praised her faith. This is because Pharaoh's law was itself a lawless order. In the New Testament Peter and John were acting under the same principle when they disobeyed the order of the high priest.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">BROTHER NEE'S WORD OF FAREWELL<br />TO BROTHER K. H. WEIGH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 29, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>(Editor's Note: Brother K. H. Weigh arrived in Shanghai in early April to attend the co-workers' fellowship. On April 30 he left Shanghai to go to Foochow. This message is Brother Nee's word of farewell to Brother Weigh on the evening before Brother Weigh left.</p><p>There is only one Christ, but due to different viewpoints and different emphases of the workers, it seems that Christ has been divided into many Christs. If a worker cannot express to others the one Christ whom God desires to present, his work is a failure. Many today have very intimate contact with the Lord, whereas others are merely pressing upon Him (Mark 5:24). Perhaps some indeed touched His back, held His hand, or tore His garments, but they had no relationship whatsoever with Him in life. Among the many who thronged Jesus, the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill, but she was the only one healed in life (Matt. 9:20-22).</p><p>Some today indeed know the Christ of Bethsaida (Mark 8:22-26), the Christ of Gadara (5:1-20), or the Christ of Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). In their experience they have really seen miracles and wonders. They may even be able to perform the miracles themselves. Yet if there is no true inward revelation, none of these works will amount to anything. Some may be able to tell others with moving power about a Christ of Emmaus. They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts, but it is all to no avail. The real work is to impart a Christ of revelation to others. I speak these words not only to Brother Weigh, but to all the co-workers and to all the brothers and sisters alike. If you and I cannot impart a Christ of revelation to others, our work is a failure.</p><p>Here we see that there are basically two different stands that a worker of the Lord can take: one emphasizes work, the expounding of the Scriptures, miracles, works of wonders, answers to prayers, and so forth. The other presents a Christ of revelation before men.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">BROKENNESS AND MINISTRY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 30, 1948, Friday, 6:30 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE ONE TALENT IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>Chi Yung-tung: What does the one talent in the Bible (Matt. 25:15) refer to?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The one talent refers to the gift that the believers receive through the Lord's redemption. Today the church fails because the one-talented ones have failed. If all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested, and others will see what the Body is. Every redeemed one has at least one talent; no one can have less than one talent.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING COORDINATION IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for Arrangements</h2><p>Chu Cheng: Is the coordination of the Body something spontaneous, or is there some kind of arrangement?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Strictly speaking, our coordination before the Lord should be something spontaneous, but the problem today is that the young ones do not see the matter of coordination. This is why the brothers ahead of them should make some arrangements.</p><p>In the Epistles to Timothy, Paul did not leave one thing for Timothy to make his own decision about. He only required that Timothy and those with him be obedient. Today if we do not make any arrangements, many people will not coordinate together.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission Helping a Person<br />to Break through His Individual Limitations</h2><p>There are certain advantages to being coordinated. All of our judgments before the Lord are based on the light that we have received. The amount of light we see determines the amount of judgment we have. During the first few years of their Christian life, many people do not see much light. Their work and conduct surely cannot exceed the light they see. Hence, their work and conduct are limited by their judgments, and their judgments are limited by the light they have received. At Pentecost the church became a strong testimony in an instant. Hence, as far as the church is concerned, it has been strong since the first day. But as far as the individuals are concerned, their condition progresses as time goes on. If the young ones accept the judgments of the older ones, they will be able to do things beyond their capacity, and all the services before the Lord will be covered properly. In this way the church will gain a profit. If all the one-talented ones will submit to authority, they will not remain with one talent; rather, they will make a profit. We have to see that the riches in the church far exceed the riches of individual members.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FOLLOWING THE MINISTRY OF THE AGE</h2><h2 class="head2">Seeing the Ministry of the Age</h2><p>Question: How should Jonathan in the Old Testament (Saul's son&mdash;1 Sam. 14:1-46) have chosen his way?</p><p>Watchman Nee: In the Old Testament both Solomon and David represented the Lord. The two persons represented the one ministry in two separate ways. In the Old Testament there were many ministries. After Moses, the judges were raised up. After that, there was Solomon, the kings, and the prophets. After the Israelites were taken into captivity, the vessels for the recovery were raised up. The Old Testament is filled with different kinds of ministries. In every age there is the ministry of that age. These ministries of the ages are different from the local ministers. Luther was a minister of his age. Darby was also a minister of his age. In every age the Lord has special things that He wants to accomplish. He has His own recoveries and His own works to do. The particular recovery and work that He does in one age is the ministry of that age.</p><h2 class="head2">Forsaking the Past Ministries</h2><p>Jonathan stood between Saul and David. He was one man standing between two ministries. He should have followed the second ministry. However, because Jonathan's relationship with the first ministry was too deep, he could not disentangle himself. In order to catch up with the ministry of the age, there is the need for us to see the vision. Michal was married to David, yet she did not see anything. She only saw David's condition before God, and she could not tolerate it. As a result, she was left behind (2 Sam. 6:16, 20-23).</p><h2 class="head2">All Being a Matter of God's Mercy</h2><p>It is God's mercy that a person can see and come into contact with the ministry of that age. Yet it is altogether a different thing for a man to take up the courage to forsake the past ministry. It is a precious thing to see, and it is a blessed thing to come into contact with something. Yet whether or not one can set aside his past ministry is entirely up to God's mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE CONTENT OF THE MINISTRY</h2><h2 class="head2">The Outward Man Being Broken,<br />and the Inward Life Being Released</h2><p>Witness Lee: What is the relationship between the knowledge of life and the service?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The word knowledge cannot adequately describe the way we are taking. Whether or not a man's ministry can be released depends not only on whether he knows life, but on whether his outward man is broken. The content of the ministry is fully a matter of the life within.</p><p>We have an outward man, and we have an inward man. Some people's outward man is broken, and their ministries are released. Many years ago I gave a message on the Lord's Day morning entitled "Deep Calls unto Deep.'' A man who is not broken outwardly can only have "shallow calls unto shallow.''</p><p>Every one of the brothers from Kiangsu is an eloquent speaker. Yet, when a person touches them, he feels that there is something wrong. These brothers are like drops of oil on the water. They are shallow, and they do not have any depth. If you ask them to speak, they can speak with their clever minds for two hours. But after their speech, you cannot touch their spirit at all.</p><h2 class="head2">The Outward Man Being Broken<br />for the Inward Man to Be Released</h2><p>What we need today is for the outward man to be broken. If the outward man is not broken, the inward man will not be released. Everything outward has to be broken. Only when that which is outward is broken can that which is inward be released. The earthen vessel has to be broken before the treasure can be released (2 Cor. 4:7). As long as the ointment is in the alabaster box, the fragrance will not be released. Only when the box is broken will the fragrance be released (John 12:3).</p><p>God deals with us daily through our environment. On the one hand, the Lord works in us. On the other hand, He makes arrangements in our environment. Strictly speaking, for a Christian there is no such thing as the environment; with him, there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Every environment is a discipline of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of these disciplines is to break our outward man. Once a man's thoughts are broken, his inward man flows out. Once a man's emotions are broken, his inward man also flows out.</p><h2 class="head2">The Release of Our Inward Man<br />to Touch Others' Inward Man</h2><p>We should never think that as long as we say the right thing and the proper words, we will be all right. There is another question: Do the words we say come from our outward man or our inward man? We can only blame the co-workers for the condition of the brothers in Kiangsu. A person whose outward man has not been broken may use the same terms and speak the same thing; his words may even mean the same thing. Yet we cannot touch anything in the words he speaks. If we want to serve others, our outward man must be broken. Only when the outward man is broken can the inward man be released. Only when our inward man comes out can we touch others' inward man.</p><h2 class="head2">The Extent of the Outward Man Being Broken<br />Determining the Amount of Ministry One Has</h2><p>A clever man, who is capable of thinking and scheming, is not very useful in spiritual things. You may speak something with a smile, or you may speak the same thing with tears. The issue is not how you speak; the issue is how much of your inward man is released. Today the extent that a man is broken determines the amount of ministry he has. We all have to be dealt with by the Lord in these matters. We love to meet some whose outward man is broken. Once we see such people, we touch their inward man. The purpose for which we are disciplined and restricted is that our outward man may be broken. A man can be talking about sad things on the platform, yet not feel sad at all. He can be talking about happy things, yet not feel any joy. This kind of person can only perform; he cannot preach. Some people are so hard in their outward man that they have no response no matter what is said. They are like the men at the time of John the Baptist, who would not dance when others played the flute and would not mourn when others sang a dirge (Matt. 11:17).</p><h2 class="head2">No Short Cut</h2><p>The basis of a man's ministry is his knowledge before God. But whether or not the ministry can be released depends on whether the outward man is broken. When we began to learn to be a minister of the word, we learned to have the proper knowledge before God. However, the more we go on, the more we have to see that there can be no real ministry unless the outward man is broken. If the rubber tree is not cut, the sap will not flow out. It is impossible for a person who has no wound to have a ministry. There is no short cut. Even today some people still do not know what it means to utter something from their inward man.</p><p>Never forget that a man can only have a certain ministry if he is dealt with by the Lord. After a man has been dealt with, his spirit will be more pure. Whether or not a man's spirit can be released depends fully on whether he has been dealt with. At the same time whether or not a man's spirit is clean depends on whether he has been dealt with. Once the outward man is broken, the inward man can be released, and a person's word will be able to reach others' hearts. Many people think that as long as a person can help others become excited and bring in an exciting atmosphere, everything will be all right. But those who have never been cut open in their outward man will not be of much use. Christian service is based on brokenness. The degree of brokenness and the amount of wounding determine the amount that will be released.</p><p>How should a man speak in order that his spirit can be released? The only way for his spirit to be released is for his outward shell to be broken. Whether or not a man's outward shell is broken determines whether his inward spirit is released. If a man wants to have a spirit that can be used, his outward man must be smitten. At the time we are regenerated, the Lord comes into our spirit. At that time our spirit is like the Holy of Holies; it is full of light and life. However, whether or not the Lord can be released depends on whether our outward man is broken. If the outward man is broken, outward things will no longer be a hindrance to us. On the contrary, they will all become outlets for the spirit to be released. If our mind and emotion are broken, they will no longer become a hindrance to the flow of life. On the contrary, they will become the channels for the inward man to be released. After a man has been broken, his mind and emotion will become the gateway for his inward man to go out. Every city in the world has only four gates. Only the New Jerusalem has twelve gates (Rev. 21:12). Whether Christ can be released from us depends on whether or not we have been broken.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken</h2><p>The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body. If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose. For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts. In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken. Only then will his inward man be released. We should not be Christians for so many years and yet still remain whole and unchanged.</p><p>You can say that you have not received great revelations before the Lord. But you cannot say that for all these years you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The goal of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for you to be a broken man. One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man. By that time, you will realize how easy it is for your spirit to be released. In order for the inward man to be released, there is the need for severe dealings from the Lord. Those who have never been dealt with cannot afford the Lord a way to go on.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Mercy</h2><p>Every spiritual thing is received by men who are balanced and who are just right in everything. We can neither be too much nor too little. Those who are over-zealous in their pursuit will not receive anything. Neither will those who are lazy receive anything. When we ask, we have to ask in a proper measure; we cannot ask for nothing, and we cannot ask for too much. Sometimes when we ask more, it will be too much, and when we ask less, it will be too little. We need God's mercy. Spiritual growth does not depend on a person's running. But then, those who do not run will not receive anything either. If God grants you mercy, you will run according to just the right measure. For this reason, everyone has to commit himself to the God of all mercies (Rom. 9:16). If we do this, we will become just right in everything.</p><p>Today we can only say that we are those who have experienced God's mercy. Spiritual growth is something that is totally beyond man's power to control. God has to put us in a place of total inability and total helplessness before He can have a way in us. If the Lord is merciful to us, we will get through. If the Lord is not merciful to us, we can do nothing. Many people receive frequent chastisements, yet their outward man is not broken at all. In order to become a minister, the only way is for us to look to God's mercy. No one can be in haste in this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Deeper Knowledge of the Lord's Life<br />through the Lord's Dealings</h2><p>Yu Cheng-hwa: Can we say that the content of the ministry is our knowledge of life?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We know the Lord by learning the lessons through His dealings and smitings. When our outward man is broken, we will begin to know the Lord. A man knows the Lord through the process of being smitten. When we are smitten by the Lord day by day, our knowledge of the Lord will increase day by day, and we will see how His life replaces our life. This is not an increase in life, but an increase in knowledge. We have this life already. But through the Lord's dealings, we will gain a deeper knowledge of this life.</p><h2 class="head2">Passing through the Dealings<br />to Know the Riches of the Lord's Life</h2><p>The life that all the believers receive is a rich life. Yet we do not realize how rich this life is. It is only when our outward shell is broken that we realize how rich the Lord's life is and how it can achieve things that we cannot achieve.</p><p>During the war in Europe, one man was hit by forty-seven bullets, yet he still lived. A man's body can take in as many as forty-seven bullets and yet still live. Some people are very healthy, and their bodies have never been cut once. These people have not yet found out the amount of abuse the body can endure. The riches of the Lord's life are beyond any of our imaginations. Hence, no one should feel sad about the trials that come upon him. Trials are there not only to test a man's faith; the purpose of these trials is for the Lord's life to be expressed. God measures to us all kinds of circumstances and environments in order that we would receive the benefit of knowing Him. Only those who have passed through the dealings will know God, and only those who know God will be able to serve Him.</p><h2 class="head2">Paying a High Price for the Lord to Have a Way</h2><p>Today our outward man has to be broken before the inward man can be built up. We have to consecrate ourselves in a desperate way to the Lord before He will bring us through. If we do not put ourselves in His hand in a desperate way, the Lord will do nothing. There was once a sister who had an argument with her family, and she threatened to kill herself. She told everyone that she was going to jump into the river. The family followed her to the edge of the water. But when they saw her carefully holding up her skirts, they realized that she was not going to kill herself. Today, unless we are reckless in giving up everything, we will not have a way to go on. If a man worries about this and that, if he always makes sure that he is not too much, and if he is always careful and afraid, he will not be able to go on. A man has to learn to pay the price in a desperate way. If we want to be a Christian, we have to be one in a desperate and thorough way. Today is the end time. We need desperate people. Otherwise, there will be no spiritual future for us. It is difficult for those who go halfway and then are reluctant and unwilling at heart to go on. Among us, we need to have some desperate ones to rise up. Only then will the Lord have a way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">REPORT ON THE WORK</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 1, 1948, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">PUTTING THE JERUSALEM PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE</h2><p>It is a little too early for the co-workers to take the way of Antioch today. The principle of Antioch that we practiced before begins from Acts 13. In practice we have omitted chapters one through twelve; we have skipped the line of Jerusalem. Man thinks that the work of spreading the gospel from Jerusalem through Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth was done by the twelve apostles. But God's Word says that the apostles remained in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1). Jerusalem was the place where Peter worked, and Samaria was the place where Philip worked. When Philip reached Samaria, he gained the Samaritans. The Lord did say that the gospel is to be preached to the uttermost part of the earth, but He did not say that the same group of people would be doing this. Those who went to Samaria were one group, and those who go to the uttermost part of the earth are another group. When the apostles gained men in Jerusalem, they sent them out to Samaria. From Samaria the gospel will pass through other hands until it reaches the uttermost part of the earth. In the past we put the principle of Antioch into practice too early. Now is not the time to practice the principle of Antioch. Now is the time to practice the principle of Jerusalem.</p><p>Although we cannot say that we are absolutely clear today, when the few responsible brothers came together, we felt that we should begin our work from the coastal regions. From now until August can be considered as one phase of our work. During this phase all the workers in the whole nation will consolidate in Foochow and Shanghai. Brother Witness Lee will take up the responsibility in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Ke-san will take up the responsibility in Foochow.</p><p>In addition, we need to have training meetings. After August the work will concentrate on three areas: Tientsin, Tsingtao, and Canton. We will leave Hong Kong, Swatow, and Peking alone for the time being. We will initially establish a firm footing in the first three places. Tientsin is linked to Manchuria on the one hand, and to the Northwest on the other hand. Tsingtao will be particularly important to the Chiao-Chi railway line. Today the largest number of believers are in Fukien. Next is Shantung. From Tsingtao we can gain the whole province of Shantung. We hope to commit the whole area to the brothers in Tsingtao. The responsibility of the brothers in Shanghai is toward the west, in cities like Hankow and Chungking. The direction in Fukien is also toward the west. At the same time, Fukien should take care of Taiwan. The work in the provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi should begin from Canton. In the future, when Southeast Asia rises up, Hong Kong should also have a start. Presently, we cannot see that far. The gospel work is done in portions. The relay race is a very good illustration. One man takes one portion, and the next man takes another portion. This is like the students of Chiao-Tung University who ran from Nanking to Shanghai; every one of them ran a portion of the whole journey.</p><p>We admit that the principle of Antioch is still very necessary for the future, but the way we should take at present is the way of Jerusalem. The work is developed through the fruit gained in Jerusalem, not through the going out of the workers. Every believer should have his living centered on the gospel; his work, occupation, dwelling, and livelihood should all be for the gospel. The church should continually send out more people. After we finish the building of the meeting hall, in a month or so, it will not be difficult to see the number double. It is even possible to triple or quadruple our number in one year.</p><p>Our failure during the past years has been due to the absence of the vision of the Jerusalem principle. From 1937 we have been practicing the principle of Antioch. But only today, in 1948, have we begun to go back to the principle of Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Conducting Trainings<br />to Produce Standard Christians</h2><p>We have to say something about the training in Foochow. Our work in the past had certain problems; we did not produce "standard'' Christians. Those who were saved among us in certain years bear certain kinds of resemblances. Those who were saved in certain other years bear certain other kinds of resemblances. Their resemblance is based on our knowledge of the truth during that period of time.</p><p>In addition, there are certain problems with the brothers who are speaking for the Lord; that is, none of them want to say the same thing twice. As a result, some brothers and sisters have been Christians for over eight or ten years, but they still do not know the basic truths. They think that such and such a chapel is just the same as the meeting place in Wen-teh Lane. They do not even recognize our own name! A Christian acts according to the principle of constitution. Hospitals, schools, and orphanages can be built at will. But a nation cannot be formed at will; it must have its ground and its constitution. Likewise, the church also has its ground and its constitution. We have not given the brothers and sisters the proper education. As a result, once they encounter some problems or once they are questioned by those in the denominations, they do not know how to give an answer, and they end up thinking that our responsible brothers are at odds with others.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Basic Lessons<br />and Receiving the Same Teachings</h2><p>There are many basic lessons that we have to pass on to the saints. Those who have been saved in recent years may be clear concerning salvation, but they are not clear concerning the gospel. Our understanding of subjects such as the gospel, the law, death, sin, righteousness, and grace is different from that of others. We have fought the battle over these truths already. These are the inheritance of the church, and we cannot lose them. For the brothers and sisters, we may have to prepare fifty or more lessons. We have to educate the brothers and sisters with these lessons. I hope that many brothers and sisters among us will receive the same teachings.</p><p>In addition to these lessons, there are other basic lessons. For example, we should know how to make recompense, what to do when a person is caused to stumble, how to receive answers to prayers, how to study the Bible, what kind of attitude a Christian should take toward money, and how to choose an occupation. In these matters the co-workers must first be trained, and then they can communicate these matters to others. These truths must be something living in us before they can be communicated to others in a living way. This is what I mean by the relay race.</p><h2 class="head2">The Workers Needing to Be<br />Living and Full of Life</h2><p>We have divided the whole of Shanghai into thirteen districts, and we have started perfecting meetings in every district. Every Friday we conduct some perfecting meetings. Each week of the fifty-two weeks of the year, we speak on one subject. In one year's time we will return to the first subject. We will not change these subjects. Although the responsible ones do not take the roll, they should know who is there and who is not there. Suppose you are saved in the twentieth week. You will join the others in the perfecting meetings right away. By the nineteenth week of the following year, you will have completed one cycle. In doing this work, every worker must be living before the Lord and must be full of life. Otherwise, the truth will become something dead with him. If it becomes dead, we will end up with another Common Prayer Book. We do not wish to see this. Although the subjects may be the same, the life can be different, and the power can be different. By the summer of this year, over thirty of our co-workers will have to be trained in this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE LITERATURE WORK</h2><p>We also need a full recovery in our literature work. There are four magazines that need to be recovered. The first is The Christian, and we ask Brother Witness Lee to be responsible for it. The second is The Present Testimony, and we ask Brother Yu Cheng-hwa to be responsible for it. The third is The Glad Tidings, and we ask Brother Stephen Kaung to be responsible for it. The fourth is The Open Door, and I myself will be responsible for it. In addition, we need some gospel tracts, and we will ask Brother Chang Yu-zhi to be responsible for them. There is urgent need in the publication of books, and the cost will run up to a few hundred millions or even a billion dollars [in war-inflated local currency].</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h2><p>We expect to see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel and all the brothers and sisters serving God together, rather than three or five people serving by themselves. The works that the church has to do include: first, the preaching of the gospel, which should not just be the responsibility of those who are giving the messages; second, there is the gospel visitation, which is conducted in the homes; third, there is the visitation of the new believers; fourth, there is the perfecting of the new believers; and fifth, there is the care for the poor.</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2><h2 class="head3">Mobilizing All the Brothers and Sisters</h2><p>The first kind of service is the preaching of the gospel. The brothers responsible for the preaching of the gospel should promote the gospel work in all the districts, schools, and other places. These few brothers should not just be responsible for the preaching itself but should be responsible for mobilizing others to preach the gospel. Whether or not our work can be successful depends not only on how well the responsible brothers are serving, but on how much the other brothers and sisters are serving. Today in Christianity there are no priests; there are only pastors. But among us we have to put all the one-talented ones to use. When all the one- talented ones rise up, we will have the church. If we replace their functions, we are wrong. The right thing to do is to help them along in their work.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Being Negligent<br />and Not Being Covetous for Gain</h2><p>At the same time, if you are a person who is not serious and who is loose and irresponsible, you cannot serve God. You cannot serve God in a careless or negligent way. I am not hired by the church; I am not receiving the church's salary. I am not a hireling. I am here to serve God. As such, I cannot be negligent. Others may have to sleep on the floor in order to get their work done. I have to be more desperate than they are; I have to sleep under the floor. If a man cannot be negligent in serving the earthly things, how much more must he not be negligent in serving God? We are not here for money. In order to serve the Lord, we cannot ask anyone for anything, not even a bowl of rice. We serve because we love the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">Everyone Participating</h2><p>Every week we should have a gospel meeting, and every brother and sister should invite people to come to this meeting. This should be the responsibility of all the members. Never allow the brothers and sisters to develop the habit of asking what the meeting that night is about. If it is going to be a gospel meeting, do not let them say, "All right. I will go home and sleep.'' You have to say to such brothers, "No. Now that you realize it is a gospel meeting, you have to rise up immediately, because you have a part in this meeting.''</p><h2 class="head2">Gospel Visitation<br />and Visitation of the New Believers</h2><h2 class="head3">Being Baptized as soon as One Is Saved</h2><p>The responsibility of visiting the new believers is quite heavy. If the church assigns a certain brother to visit someone, this brother should take the one who introduced the new one to the church along with him. As soon as a person is saved, he should be baptized. Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting a while to be baptized, they became dead. As soon as a person believes, he should be baptized. If he is baptized and something happens later, he will not feel so free to deny his faith.</p><h2 class="head3">The Whole Church Working,<br />Bringing Increase in Quantity and Quality</h2><p>In arranging the visitation we should divide up the city into districts according to the map. Once the time is ripe and there is a certain number of ones desiring to be baptized, we should baptize them. If we do this, we will double our investments in a short time. No other period of time affords as much opportunity as today for the work to go on. If the whole church rises up, there will be no place to hold the blessings. Within one to two months a thousand people were saved in Foochow. When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard. Everyone who is born this way will be an eight- to nine-pound baby; no one will be a twelve-ounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator.</p><h2 class="head3">Teaching Others to Serve God<br />Properly and Conscientiously</h2><p>I must speak a frank word to you. You have to speak honest words to others. In the past a certain person may have been loose, and you may have let it go. But you cannot do that any longer. If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work. After he has agreed to work, you still have to ask, "Why are you so loose? Why would you not be careful in taking care of the things of God? You need to learn. Who told you to hand over yourself to be a child of God in the first place? As long as you are His child, you have to serve, and you have to serve in a conscientious way.''</p><h2 class="head2">The Perfecting of the New Believers</h2><h2 class="head3">Conducting the New Believers' Meetings by Districts</h2><p>We have to conduct the new believers' meetings in the districts. This is because many live too far away and cannot otherwise attend this meeting. Presently, we consider everyone to be a new believer, and we are giving make-up lessons to all. Among the brothers we have selected twenty to do the teaching work in the thirteen districts. The subjects covered in the thirteen districts are the same, and their contents are the same. This meeting is set up specifically for the perfecting of the new believers.</p><h2 class="head3">Those Who Are Absent<br />Needing to Receive Make-up Lessons</h2><p>The ones who are responsible for visiting the new believers should go out on Friday evening to give make-up lessons to those who were absent the previous week. In giving the make-up lessons, you have to do a detailed job. Then a person will receive the same teachings, whether or not he comes to the meeting. For example, Brother Cheng may give a message for two hours with sweat all over him. After he finishes, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson. Someone may say, "Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already. When others do not come to the meeting, he still has to spend time to give make-up lessons.'' By saying this, the one who has been absent from the meeting will say, "That is not right. Next time I think I have to come to the meeting.''</p><p>This kind of work is most definite and fine. Everywhere we go, we will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place, and we will be able to make up the lack. If we practice this, our work will not be as confused and uncoordinated as it is today.</p><h2 class="head2">Caring for the Poor</h2><h2 class="head3">The Lord's Commandment</h2><p>There are three kinds of people among us: first, sinners; second, new believers; and third, the poor. The church is never free from having a relationship with the poor people. If anyone feels happy about offering money to the Lord but unhappy about giving money to the poor, he is wrong. It is wrong to leave the ointment in the alabaster box; we should offer it up to the Lord. It is right for us to take care of the Lord and His work first. But after the alabaster box is poured out, the Bible tells us to sell everything we have and give it to the poor. Caring for the poor is also a commandment of the Lord (Luke 12:33).</p><h2 class="head3">A Practice of the Church in the Time of Revival</h2><p>In church history we see that whenever there was a revival, there was the practice of caring for the poor. Strictly speaking, it is a small thing for a poor person to eat more or eat less, to have more clothing or less clothing. But it is a serious thing for a Christian to become narrow in his heart. If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have. If you do this, your money will not become a hindrance any longer.</p><h2 class="head3">The Normal Work of the Church</h2><p>Caring for the poor is not just the work of the church at the time of revival; it is also the normal work of the church. It is part of a Christian's daily life. We hope that the brothers and sisters would go home and bring back what they have to the church. We want everything, new and old. We have brothers and sisters who can wash, sew, and mend these things, and who can distribute them. Every time the church receives some money from the offering box, it should set aside a certain amount for the poor. We need one brother and one sister who are designated for this relief work. It is good if some can give good messages. But if you cannot give a good message, it is equally good if you can give away your belongings.</p><p>We have to learn to be those who are led away to the lowly. If the ones who receive our help are saved, that is an additional blessing. But even if they are not saved, you will still receive the benefit. All the things in the brothers' and sisters' homes that they do not need should be sent away to the church. If your house is cleared of all these things, you may end up having fewer burdens to bear. Some people may have their backs bent over by the burden of these things.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ARRANGEMENT OF PERSONNEL</h2><p>We need to make some announcements concerning the arrangement of personnel. First, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel work...Second, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel visitation work...Third, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the new believers' meetings...Fourth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the visitation of the new believers. ..Fifth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of caring for the poor...If there are other arrangements, we will notify the brothers and sisters through printed circular letters.</p><h2 class="head1">OTHER MATTERS</h2><p>We still have some announcements to make concerning other matters. For the brothers who are holding jobs and the students who are still in school, we ask that they would not drop their present occupation. When you receive some light from the Lord, we hope that you will make adjustments according to the light you receive.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OFFERING OF MATERIAL RICHES</h2><p>Concerning money, we need to make some public announcements. If we preach the gospel well and if all the brothers and sisters are coordinated together, our homes, our occupations, and our money will all be for the gospel. The responsible brothers will help the saints make proper arrangements for the possessions that they have handed over. Some money should be retained for one's own use, while other money should circulate. We hope that we will not need to spend too much time to ask how the brothers and sisters spend their money. In this matter much of the responsibility rests with the individuals. The church does not want to touch this matter too much. If the brothers and sisters are too much off the mark, some should remind them a little about the proper way. The kind of living each one maintains before the Lord should be determined by each person's own standard. The church cannot make such a decision for the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Concerning the offering of material riches, we hope that part of what the brothers and sisters put into the offering box will be used for local expenses and part for the caring for the poor. In addition, the brothers and sisters have to learn to follow the Lord's guidance in giving personal gifts to individuals. The money that is set aside for the work can be dropped into the offering box that is set apart for the work. If everyone gives up all his excess, those who gather much will not have excess, and those who gather little will not have want.</p><p>We expect every worker to exercise faith before the Lord. We do not want to distribute money to the co-workers that is designated for the work, thus making the work suffer through the lack of money. However, we do not want to see any excess in money, and we do not want to see the work falling behind the supply. We hope to see the work and money going up in proportion to one another. We want the brothers and sisters to do their best to be frugal. We hope that no one will try to save up his money for future use. Every time we receive some income, we have to give, and we should not worry about our future.</p><p>Presently, the fund for the work in Shanghai is under the management of Brother Witness Lee and Brother Tang Shou-ling. The fund for the work in Foochow is under the management of Brother Chen Ke-san and Chan Si-wen. In all other places, we will not receive money for the work. For example, if the brothers in Chefoo or Tsingtao want to offer something for the work, they should send it to either of the two places we mentioned.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE RECEIVING OF CO-WORKERS&mdash;<br />THE NEED FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION</h2><p>There is one thing we would like the saints from out of town to pay attention to: You have been receiving and acknowledging co-workers on our behalf for a long time. This practice has given us much trouble. If someone comes to your place to work, please ask him to show you the letter of recommendation from us. In the past you have acknowledged some co-workers whom we find it hard to acknowledge. In the New Testament Paul also spoke of the matter of a recommendation letter (2 Cor. 3:1-3). Today, not only is there the need for recommendations in matters related to the church; there is the need for recommendations in matters related to the work as well. If a letter only recommends a certain person as a brother, you have to treat him as a brother. If he is also a co-worker, there should be a separate recommendation letter to recommend him as a co-worker.</p><p>May the Lord cause all of us to do our best to stand firm in our own position. Whether a person is making money or is engaged in spiritual services, he should offer up everything he has. We hope that we will do a proper job before the Lord in all these matters, and we hope that we will see God's blessings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">REPORT ON THE WORK</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 2, 1948, Lord's Day, 3:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING<br />THE FUTURE OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Understanding the Meaning<br />of Handing Over Oneself,<br />and Having the Reality of It</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Last night there was one thing that we did not announce, which is the arrangements concerning the future of the co-workers.</p><p>I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us concerning the purpose of handing over ourselves. We have to see that we are all priests before God (1 Pet. 2:5). Both Exodus 19 and Romans 12 tell us that everyone is a servant before God. At the same time we see that service is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter. This is the reason we ask all the brothers and sisters to hand over themselves. Actually, there should be no need to speak about this matter. As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a priest. Originally, many things could be said directly after a person believed. However, due to the captivity of the church into Babylon, degradation came in, and there was the need for a recovery. Today the church is indeed the community of saved ones, but it is not yet the community of serving ones. If God's children do not serve, the church will merely become a "club house'' of saved ones, a place where saved ones come together to sing, preach, and meet. This is to change the basic nature of the church.</p><p>Because the church has become fallen, all the brothers and sisters have become free to do whatever they like and to express whatever opinion they have. As a result, many things have become optional, and some have become lawful. On the one hand, no one likes to meddle with others' affairs. On the other hand, we do not like others to meddle with our affairs. For this reason some barriers develop among God's children. But God's Word says that the church is the place where men serve God. It is the place where God's children work and labor together in one accord. The church as seen from God's Word is very different from the church of today. In God's Word every person, matter, and event are for serving God.</p><p>In the future we have to bring everyone up to this standard. Many people who have become Christians do not know what it means to serve God. In the future we will not have to tell the saved ones to hand over themselves; by that time, they will not be able to be a Christian if they do not hand themselves over the first day. If a man does not forsake everything, he will not be able to step into the door. Those who do not forsake everything to follow the Lord cannot be His disciples (Matt. 10:37-38). Outwardly speaking, it seems difficult for a man to forsake everything. But inwardly speaking, this is something that brings us joy. A man must be brought to a point where he is willing to give up everything. Only then will he be able to follow a straight course. Today, when we ask you to consecrate, we have to persuade you to do it. But in the future we will not need to persuade anyone. A man will either drop the world completely, or he will not be able to be baptized at all. Either you come in an absolute way or you do not come. Some people have said that the term "handing over'' is wrong. We are not arguing about terminology today. You can call it whatever you like. What matters is the reality. In the past men thought that serving God was a matter of personal choice. They thought that being zealous or not was one's own business, and that serving or not was also one's own business. But now this is changed around. If there is the coordination and you are in trouble, other brothers and sisters beside you will not let you fall. In this way the church interferes with as well as supports every individual. Many people will be watching over you as well as helping you and protecting you.</p><h2 class="head2">Everything Done in the Fellowship of the Church<br />and for the Benefit of the Gospel</h2><p>The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church. Formerly, one could make decisions on his own. But now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward. From now on no one can make his own decisions or do things his own way. Many enterprises and occupations do not render much help to the gospel. The responsible brothers will ask you to change these occupations. What we do must be of maximum benefit to the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING MONEY</h2><p>We have the following fellowship concerning money. In the coming days many brothers and sisters will have to leave their jobs. In Shanghai we have asked two sisters and two brothers to do this. Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has been working in the customs department for many years. We are asking him to leave that job. In addition, perhaps twenty to thirty brothers and sisters will also have to hand themselves over. Perhaps we will need fifty or sixty brothers and sisters to do this. If they give up their jobs and offer themselves up full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of the brothers who are holding jobs. During the past twenty years, we have not mentioned the matter of money. This platform can testify for me concerning this. But today we are going into business as partners and preaching the gospel as partners. For this reason, the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should work conscientiously, and they should do their best to make money as well as to save money.</p><p>Today we stand on a different ground, and that is why we are not afraid to say something and do something. Today I can pass around my hat to ask for money for a brother. If some have misunderstood what we have said and are no longer willing to offer up everything, you can claim back your consecration slip from Brother Witness after the meeting. There is no need to be shy and no need to be ashamed. We do not force anyone to do anything. But when the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back. Today we are not asking you to be frugal to the extent that you will suffer in your physical health. We are not asking for one-tenth, one-half, or one-hundredth. We are asking you to offer up all that you have except what you need. If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need. But if you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need. You have to offer up the remaining one million. If you make a hundred million, then ninety million will have to be offered up. If you do not do this, you owe these brothers who are giving up their jobs something. We have to learn to bear the responsibility of the gospel together with the brothers. Only by doing this will the gospel spread, and only then will we be able to go on in the way before us.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR THINGS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><p>Concerning the future of the work, there are a few things that we have to pay attention to. In order for God's work in China to be carried out properly, four things are indispensable. The first is that strong messages need to be delivered in the local meetings. The second is that the literature work needs to spread. The third is the need to perfect the young people. The fourth is the need for joint conferences everywhere yearly. If any of these four things are lacking, our work will not be covered adequately. Shanghai and Foochow should maintain very strong message meetings. Then when a person wants to be perfected, he has to come to the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SUITABLE MEETING HALLS<br />IN DIFFERENT PLACES</h2><p>Furthermore, we need suitable meeting halls. Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that in no place is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai. In the winter it is cold, and in the summer it is hot. When someone gives a message, the audience is spread out over seven or eight different places. The listeners cannot see the speaker, and in some places they cannot even hear the speaking. We have to build a meeting hall that can seat three thousand immediately and that can hold another two thousand if we add another level to it later. In total we need a place that can seat five thousand.</p><p>Many people have been stirred up in Nanking already. Hence, Nanking also needs a meeting hall. In addition, we have to consider how to maintain a strong message meeting in Nanking. Foochow also needs a meeting hall. Presently, the meeting hall in Foochow is very hot in summer, and the windows are on the roof. What the brothers and sisters have offered up in these days is not enough to take care of these three meeting halls.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE MAGAZINES</h2><p>Before the war we published an average of eighteen thousand copies of The Christian every issue. At its peak we were publishing twenty-one thousand copies. The publication of one magazine alone requires seven hundred million dollars. This is only one magazine. There are three other kinds of magazines. Do not think that it is a simple thing to put out a magazine. As far as an individual is concerned, it is an embarrassing thing to ask for money. But here we are not afraid of misunderstanding. Every month we need much money.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE TRAINING WITH THE HOSPITALITY</h2><p>One other thing needs to be mentioned. Among us, some want to serve the Lord, but there is no place where they can receive any training. This is shameful. In two places brothers wanted to learn to serve the Lord and were sent to seminaries. Presently, the brothers in all the places can surely learn something in their own church regarding how to take care of affairs and how to participate in the work. However, at the same time, they need some specific trainings. Presently, we have two hundred mous [a Chinese acre] of land in Kuling. There are some houses there, but the preparation work is only half complete; there are still many things that are not yet ready. When we had a few dozen co-workers meeting there, hospitality was a problem. Some had to sleep in a nearby hospital, like patients on hospital beds, because the hospitality was not adequate. This is too poor. We have to consolidate the hospitality before we can meet the need.</p><h2 class="head1">GRASPING THE BEST OPPORTUNITY<br />TO OFFER UP EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Today we have to offer up all our time for the gospel. Once I was at a meeting, and I asked the attendants if there were over fifty young people among them. I discovered that all of them were middle-aged and I could not go on with what I was going to say. Today if we have six hundred young people raised up among us, we will be busy all day long. Hence, we are short of people. At the same time we need a few hundred or even a few thousand brothers who are holding jobs to provide the support. If we do not do this, we will have no way to take care of the work. Today our work has to be done in a corporate way. In the past we thought that as long as we would find full-time brothers and would commit the responsibility of the gospel work to them, all the problems would be solved. But this is not the way today. Today we need to take care of the work together. No other period of time has been as easy as today for the gospel to go out. The opportunity for the gospel will be over in an instant. In Manchuria there are only two places left where the gospel can still be preached. Although North China has not yet fallen completely to the Communists, other than along a few railway lines, all the other places can no longer afford us the liberty to preach the gospel. If there are people who are strong enough and if we have enough money, we can bring three or five thousand people to the Lord in Foochow within a month. Once a person touches the gospel, he is saved. Once a person touches the gospel, he is subdued. If we want to give our all, now is the best time. Why are we not able to send out more people? In these days we are eager to go on in a fast way. I hope that some would rise up from among us immediately. I am not asking a little from you; I am asking everything from you. In the Lord's Word, there is no such thing as half-hearted Christians. If a man wants to serve God, he has to offer up everything. If there is a group of people who will rise up to truly offer up everything, the world will see the church. Unless we serve in this way, God will have no way to go on. If we want to serve, we have to be absolute. If we are not absolute, we may as well not serve. God wants everything. The Lord requires everything. All those who are in their jobs, in their occupations, in their schools, or in their homes have to offer up themselves. We need all the people and all the money to be spent on China. Today is the best opportunity for the gospel to be preached.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MONEY RECEIVED</h2><p>All the local brothers and sisters can put their offerings into the church offering box. Personal offerings can be given to the co-workers. The rest should be put in the fund for the work. If anyone wants to inquire about the accounting of the money for the work, you can go to Brother Lee and Brother Tang. The accounting of the church can be found in the church business office. The out-of-town brothers should first set aside an amount for their local use from their monthly offerings. If any money is designated for the work, it should be sent to Brother Witness and Brother Tang if it comes from the north, and should be sent to Brother Chen Ke-san and Chen Si-wen if it comes from the south.</p><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING A BALANCE</h2><p>Before God there are principles to everything we do, and we cannot do anything in a loose way. We are not like the missionary societies, who practice corporate faith. For over twenty years we have not dared to be tough in the matter of money. Today everything else may be soft, but if we are soft in the matter of money, God's Word will be softened. If we have a wrong attitude toward money and do not take care of it properly, God's Word will be sacrificed. On the one hand, we do not want to see anyone taking godliness as a means of gain. On the other hand, we have to maintain God's standard. We do not want to annul personal faith through corporate moves. But at the same time, we wish to see all the needs met. We hope that as long as there is prayer, there is answer to prayer. In this matter we hope to maintain a proper balance before God.</p><h2 class="head1">DETERMINING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>I have a few words to say about the co-workers. The basic need in the work is to know people. A doctor can use instruments such as a thermometer to measure temperature and a blood pressure cuff to measure blood pressure and pulse. For the workers, our spirit is our instrument. If our spirit has been dealt with, we will know what kind of persons others are as soon as their spirit touches ours. If you are a piece of rough stone, and another rough stone is put on top, the roughness of the other stone will not be accented. But if you are a smooth and flat piece of stone, and another piece of rough stone is placed on you, its angles and corners will be accented, and you will feel immediately which part is crooked and which part is not flat. You may not be able to pinpoint a person's mistakes, but when you touch such a one, you should be able to sense the rough parts in that person. In some places brothers have accepted co-workers on our behalf and have created many problems for us. This is because many of the ones that have been accepted are uneven and rough. I hope that we will have a deeper discernment concerning the co-workers. The workers who work in different places should bring letters of recommendation, without which they cannot be considered as our co-workers.</p><h2 class="head1">WITNESS LEE'S FELLOWSHIP</h2><h2 class="head2">The Gospel Work in Foochow</h2><p>I have traveled along the coastal regions of China. I have also been to the inland regions. Of all these places, no place is as good as Foochow today. While I stayed in Foochow for forty days, I saw people being saved in a very quick way, and their salvation experience was quite solid. When we were about to leave at the end of our work, God suddenly did a strong work. Originally, we thought that as long as we had ten or twenty that were willing to be baptized, we would baptize them. Hence, we made an announcement on Thursday that we were going to talk with the candidates on Friday. When the time came, over eighty came, and over seventy were accepted for baptism. As soon as some came in and sat down, the brothers were clear that they were saved. The answers the brothers received far exceeded what they hoped for. The first time we held a baptism, one hundred twenty people were baptized. The second week there were seventy to eighty. In addition to these, there were many other ones who were waiting to be baptized.</p><h2 class="head2">The Campus Work in Shanghai</h2><p>If we sent all the co-workers left in Shanghai to the campuses, it would not be enough to meet the need of the three universities. I venture to say that it is not suitable for the co-workers here in Shanghai to go to Foochow. At Chiao-Tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already. Chiao-Tung University has two to three thousand students. Shanghai Medical University has a thousand. When the Western missionaries came to preach the gospel in the past, they had to build their own houses and hire their own people. But now everything is ready. The ones to preach the gospel are there, and the ones to hear the gospel are also there. Chairs and lights are in the auditoriums already, and everything is so convenient. Today we have seventy to eighty university students among us. At Chiao-Tung University sixty students are breaking the bread. At National Medical University we have a few dozen students. But we are short of people, and we are short of money. We are short of these two things. Recently we bought a car, two passenger vans, and a big bus.</p><h2 class="head2">The Campus Work in Nanking</h2><p>In Nanking we have not officially started our work yet. But presently there are five hundred people breaking bread. In Nanking there are students who come from the remote regions of China. Presently, there are some brothers in the church who can speak the native Sinkiang language. Once when I was preaching the gospel, the dean of a certain school stood up to receive the Lord. After these brothers and sisters receive four years of spiritual education, they can become our "commando'' units when they graduate. If we do not let them go, then there is nothing to it. But if we let them go, these ones will go back to their home provinces to preach the gospel. They will go to Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet. The problem is still the lack of money. These schools are in the Shia-Kwang district. It is a problem for the students to come up with enough money to come to the meeting. God has done much work on the campuses, and the door of the gospel is wide open.</p><h2 class="head1">WATCHMAN NEE'S FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Perhaps Brother Lee will say that I have left too few co-workers in Shanghai. But it is not an easy thing to make arrangements. I have opened up my spirit to the brothers, and I hope that the brothers will also open up their spirit to me. Presently, the need in Shanghai cannot be met yet. Brother Lee's family cannot move here yet, and Brother David Hsu's family cannot move here either. Brother Chang Yu-zhi said that he will have to return home. Brother Kang has quit his job at the China Textile Corporation, and he can no longer live in its dormitory. Brother Tang Shou-ling will also quit his teaching job soon. We have a big need in preparing the outward matters to match the spiritual move. Many people criticize us in a cheap way. In the end they will not move even a little finger. We co-workers are working with a burden on our shoulders; we are not working in a light-hearted manner. Some people are here only as spectators. Our words are not for you.</p><p>Today in the Northwest, some still testify to their faith with their own blood. We can only help them in our prayers.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">A PRAYER FOR THE GOSPEL</h1><h2 class="head4">(Church Prayer Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 4, 1948, 7:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, ten years ago the Japanese occupied Shanghai. At that time we did not have the freedom to preach the gospel, and we prayed that if You would have mercy on us and give us another opportunity, we would surely preach the gospel properly. Now that problem is gone, and another problem is coming. The condition this time may even be worse than the last time. At that time we could still meet and serve individually. But if this problem comes, we will not even be able to meet. You have charged us to pray for those who are over us and who are in authority so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life. Now we cannot lead a tranquil life. We pray that You would give the church peace. Lord, we ask You to give us another chance. No matter how much time we have this time, we will sacrifice everything to preach the gospel. This is the church's prayer. At least, this is a prayer in one accord. We may not be in one accord in a thousand other things, but concerning this, we are in one accord. Although some may kill Stephen, You can still say to the Saul who fell on the ground, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads'' (Acts 26:14). May the Lord hear our prayer.</p><p>Witness Lee and Chu Cheng laid hands on Chang Hsing-rong, who was about to return to Manila via Taiwan, and prayed: Lord, here is a person whose heart has been gained by You. May that which You have gained in him be expressed out from him. May the Lord grant him peace, and bless all the works that are related to him so that he can spread abroad what he has received. May the Lord accomplish this work soon.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH THOSE<br />WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS</h1><h2 class="head4">(Church Conference)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 6, 1948, Thursday, 7:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">MEETING GOD BY ASCENDING</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Hark! ten thousand voices crying,<br />"Lamb of God!'' with one accord;<br />Thousand thousand saints replying,<br />Wake at once the echo'ng chord.<br /><br /></li><li>"Praise the Lamb!'' the chorus waking,<br />All in heav'n together throng;<br />Loud and far each tongue partaking<br />Rolls around the endless song.<br /><br /></li><li>Grateful incense this, ascending<br />Ever to the Father's throne;<br />Every knee to Jesus bending,<br />All the mind in heav'n is one.<br /><br /></li><li>All the Father's counsels claiming<br />Equal honors to the Son,<br />All the Son's effulgence beaming,<br />Makes the Father's glory known.<br /><br /></li><li>By the Spirit all pervading,<br />Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,<br />Crowned with light and joy unfading,<br />Hail Him as the great "I AM.''<br /><br /></li><li>Joyful now the new creation<br />Rests in undisturbed repose,<br />Blest in Jesus' full salvation,<br />Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.<br /><br /></li><li>Hark! the heavenly notes again!<br />Loudly swells the song of praise;<br />Through creation's vault, Amen!<br />Amen! responsive joy doth raise.<br /><br />(Hymns, #127)</li></ol><p>Watchman Nee: This hymn was written by Brother J. N. Darby. Originally, it had thirteen stanzas. Here it has seven stanzas. The whole hymn is a praise and also a poem. The first stanza and the last stanza seem to stand apart from the rest of the hymn.</p><p>The first stanza opens with "Hark!'' It is beckoning us to hear a voice. This hymn starts with a voice.</p><p>The second stanza tells us what one hears. It is the song of the heavenly chorus. The third line of this stanza says, "Loud and far each tongue partaking.'' This makes reference to every tongue in Philippians 2:11. The voice here is not just the voice of the redeemed, but the voice of the whole heaven plus the heavenly hosts.</p><p>Stanza three speaks of "every knee.'' "Each tongue'' in stanza two matches the "Lamb,'' while "every knee'' in stanza three matches "the Father's throne.'' All the praises are directed first to the Son and then to the Father. This is why stanza four speaks of the Father. In stanza five, the Spirit also comes in. With the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the creation can rest in repose. Darby's hymns have one feature: all of them express a yearning for rest.</p><p>Stanza six turns to us. The first few stanzas give a high praise, and the whole creation is sustained in this praise. If others were to write this hymn, they would have stopped at stanza five. But Darby went on to speak about us.</p><p>Stanza seven goes back to the praise in stanza one. In stanza one, the first "Hark!'' holds us up in heaven. In stanza seven, there is another "Hark!'' "Again'' in the first line of stanza seven is an echo of the first stanza. In lines three and four, there are two "amens.'' These two "amens'' are placed in an excellent place. The second "amen'' echoes the first "amen,'' just as the last stanza echoes the first stanza. In this way, the hymn reads like a poem.</p><p>Every hymn has to ascend in its sentiments. There should be a line through which one can trace the thoughts. If it is not ascending, or if the line stops abruptly, it will not be a good hymn. In the Psalms, there are songs of degrees, which means songs of ascent. If a hymn is not well written, it will become a song of descent. We can only meet God by ascending all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">STILL A HANDFUL</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Anxious one, why hold that handful?<br />Let the prophet first be filled.<br />Your finances, if God handles,<br />How can your supply run dry?<br />Fresh necessities come daily,<br />Daily there are fresh supplies.<br />Since you are His own creation,<br />Will He not for you design?<br />Still you're loving, and still giving,<br />Still there is a handful left.<br />For all love and all your giving,<br />Many-fold He'll give you more.<br /><br /></li><li>O believe! He'll not delay you,<br />Ne'er too quick is He, nor slow.<br />O believe! The cruse, ne'er empty,<br />Nor will it be dry, nor filled.<br />Though the lilies lack their clothing,<br />Though the birds may not have food,<br />Yet the widow's little barrel,<br />Always has a handful still.<br /><br /></li><li>Why need worry for tomorrow,<br />When there's now enough to share?<br />Why need borrow next day's trouble,<br />When we have our handful still?<br />Love is living; giving's saving;<br />Those who sow much reap much more.<br />When you think that all is emptied,<br />Look, there is a handful still.</li></ol><p>This hymn is based on the story in 1 Kings 17. In our concept we do not care for the prophets. We think that taking care of the prophet is God's problem, God's business. But here the prophet is put into the hymn, which means that the prophet is also the business of God's people.</p><p>Those who have not handed themselves over will worry what to do next. But once you have handed yourselves over, you will see that God is responsible for the rest. We give the first half to the prophet, and God gives the second half to us. This hymn is God's answer for the second half. Actually, though the widow supplied the prophet first, she herself did not suffer hunger. All she did was to pour out the oil and empty the meal a few more times. God said that the first handful should be set aside for His use and that the second handful should be set aside for her own use. The third handful is again for God's use, and the fourth handful for her own use. The first, third, fifth, seventh, and so forth, are for God, and the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and so forth, take care of us. If the widow did not have faith, she might say, "Here is a person who has been starving for three and a half years. What if he helps himself to it and eats all my portion?'' However, if we would give the first portion to God, God will give the second portion to us. The same principle applies to our daily living today. God will not allow our cruse to be lacking in oil or our barrel to be lacking in meal. But neither will He allow us to have an excess. Hence, we see that there is no need to save up anything.</p><p>The second stanza is quite high. It starts out with "O believe.'' We should believe. What should we believe in? We should believe that at no time will we be empty, and that at no time will we be filled. There will always be a handful left. If we have much, we may still worry that we do not have enough. But God gives to us in abundance. Yet He does not give everything to us all at once. Instead, He gives to us handful by handful.</p><p>The third stanza tells us that we should look to God concerning what He wants to do tomorrow. For all those who give, the result will actually be saving. When we spend, we think that what is spent is gone. Actually, nothing will be exhausted. No one will find himself giving to God to such an extent that he has nothing left. If the widow had not committed herself to God, she would not have lived through that three and a half years.</p><p>Today man's eyes are always set on the money in his hands. In 1 Timothy 6, the warning Paul gave was a despairing warning. He exhorted the believers not to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches. The best exhortation tells people to set their hope in God. But when the best exhortation no longer works, we have the next best exhortation, which tells people not to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches. But no matter how much a man sets his hope on the uncertainty of riches, he still has to turn around to set his hope on God in the end. Since this is the case, why not set one's hope in God in the first place?</p><h2 class="head1">A TALK TO THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS<br />AND WHO HAVE HANDED THEMSELVES OVER</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Being Unequally Yoked<br />with the Unbelievers</h2><p>Tonight we have something to say to the brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed themselves over. We have gathered together you brothers who have handed yourselves over in order to have some fellowship with you. Before you handed yourselves over, there may have been some people whom you had business dealings with. Presently, you may also have some unbelieving business partners. At a certain time, these relationships will have to be terminated, because your goal and their goals are not the same. Sooner or later there will be conflicts of interests. We hope that you will do your best to separate yourselves from them within a short time.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Coordinate One with Another</h2><p>The second thing is that you have to learn to coordinate with one another. The money you earn is for God, and the money I earn is also for God. We have to learn to be delivered from our individual circles. What I have personally is not a concern of my own, but a concern of the Body. These concerns should be considered within the coordination. Formerly, your goal was for yourselves. Now your goal is changed, and this puts all of us together in the same place.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING FROM THE FAILURE OF THE PAST</h2><p>Witness Lee: Concerning going into business, we had some experiences in the past. First, in the beginning everyone shared everything in common. After a while, each one began to have some possessions and works of his own, and some degradation set in with respect to money. Still later, the brothers and sisters began to form partnerships in investments and business enterprises, and the situation became even worse. According to my knowledge, not once did we see a good result when brothers went into business together. Cases of arbitration and settlement were especially frequent among the brothers. This is why I advised everyone not to go into business ventures together. Instead, it is better that they should engage in business alone.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM RICHES</h2><p>Despite what I said, we frequently saw that some have capital but are unable to operate a business, whereas others can operate a business but do not have the capital. In some cases a person has both but does not have the strength to do anything. In the past we did not have enough light. As a result, when the brothers came together, it was difficult for them to be without opinion. Once opinion came in, the testimony was lost, and what was done was not done to the glory of God. We could not handle the matter properly because we were not delivered from riches yet. Because of this, there was no coordination among us, and we became poor. As far as the work is concerned, we are the poorest among all Christian groups. Today I sent out fifteen to sixteen hundred letters to the brothers and sisters to fellowship with them about the purchase of the meeting hall. I was not happy in my heart about this matter. Our present meeting hall is already packed to the brim. Our present meeting hall will not meet even a fraction of the present need. All the while, however, we are telling the saints to bring others to our gospel meetings. Where are they going to sit if they all come?</p><p>Today we are poor. But what is the reason that we are so poor? The reason is that money has been kept back in our own hands. We have become so fallen that all our hands have become empty again. The work has no money, and you have no money. The reason for our poverty is that we have not been delivered from riches yet. When the money goes into your pocket, your heart falls in love with money. The minute we start arguing, all blessings are gone. You said that you have handed yourselves over, and you have listed all your possessions. But when I read the lists over and over again, I find nothing that can be taken up by us.</p><p>The amount of spiritual need should be matched by the amount of material supply. It is still right for us to go into business. But in order to do that, we must first hand over our individualism. Perhaps some brothers disagree with going into business together. But how much can one person's capital do? The move of the gospel must catch up with the need of the age. In order to catch up with the age, there is the need for coordination. In the world men conduct business by taking an airplane and by doing it on a large scale. But we have not given our time to anything. When we preach the gospel, we do not have any advertisements, and we do not do anything in the newspaper. The reason for this is that we do not have the money. If the brothers who are in business realize the great need in the gospel, they should rise up to do something in an aggressive way. All that the brothers need to do is to keep enough for their own use; the rest should be offered up to the work. If we do not offer up ourselves in this way, there is not much hope that we can go on.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF MONEY TO MATCH<br />THE NEED OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Watchman Nee: According to statistics compiled by evangelists around the world, the more money a person puts into the gospel work, the more people there are who will be baptized. They calculated that on an average a person has to spend one thousand U.S. dollars on a person before he can be saved. But it takes a very small amount of money to have people saved among us. Although I cannot say that of one thousand people saved among us, every one of them counts, I can say that at least nine hundred ninety-nine of them count. If we have one thousand U.S. dollars, we can save one hundred people. It does not mean that there is no money in Christianity today. It means that people do not get saved as quickly as they do among us.</p><p>The money in Christianity today comes from foreign countries. Let me ask you: Where does that money come from? Does it not come from God's children also? It is better for us to give some money to them than for them to send some money to us. But where does our money come from? It comes from all the poor brothers and sisters. Those who should give do not give, and those who should not give continue to give. Up to a point, when I received the money, I felt unable to take it. That money was like the water of Bethlehem; it is water that we cannot drink (2 Sam. 23:13-17). One student offered four million dollars. Although a person cannot even buy a sack of rice for four million dollars now, this student had to save his bus fare and go on foot to come up with this amount for his offering. Do not think that God's worker will take any kind of money that is offered up. We are like David. Although we may be thirsty, we cannot drink that kind of water. That kind of water has to be poured out before God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A MORE THOROUGH CONSECRATION</h2><p>The difficulty of our work today lies in the fact that we lack both people and money. Presently, we have seven brothers who have left their jobs. We also have over twenty widows of former co-workers among us. I can see two brothers who really should have left their jobs. Yet I cannot help them to leave their jobs, because in the past I have asked some co-workers to leave their jobs, and not long after that, they died. It was as if I had sent them to their graves. Among our co-workers who have died, other than one who died of cholera, the one who was killed by the Communists, and the two others who died of other diseases, the rest died of tuberculosis. You who are sitting here are saved because we have spent money on you. Even if you were saved in another place and then came to us for perfection, we have spent money on you. Even if it means sacrificing your life, you have to give your money away to allow others to hear the gospel and to share the good that you have received. If this generation will give up everything, it will pave the way for the next generation to go on. This is how the way of the gospel is paved. In the north and in the south, a few dozen brothers are ready to give themselves full-time for the gospel. On the one hand, we may say that it is not that easy for the work to go on. On the other hand, we find that it is very simple for men to be saved among us, and the price we have to pay is very little. As soon as a person touches the gospel, he is saved. For this reason, we need to have more thorough consecrations.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">TESTIMONIES BY THE SAINTS<br />AND WORDS OF EXHORTATION</h1><h2 class="head4">(Church Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 8, 1948, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>(Editor's Note: Testimonies were given by all the brothers and sisters who had handed over themselves. At the end of the meeting, Watchman Nee gave a word of exhortation.)</p><p>For over twenty years God has been taking the way of recovery among us. This way is becoming clearer and clearer. Today everyone who holds back anything for himself is either a sad person or a weeping person. Within the last few days, I have met some of the happiest people I have ever seen. Many people held my hands tightly, and they were both excited and happy. Praise God, there are many happy faces here today. They have all handed themselves wholeheartedly to the Lord. Tonight it is as if the last train is about to leave. I hope that no one will miss this train and that no one will be left behind.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THE CHURCH AND THE WORK,<br />THE MEANING AND AUTHORITY<br />OF THE CHURCH, AND<br />IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: May 15, 1948, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speaker: Watchman Nee</h1><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP<br />BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">The Church Being Local<br />and the Work Being Regional</h2><p>The sphere of the church is a locality, and the sphere of the work is a region. A church is local. That is why we have the church in Ephesus, the church in Colossae, and the church in Corinth. But the work is more than local. The book of Acts shows us that the first group of workers went from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to all the other places. These workers were not limited to the locality of Jerusalem, but they were limited to the region of Judea. Hence, this shows us that their work was regional.</p><p>At Antioch there was a new beginning. There we see Paul and Barnabas going out to start the work among the Gentiles. In the Gentile world there were the churches in Galatia and the churches in Asia. These churches form one region. Hence, in the Bible there is not only the company of Peter preaching the gospel; there is also the company of Barnabas preaching the gospel. Philippians even speaks of another group of people (1:15-17) working in a different region. Paul said that the measure apportioned to him allowed him to reach even as far as the Corinthians (2 Cor. 10:13-14). In other words, Paul had his region of work.</p><h2 class="head2">Work Being Divided into Regions,<br />but the Fellowship Being One</h2><p>There are regions to the work, and each region includes certain localities. Under normal circumstances, though the regions are different, there is still a oneness between the regions. When the relationship is normal, all the works in the different regions maintain the one fellowship. Jerusalem is one with Antioch. Although they belong to different regions, they still have fellowship before the Lord. When people were saved in Antioch, Jerusalem sent some men over to help (Acts 11:20-28). Jerusalem also sent out Barnabas and Paul (9:28-30). Antioch was something that came out of Jerusalem and returned back to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent money from the Gentiles to Jerusalem (11:27-29). Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch (v. 22), and Paul returned from Antioch to Jerusalem (15:2). Here we see that although regions are different, the fellowship remains one.</p><h2 class="head2">The Elders Being Responsible for the Church,<br />and the Apostles Being Responsible for the Work</h2><p>The elders are responsible for the church in a locality (Titus 1:5), whereas the apostles are responsible for the work in a region. Peter and his co-workers were in charge of the work in Judea, whereas Paul and his co-workers were in charge of Antioch and the work in the Gentile world. The apostles worked within the regions assigned to them by God (2 Cor. 10:13).</p><h2 class="head2">How to Handle Finances</h2><p>How should we handle the church finances? All the money that the brothers and sisters designate for a local church should be placed in the church offering box. Whatever is designated for the poor brothers should be marked clearly. Whatever is designated for individuals or for the work in another region should likewise be clearly marked. You can separate the offerings for local use and for the work by using two offering boxes, or the two can go into the same offering box. The church has full liberty to distribute these offerings in whatever way it chooses, and individuals have full liberty to give according to their faith.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Two Aspects of the Church</h2><p>Witness Lee: What is the meaning and the sphere of the church?</p><p>Watchman Nee: There are two meanings to the word church. The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church. The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday and today, both here and elsewhere. It even includes the church in the future. The local church is the church that appears in each locality.</p><h2 class="head2">The Two Aspects of the Universal Church</h2><p>There are two aspects to the universal church. One aspect refers to the church that includes all of God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere. However, we have to realize that today we are neither in yesterday nor in the future. God's children are living on earth today. When all these children of God are added together, we also have the general church. What was there yesterday is past, and what will be there in the future is not here yet. Between the past and the future, there are all the children of God on earth today. God's children must not only practice the oneness in the locality, but they must learn to be one with all God's children on the whole earth today.</p><h2 class="head2">Maintaining the Local Testimony<br />and God's Testimony on Earth As Well</h2><p>If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth. We must not only maintain a local testimony; we must also maintain God's testimony on earth. We cannot isolate Shanghai and try to keep it out of trouble. Shanghai belongs to the general church on earth. The Body spoken of in 1 Corinthians is different from the Body spoken of in Ephesians 4. The Body in Ephesians 4 includes all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, but the Body in 1 Corinthians only refers to all the believers on earth at that time.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Be One</h2><p>The church is local, whereas the work is regional. A local church cannot encompass the work of a region, because a region involves more than one local church. However, all the local churches plus all the regional works equal the general church. In order for us to practice the oneness of the church, we must practice the oneness of the general church. This requires that we learn to follow others and learn to be one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Authority of the Church<br />Being with the Elders, whereas the Authority<br />of the Work Being with the Apostles</h2><p>Witness Lee: What is the authority of the church, and who can represent the church?</p><p>Watchman Nee: The authority of the local church is in the hands of the elders, whereas the authority of the work is in the hands of the apostles.</p><h2 class="head2">Oneness with the General Church<br />Bringing in Authority</h2><p>Since you are the church, you have the authority. God's authority is with the church. Do not think that an individual believer does not have any authority. As long as an individual believer is one with the general church, he can have authority also, and he can even be the authority. Suppose Brother Lee has offended me. While I am alone with him, I point out his mistake, and the matter is taken care of. While I am taking care of the matter, the church is brought in; the reality of the church is brought in. Of course, in terms of the actual procedure, the church is not involved. In the Bible not only can an individual represent the church; the principle of two or three can also be a principle of the church. When two or three are one, that oneness makes them the church. When these two or three deal with anything, it will be the church dealing with the matter. The only difference between that and the church actually dealing with the matter is that the church has not said anything directly. In actuality, these two or three are one with the church, but the church is not directly involved. However, what they say becomes what the church says. Hence, the two or three become the church.</p><p>Here we can see a unique fact of oneness: An individual can have the authority of the church, two or three can have the authority of the church, and the whole church can also have the authority of the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Authority of the Apostles</h2><p>Other than these authorities, we see before the Lord that God has established some special authorities. These authorities have to give an account before God in the future. First, God established the elders as the authority. God has also established the apostles as the authority. Accusations against an elder should be presented to the apostles (1 Tim. 5:19). The elders are the authorities, and the apostles are also the authorities. Moreover, the elders have to submit to the authority of the apostles. A man should learn coordination before God.</p><h2 class="head2">Submitting to the Authority<br />Assigned by the Head</h2><p>We believe that a man should submit to the authority of the Head in the church. A believer should learn submission in the church to such an extent that his submission means more than his sacrifice. We should look for opportunities to submit. Every believer should practice submission. If they do this, others will see that there is a group of people who bear a proper testimony in the schools, the hospitals, and so forth. Here is a group of people who have not overstepped and who maintain their proper standing. In the homes you do not see the children dominating the parents or strong wives dominating their husbands. If we have the light, we will see that God hates confusion (1 Cor. 14:33). Whether or not we like it, we have to recognize authority. Once there is authority, there is submission. When we hand ourselves over, not only do we have to offer up our money, but we have to learn coordination as well. We have to pursue submission, not only to the Lord, but to those whom the Lord has placed in our path. If we do this, we will find grace before God, and we will be able to go on in a proper way. As long as there are four or five brothers living together, some have to learn to exercise headship, and some have to learn submission. Whenever man fails to recognize the sovereign arrangements of the Head, everything falls into confusion. Whenever we find submission, we find a proper testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF BEING ONE WITH THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">The Church Not Being a Matter of Numbers</h2><p>A brother asked: A while ago you said that an individual brother can be one with the church, and that once there is oneness, there is authority. What kind of oneness does that refer to?</p><p>Watchman Nee: This oneness is an identification. Strictly speaking, not only can one individual not call himself the church; even if all sixteen hundred saints in Shanghai are put together, it is equally presumptuous for them to call themselves the church. In Revelation 7, it speaks of those who are clothed in white and who stand before the throne as being countless in number. The largest number in the book of Revelation is two hundred million. This means that this countless number is larger than two hundred million. The population of China is only five hundred million, or more precisely, four hundred fifty million. If among all the Chinese, three thousand of them would set up a flag and declare that they are China, would that not be a joke? Hence, the church is not a matter of numbers.</p><h2 class="head2">There Being Oneness with the Church<br />Only by Being Dealt With<br />and by Being in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>If I am one who has been disciplined by the Holy Spirit and one who has learned the lesson of fellowship, and if I am one who rejects not only the self but all individualism, and if I am one who has been dealt with in all these areas, then I will surely be one with the church. No matter how large a number we have, when this number is compared with the whole, it is worth nothing. The question is whether or not we are the same as all the other children of God. If we are, we can say that we are the church. If not, even if we have sixteen hundred people, we cannot say that we are the church. When a man is in the Holy Spirit, he can be one with the church. When a man is not in the Holy Spirit, there is no oneness of the church. If there is no oneness of the church, even if the number is ten times sixteen hundred, there is still no church.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Dealt With to Have the Body Consciousness,<br />and Being Identified with the Body</h2><p>God wants our self to be broken. Individualism must go, and we cannot act according to our own will; our outward shell must be broken. The Body is a matter of consciousness. God has to bring a man to the point where he realizes that he is the church. This is what we mean by the Body consciousness. One has to be brought to the point where he feels that he is the Body. When one member of your body moves, the whole body moves as well. This is something very real. The Lord said to Paul, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads'' (Acts 26:14). Perhaps Paul only remembered that he persecuted Stephen. He did not realize that while he was persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord. Later, he understood that in persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord. This is why Paul later said that when one member suffers, the whole Body suffers (1 Cor. 12:26). When the whole Body is rejoicing, will not each member rejoice? When the whole Body is suffering, will not each member suffer also? We have to stand on the ground of a receiving one, and we should receive the other members of the Body. Pride goes before destruction (Prov. 16:18). Those who sit on the high chair of a judge can surely not be runners of the race. Only those who receive, who are humble, and who step down from their throne can identify themselves with others and with the church. Otherwise, any oneness is but an outward performance.</p><p>When a man is one with the church, if others are in the flow, he will surely be in the flow. When others receive a certain guidance, he will receive the same guidance. All the brothers and sisters will receive the same grace and take the same way. If everyone is hot, and you are the only one that is cold, it proves that you are not in the Body. If everyone is going in one direction, you have to follow them. If everyone is burdened for Manchuria, spontaneously you will have the same burden. If everyone is afraid of touching a certain matter, you will not dare to touch the same matter. This is the church. The church is something that issues from within. It is not something that is arrived at by outward consensus. Hence, every child of God is the church. If we follow the footsteps of the flock in this way, God will lead us on. We cannot withdraw ourselves simply because of our unwillingness to submit in certain matters, and we cannot fall behind or draw back. Among God's children the most precious thing is this sense of identification. If all God's children see something one way and I feel another way, I should resolve not to fall behind the others, and I should be ready to identify myself with others.</p><h2 class="head1">IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">Submission to the Discipline of the Holy Spirit<br />Bringing In Identification</h2><p>Yu Cheng-hwa: Is this identification the result of the work of the Holy Spirit? Why do we not say that we should be identified with the Head, but rather that we should be identified with the Body?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Identification is not a oneness of the will. For example, if the feeling within me is different from yours, we will not be the same no matter how much we try to talk things over with one another. Water is water, and wine is wine. One does not see the water turned into wine every day. Whenever we do not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit through our circumstances, we will fall behind in the matter of identification. When a platoon of soldiers is marching along, and one of them disobeys the captain, he will automatically become out of step with the rest of the platoon.</p><p>With Christians there is no such thing as circumstances; there is only the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Lord has given us His Spirit. Everything around us is under His sovereign arrangement, and nothing is a coincidence. What the Holy Spirit is doing within us matches what He has sovereignly arranged outside of us. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is for our good (Rom. 8:27-28). Whatever He sees that we need, He arranges these things outside of us. If a man does not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he will come into conflict with the brothers. If he is not under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, there is surely no possibility of identification, and he will not be able to identify himself with the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Identification with the Head Being Mystical,<br />whereas Identification with the Body<br />Being Practical</h2><p>The believers' identification with the Head is a doctrine that has been preached for years, but we have to say that the result is quite abstract. For example, I consecrate myself to the Lord today. Tomorrow I may take back my consecration, and nobody will know anything about it. This is mystical. Everything that is mystical has to be turned into something practical. Once something is turned from the mystical to the practical, it will no longer be so easy to dispense with the matter. For example, if a person has consecrated himself in a practical way, it will no longer be easy for him to take back his consecration. If he does, everyone will see that this brother has drawn back.</p><p>We have to realize that the oneness of the Body is something that is visible; it is not empty talk. In fact, if we are identified with the Head, we will surely be identified with the Body. When a person identifies himself with the Body, he is identifying himself with the Head. This is something visible and measurable. John said that if a man cannot love the brothers whom he has seen, he cannot love God whom he has not seen (1 John 4:20). It is impossible to have two persons submitting to the Head yet fighting with one another. I would rather declare that I am submitting to the Body than to declare in a falsely spiritual way that I have no problem with the Head and that I am submitting to the Head.</p><h2 class="head2">Identification with the Head<br />without Identification with the Body<br />Being to Live in Deceit</h2><p>We see men everywhere living in deceit. These ones should learn to go along with the church. If you go along with the church, you will be blessed. If a man identifies himself with the Body, he will surely be identified with the Head. But if a man says that he is identified with the Head yet does not identify himself with the Body, he is living in deceit.</p></body></html>
