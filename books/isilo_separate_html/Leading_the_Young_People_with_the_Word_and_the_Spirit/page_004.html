<p>Based on the disposition of young people to receive an education, we should use our spiritual materials effectively and teach them according to modern, instructional methods. In both the East and the West, educational systems utilize modern instructional methods, and we should do the same. While the material should be absolutely spiritual, the method of instruction should be modern.</p>
<p>For example, proficiency in mathematics requires a system of instruction. If an educator wants to teach the next generation a proper understanding of mathematics, he must consider the entire educational system; that is, he must consider what should be taught in elementary school, in junior high, in high school, in college, and even in graduate school. In this way he will be able to pass on mankind&rsquo;s accumulated knowledge of mathematics to the young ones of the next generation. This is true in regard to any field of knowledge, and this is the practice in modern educational systems.</p>
<p>We should adopt this way of instruction in regard to the spiritual material that we present to the young people, approaching it from the aspect of spiritual knowledge and of spiritual life. I hope that some brothers or sisters will work on compiling materials on knowledge and life. They also should consider the appropriate content for a young person in junior high, high school, or college. There should be a definite progression in the material. From the start of junior high to their graduation from college, we should use these ten years to infuse the content of our spiritual material into the next generation. I do not have the time to prepare such material. I can only present this to you in order to see if something can be worked out.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING MATERIAL FLEXIBLY</h2>
<p>Our young people&rsquo;s meetings need to address our lack of leading that is appropriate to various age groups. The leading for each age group should be different. Junior high students should be led in a way that is suitable to the junior high level, and high school and college students also should be led in their respective ways. Therefore, in our preparation of material for these respective age groups, we should be flexible. For example, an elementary student will learn a basic outline of history, but in junior high school, high school, and college, more historical details are added to their studies. Concerning the topic of the divinity of the Lord Jesus, junior high students may need only two verses from the Bible, while high school students can be given more verses. College students have the ability to consider this topic as it is presented throughout the entire Scriptures. Although the topic may be the same, the depth of the material should increase as the age of a young person increases. This is the principle of using material flexibly.</p>
<p>We should follow this principle when we cover material related to spiritual life. When we teach the junior high students to know the flesh, we should use material that is easy and simple. However, we should use deeper material with the brothers and sisters who are in college. Although we may be speaking about the same topic of knowing the flesh, the material that we use with each group should vary in weight, depth, and quantity. We should use material flexibly.</p>
<p>Even though we know that we need to use modern instructional methods, it is still difficult to have proper material. We should consider the progression of the topics to cover. The skills required to prepare this material is a major issue as well. It would be very good if some saints received a burden to compile this material, because there is indeed such a need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS AND DIRECTION OF THE MATERIAL</h2>
<p>The young people&rsquo;s meeting can stress matters related to spiritual knowledge one week and to spiritual life the next. It does not matter which aspect is covered first. Nevertheless, the material must be given in the way of education, and the person who speaks must also exercise his spirit. Young people need to receive material in the way of education, and in order to understand the material, there should also be exercises. This is the new way of education. Our exercises must be more serious than those in the schools. The young people meet once a week, and our time with them is precious. Hence, we should teach them seriously. We do not need to teach them many things at once, but what we teach should be thorough.</p>
<p>Concerning instruction in matters related to spiritual knowledge, it is profitable for junior high students to read the books in the Bible sequentially. However, it is more profitable to lead them to study the Bible according to topics. Spiritual knowledge can be divided into four major topics: Christ, redemption, life, and the church. The entire Bible is focused on these four points. All the verses in the Bible can be classified according to these four topics. These four topics can also be linked by one sentence: Christ came to accomplish redemption so that man may have life for the producing of the church. All our instruction related to spiritual knowledge should convey these four points. We can even use these four points to compile a curriculum for junior high, high school, and college students, leading them to know Christ, redemption, life, and the church.</p>
<p>Regarding our leading of the young people in matters related to spiritual life, we can speak according to the four stages of spiritual life. The first stage is the salvation stage&mdash;our being in Christ. The second stage is the revival stage&mdash;our abiding in Christ. The third stage is the stage of the cross&mdash;Christ living in us. The fourth stage is the stage of spiritual warfare&mdash;Christ being fully grown in us (see <em>The Experience of Life</em>). This is a brief sketch. The important points in life are very fine, but we cannot speak of them in detail now.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
