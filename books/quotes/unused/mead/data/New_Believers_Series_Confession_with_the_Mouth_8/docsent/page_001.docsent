   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFESSION WITH THE MOUTH Scripture Reading: Rom 10:10; Prov 29:25; Matt 10:32-33 I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CONFESSING WITH THE MOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once a person has believed in the Lord, he should not keep the matter a secret; he has to confess the Lord with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Confessing the Lord with our mouth is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Opening the Mouth as Soon as One Believes</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as one believes in the Lord, he should confess the Lord before men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose a person gives birth to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What would we think if the child could not speak by the age of one or two, or even three?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Would we say only that he is slow in speech development?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is it possible for such a person to begin saying, "one, two, three, four," at the age of thirty and then learn to say "daddy" and "mommy" at fifty years of age?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No. If a person is dumb in his infancy, he probably will be dumb for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he cannot say "daddy" and "mommy" when he is young, he probably will not be able to say it for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, if a new believer does not confess the Lord immediately after he believes in the Lord, I am afraid he will be dumb for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he cannot speak when he is young, he probably will not be able to speak when he grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some have been Christians for ten or even twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet they remain dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because they did not open their mouth during the first and second week of their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They will continue to be dumb until they die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Confessing the Lord begins at the time a person believes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you open your mouth the day you believe in the Lord, the way of confession will be opened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person is dumb in the first weeks, months, or year, he is likely to remain dumb for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, as soon as a person believes in the Lord, he should endeavor to speak to others about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if he finds it hard to speak and even if he dislikes speaking, he still must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must speak to his relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he does not learn to speak openly, I am afraid he will be a dumb man before God for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not wish to see dumb believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we must learn to open our mouth from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person fails to do this in the beginning, he will find it more difficult to do it later.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unless God grants special mercy or there is a revival, these ones will never open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will take a great effort for them to open their mouth at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every new believer should seek the opportunity to confess the Lord before men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a confession is a great matter and reaps much profit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Confession with the Mouth unto Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 10:10 says, "For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"With the heart there is believing unto righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is something before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"With the mouth there is confession unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This speaks of salvation before man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether or not you have believed is something before God; no one can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have sincerely believed, you are justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if you only believe in your heart, but do not speak with your mouth, others will not recognize you as a saved person; they will still consider you an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They will not see any difference between you and them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the Bible strongly stresses the need to confess with the mouth in addition to believing in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must speak with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every new believer must look for opportunities to confess the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Among our classmates, colleagues, friends, relatives, and all those who come into contact with us, as soon as an opportunity arises, we should say to them, "I have believed in the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sooner we open our mouth, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we open our mouth, others will immediately know that we have believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, we will be delivered from the company of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen some people who hesitated in their acceptance of the Lord, but once they stood up and proclaimed, "I believe in Jesus," they became sure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The worst thing that can happen to a Christian is for him to keep his mouth shut.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once he speaks, he takes a firm step forward and becomes secure.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many believers hesitate initially, but as soon as they say, "I believe," they become certain.</S>
