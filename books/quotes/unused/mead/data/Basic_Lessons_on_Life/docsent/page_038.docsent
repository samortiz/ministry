   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ISSUE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now that we have seen the way to be regenerated, we want to see the issue of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Resurrected with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first issue of regeneration is that we are resurrected with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 1:3b says that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 2:5a says that God made us alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ was resurrected, we were also resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From God's viewpoint we were resurrected together with Christ and regenerated through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is realized by us experientially and applied to us when we are regenerated in time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the result of our regeneration is that we are resurrected with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Having the Eternal and Uncreated Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we were regenerated, God put His eternal and uncreated life into our being 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Becoming a Child of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since God has put His life into us, we have become children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 1:12 says that we have the authority to be the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This authority is the life God put into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The very life God put into us is our right, our authority, for us to be children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. Partaking of the Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regeneration results in the partaking of God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we are born of God, surely as His children we have not only His life but also His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Peter 1:4 says that we are partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Born into the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since we are born of God, spontaneously we are born into the realm of God, into the sphere of God, that is, into the kingdom of God John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the result, the issue, of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to emphasize the focus of this lesson, which is expressed in the following statement: to be regenerated is to have the life of God that we may be His children living in His kingdom according to His divine nature.</S>
