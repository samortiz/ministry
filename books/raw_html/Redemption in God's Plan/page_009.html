        <h2 class="head2">The Woman Assuming the Headship</h2>
<p>When the subtle one went to the woman, she fell into his trap because she assumed the headship in dealing with him (Gen. 3:2-3, 6). The first step in man&rsquo;s fall was the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship. This is a terrible thing. Even before the woman ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she fell into the stratagem of the evil one by assuming the headship over the man. This was her mistake. As a result, she was deceived. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Talking with Satan</h2>
<p>The second step in man&rsquo;s fall was to talk with Satan. The best way to handle Satan&rsquo;s questions is to ignore them. If we respond to his questions, we will surely be fooled. Satan asks questions in order to tempt us to talk with him. Eve was deceived by the serpent because she answered his question and talked with him (Gen. 3:2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Satan&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>As a result of talking with the serpent, Eve received his word. A person&rsquo;s words represent not only his intention but also his life and person. The Lord&rsquo;s words are His life, and God&rsquo;s word is God (John 6:63; 1:1). By receiving Satan&rsquo;s word, Eve received not only his intention but also his life and person. When we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, we receive the Lord&rsquo;s life and are joined to the Lord. Likewise, when we receive Satan&rsquo;s word, we receive his life and are joined to him. Satan entered into man even before man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan entered into man when Eve received his word. As soon as Eve received Satan&rsquo;s word, his life entered into man, and man was illicitly united with Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Controlled by Satan&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>After entering into Eve, Satan&rsquo;s word took control of her and caused her to look at and desire the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:6). Eve received Satan&rsquo;s word into her mind. This word controlled her, made her look at the tree, and caused her heart to delight in the tree. This put a desire within her to gain the knowledge of good and evil in order to be just like God. As a result, lust and pride rose up in her being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eating the Fruit of the Tree<br />
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>When Eve was controlled by the serpent&rsquo;s word to look at the tree of knowledge with her eyes and to desire it in her heart, she took its fruit with her hand and ate it (v. 6). Those who take in Satan&rsquo;s word will be controlled by his word and will fulfill his proposals. Eve was not an exception. She took in Satan&rsquo;s word and was controlled by his word. According to his proposal, she ate the fruit that God had commanded man not to eat.</p>
<p>Eve ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge and also gave it to her husband to eat (v. 6). This was the purpose of the evil one. Satan tempted Eve to eat the fruit of the tree so that her husband would eat the fruit. It was hard for Satan to deceive the man, but it was easier for him to gain man through the woman. Women are often the means through which men sin. When a wife sins, she often causes her husband to commit the same sin. Satan leads men into sin through women.</p>
<p>When Adam followed his wife to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he sinned and fell. Thus, Satan&rsquo;s stratagem to deceive and usurp man was successful. As a result, man was one with Satan and entered into an illicit relationship and union with him. The man who was appointed by God to guard the garden of Eden was eventually stolen by God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSEQUENCES OF MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s sin and fall have consequences. The consequences of man&rsquo;s fall are serious, tragic, and dreadful. The Bible reveals at least five consequences of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Record of Sin</h2>
<p>Although God commanded man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man disobeyed God&rsquo;s command. As a result, man became unlawful before God. Man was condemned by God because he had committed a sinful deed, and he now had a record of sin (Rom. 5:16, 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Nature of Sin</h2>
<p>When man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he violated God&rsquo;s command, and Satan and his life entered into man.</p>
<p>Man used his mind, emotion, and will to receive Satan&rsquo;s word; hence, Satan&rsquo;s word entered into every part of man&rsquo;s soul. Words represent the intentions of a speaker and also the speaker&rsquo;s life and person. When man received Satan&rsquo;s word, man received Satan&rsquo;s intention, life, and person. From that time, the three parts of man&rsquo;s soul have been defiled by Satan.</p>
<p>When man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the life of that tree entered into man&rsquo;s body. The life of the tree of knowledge signifies the life of Satan; hence, the life of Satan entered into man&rsquo;s body. This life became the &ldquo;sin&rdquo; that dwells in man (7:17, 20). This sin is also called &ldquo;the evil&rdquo; (v. 21), and it is the law of sin in our members (v. 23).</p>
<p>To eat is to receive something into our being. When Adam sinned, he not only did something unlawful; he also took something evil into his being. When he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the life of Satan entered into him. The most critical point in man&rsquo;s fall is that Satan&rsquo;s evil life entered into man.</p>
<p>Man received this evil life in such a way that it became his own element. By eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man was joined to this life. Thus, Satan and man were united. When man fell, Satan entered into man and was joined with man. As a result, fallen man has Satan&rsquo;s life, and Satan is in man.</p>
<p>Man was created pure and clean. After man fell, he was no longer pure and clean. Instead, he was defiled by Satan because he had Satan&rsquo;s life. As a result, man&rsquo;s body was transmuted, mixed, and filthy.</p>
<p>On the one hand, when man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he violated God&rsquo;s law and established a record of sin. This was outward. On the other hand, when man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature entered into man. As a result, man has a sinful nature and has been constituted a sinner (5:19). This is inward. With regard to God&rsquo;s law, man has a record of sin and thus stands condemned before God. With regard to man&rsquo;s condition, man possesses the nature of sin and has the tendency to sin. Hence, man commits sinful deeds outwardly and has a sinful life and nature inwardly. There is an objective consequence to man&rsquo;s fall and also a subjective consequence. Objectively, man is under God&rsquo;s condemnation as a result of his sinful act. Subjectively, man continues to sin as a result of his sinful life and nature.</p>
<p>For example, I may tell a brother not to pour black ink into a cup of plain water. But if, out of curiosity, he pours the ink into the water, he will violate my command. However, by pouring black ink into a cup of plain water, he also will change the plain water into black water. This example can be applied to man. First, man violated God&rsquo;s command, and second, something &ldquo;black&rdquo;&mdash;Satan&rsquo;s sinful life&mdash;was added into his pure and clean being, transmuting his nature from white to black.</p>
<p>God created man as a clean vessel for His life, but before God could put His holy life into this clean vessel, man was tempted by Satan and received Satan&rsquo;s filthy life. As a result, man not only offended God outwardly but also became corrupted inwardly.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s purpose in tempting man to sin was not only to make man sin against God outwardly but also to corrupt and defile man inwardly. By causing man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan injected his sinful, filthy life into man. This sinful, filthy life includes all the dark elements that are against God. This can be likened to poison being added to a cup of clean, pure water before vitamins can be added. God created man in a pure condition so that He could mingle His life with man. But before God could be mingled with man, His enemy injected his poisonous life into man. Man was tempted and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Man&rsquo;s inward, subjective problem is as serious as his outward, objective problem. The inward, subjective consequence is as serious as his outward, objective consequence.</p>
<p>Before the fall man had only the human life, but after the fall his human life was mixed with Satan&rsquo;s life. People commit sinful acts, such as fornicating, gambling, smoking, hating, murdering, coveting, and stealing, because our human life is mixed with Satan&rsquo;s life, which is &ldquo;the sin&rdquo; within us. These sinful acts are not committed merely by our human life. These sinful deeds are the result of indwelling sin; Satan&rsquo;s life stirs, directs, and compels people to commit sin (7:17, 20). The consequence of man&rsquo;s fall is that Satan&rsquo;s evil life is now in us as indwelling sin.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
