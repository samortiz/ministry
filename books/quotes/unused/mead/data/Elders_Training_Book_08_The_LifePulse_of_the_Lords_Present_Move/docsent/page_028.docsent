   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN FULL-TIME Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; Acts 20:34; 18:3; 1 Cor 9:6-15; Phil 4:13-19; 1 Tim 5:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The matter of being full-time has been very much misunderstood for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The common thought in Christianity is that being a preacher or a pastor is a kind of profession.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to be hired and people either pay you or they may fire you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the New Testament, however, to be a full-timer should not be to take a kind of profession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PRESENTING OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 12:1 says, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, for one to present his body to God is to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not go full-time, how could your body be free to be presented to God as a living sacrifice?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our entire being is contained in our body, and our body is confined in our time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the body is the center of these two things, the center of our being and the center of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The being is what we are, and the time is where we exist.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can change the places where we live, but we cannot move ourselves out of time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You always remain in time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To present your body to God means you give yourself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to be full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We Christians should all be full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to give ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not give ourselves to anything else, only to our saving God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SCATTERED FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider those approximately eight thousand saints in Jerusalem who were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 8:1 says that beside the apostles, all of the disciples were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They went out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Were they not full-timers?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were scattered not to do a job, but Acts tells us they were scattered to spread the glad tidings 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe their number was at least eight thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day three thousand were saved 2:41 , and another day five thousand 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They all were scattered to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What were they?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They all were full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were scattered throughout all of Judea and they also reached Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was a fulfillment of the Lord s word in Acts 1:8: But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was accomplished not through preachers or apostles but through the scattered full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PAUL MAKING TENTS TO SUPPORT HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND HIS CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity considers that Paul was a preacher, but Acts 18:3 tells us that he was in a trade making tents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul went purposely to stay with his co-workers, Priscilla and Aquila, because they were in the same trade.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Probably they made tents together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul not only made money to support himself, he also made money to support his co-workers Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THOSE WHO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>LIVING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians 9:14 tells us that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fifty years ago in Chefoo, we began to have the church life without any hired preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A friend of mine who was a generation older than I and highly educated argued.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said, What s wrong for a person to be paid as a preacher?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible says whoever preaches the gospel lives of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Apparently his word was right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Paul does not say that the preacher of the gospel is paid by somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He says that he lives of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because no one supported Paul, however, he had to make tents.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church in Corinth, whom he served, thought he took advantage of them, that he was a person of guile 2 Cor 12:16 and note 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, he did not use his right to live of the gospel with the saints in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He preached the gospel, yet lived on his tent making.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul illustrated his right to live of the gospel in several ways.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He likened his apostolic ministry to that of a soldier, a farmer, a shepherd, an ox on a threshing field, and a priest serving God by offering sacrifices for the people 1 Cor 9:7-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He illustrated in these many ways to vindicate himself, proving that he did have the right to live of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But due to the wrong environment in Corinth, he would not use that right.</S>
