   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GREATER TEMPLE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRESENT DAVID,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE LORD OF THE SABBATH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us consider the case in Matthew 12:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While the religious people were keeping the Sabbath in the temple, synagogues, or homes, the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to the wheat field to gather wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Pharisees saw them picking and eating the grains.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How did it happen that the Pharisees were there?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were the "Sabbath patrol," out on patrol, trying to find the Lord Jesus and His disciples breaking the Sabbath law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, they caught the Lord and His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For more details, read Christ versus Religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those poor religious Pharisees would prefer to keep people hungry in order to observe the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real meaning of the Sabbath is rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To keep the Sabbath is to have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if you are suffering from hunger, the religious people would force you to observe the Sabbath regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you were hungry, and the religious people compelled you to keep the Sabbath laws, would that be a rest or a suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No doubt it would be a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the religious ones do not care about the suffering; they only care for the Sabbath regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To keep these regulations is to make yourself heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we can understand the word of the Lord Jesus in Matthew 11:28: "Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only were the disciples hungry on that Sabbath day, but the men on the Sabbath patrol were also hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But they dared not to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They kept the Sabbath, yet they were suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means they were heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus wants the heavily burdened ones to come to Him so that He can give them rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How will He give them rest?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By breaking the Sabbath!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will give them rest by breaking the laws that cause them to be heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way to find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians quote Matthew 11:28-30 without connecting them to the previous verses or to the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they preach the gospel they use these verses, telling the hearers that they are heavily burdened with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Strictly speaking, however, to be "heavily burdened" in this verse is not to be heavily burdened with sins, but with religion, regulations, rules, rituals, and laws.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to be unloaded.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to be emancipated and released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be released is to be in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom is not enslavement; it is emancipation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The kingdom of Satan is slavery; the kingdom of the heavens is emancipation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you enter into the kingdom of the heavens, you will be completely unloaded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will be fully released, liberated, and emancipated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will enjoy the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No longer will you be enslaved to regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the kingdom we have the living Lord Jesus without any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Truly this is our emancipation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As kingdom people, how many regulations do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be able to say, "We have no regulations, but we do have the living Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a release this is to us!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose the brothers living in a brothers' house compiled a list of twenty-four regulations and posted it on the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a young brother came to live in that house, he would feel a heavy burden to keep all the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He would have to memorize them and recite them and attempt to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not expect to see any such list in the brothers' house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not like to see regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I like to see a living Person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the brothers' house there should be only one living Person no regulations.</S>
