But the father told the slaves to bring the best robe out quickly and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. This shows us that salvation demonstrates God's riches and not our poverty. There are some preachers who have been preaching for many years, who still do not understand salvation. Salvation tells us how rich God is. Many times, we think that we are not worthy. When we are somewhat awakened, we are not sure if God will forgive us when we call on Him. It seems as if someone like us has no ground to call on Him at all. But I have to say that our eyes are set on the wrong thing. A rich man has untold riches; he does not think about how much his son has spent but about how much he can give to his son for him to spend.</P><P>Let me give an illustration here; it may not be the most appropriate illustration. Once I met a rich man's son. I tried my best to persuade him to repent and believe in the Lord. One day he took me to his father. I told the father not to stop the son from believing in the Lord, and that if the son believed in the Lord, he would not spend his father's money carelessly anymore. But he said, "What I have is money. I am not afraid of his spending my money." He was not concerned about his son spending too much of his money. In the same way, our God is not concerned that we would spend too much. We think that God has only one hundred dollars and that we need one hundred and one dollars. We are always afraid that after we have spent everything, nothing will be left. But what our Father has is "money"; do not try to limit God. We should realize that salvation tells us how rich God is; it tells us that God has enough for us to spend again and again.</P><P>Some may think, "I am not able to overcome a certain sin. I have exhausted all means." But can we say to God that He cannot do anything regarding our particular sin? Many times we do not behave well as a Christian; we become weak and sinful, and our conscience tells us that our condition is hopeless. But the conscience only tells us our condition, while the blood tells us the way that God deals with our condition. The conscience tells us how we are in ourselves, but the blood tells us how God deals with us. Our conscience has been sprinkled by the blood. We have not only the conscience and the blood in the basin, we have the blood sprinkled in our conscience. The blood is not separated from the conscience, and the conscience is not separated from the blood. Rather, we have a conscience sprinkled with the blood, a conscience which is whiter than snow and cannot be made whiter than it already is.</P><P>God also has a robe for us, and He is not afraid that we will sell it. He has a ring for us, and He is not afraid that we will pawn it. He has sandals for us, and He is not afraid that we will wear them out. God's children ought to be adorned well and appear attractive. God has enough for those of His household to spend.</P><P>Verse 23 says, "And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry." The robe, ring, and sandals in the previous verse are for the son alone to enjoy because a robe can only be upon one person, a ring can only be upon one hand, and a pair of sandals can only be upon one pair of feet. However, a fattened calf cannot be consumed by one person alone; rather, "let us eat and be merry." Let me give a new thought today, God can be merry! On the night I was saved, I was so happy. The more I considered, the happier I became, and the happier I became, the more I sang. Although I did not have a tune or a song, I could not care less. This is the joy of a sinner concerning his salvation. But this verse tells us that God can be merry also. It is the joy of God's salvation of man! When a sinner is saved, we think how happy he is. But we have not seen how happy God is when He saves a sinner. When we see this, we will understand God's heart.</P><P>Verse 29 says, "But he answered and said to his father, Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends." This was the word of the older son to the father. The heart of the older son was on the father's happy giving to the younger son. The younger son had spent all, yet the father was happy. The older son had fulfilled his duty in the father's house. His mistake was that he only wanted his father to make him happy. The father wanted the older son to go and join the merriment. Our God wants us to be merry with Him. We have to take care of His heart. The older son wanted a goat for his own merriment. But in everything that God does, He never gives anything to man to enjoy by himself; He always gives something with the intention that man would enjoy it together with Him.</P><P>Let us compare two things, the kissing and the feasting. The father fell on the neck of the son and kissed him affectionately. Such kissing caused the son to be happy and satisfied. When the son was kissed this way, he knew that his father had forgiven him and would no longer remember his sin. He received the freedom of forgiveness and was satisfied. At the same time, while the son was sitting at the feast, the father's heart was happy and satisfied because he had gained his son back. Many people do not realize that when a man is saved, God is happy. They think that God has saved them because of their strong pleading. They do not realize that God is happy to save. In saving men, God receives the joy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
