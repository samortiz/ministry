   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. To Be the Bride at the Marriage Feast of Christ and in the Millennium</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the overcomers, both the dead and the living, will be the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium Rev 19:7-9; 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the bride, consisting of the overcoming believers, will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words "His wife" in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church Eph 5:24-25, 31-32 , the bride of Christ John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, in verse .7 consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The readiness of the bride in 19:7 depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The overcomers are not only mature in life but are also built together as one bride.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Revelation 19:8 says, "It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Pure" refers to the nature, whereas "bright" refers to the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word translated "righteousnesses" may also be rendered "righteous acts."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These righteousnesses do not refer to the righteousness which is Christ we received for our salvation 1 Cor 1:30 , a righteousness that is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The righteousnesses of the overcoming believers in Revelation 19:8 are subjective so that they may meet the requirements of the overcoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the fine linen indicates our overcoming life, our overcoming living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is actually the Christ whom we live out of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I. To Be the Armies in Heaven Fighting with the Coming Christ against Antichrist and His Armies</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The overcomers will also be the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against Antichrist and his armies Rev 17:12-14; 19:11-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ's armies are composed of His called, chosen, and faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful" Rev 17:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see that those with Christ are called, chosen, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is significant that "chosen" is mentioned after "called."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many are called today, but few will be chosen in the future Matt 22:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Revelation 17:14 the chosen ones are those faithful to the Lord who will become His armies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 19:14 tells us that those in the Lord's armies are "dressed in fine linen, white and pure."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This fine linen is the garment of the overcoming believers that qualifies them both to attend the marriage feast of Christ and to fight with Him against His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the wedding garment becomes the fighting garment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The "fine linen, white and pure" qualifies the overcomers not only to attend the wedding feast but also to be in the armies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The overcomers who follow Christ to fight against His enemy will be properly formed heavenly armies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 19:19 says, "I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ's enemies are the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Antichrist undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet , and the kings of the earth and their armies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist Rev 17:12-14 , and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun Rev 9:16; 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ and His armies will defeat Antichrist and his armies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ as the King of kings and the Lord of lords with His armies, composed of the overcoming believers, will defeat Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies.</S>
