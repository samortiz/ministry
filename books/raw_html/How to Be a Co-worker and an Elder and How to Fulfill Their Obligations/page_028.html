<P>Prayer: O Lord, we praise You that Your abundant mercy is our daily song; we can never exhaust speaking it. Even tonight the fact that we are sitting here is also due to Your abundant mercy. Without Your mercy, we are the most pitiful people. O Lord, have mercy on us, even on every one of us. For more than seventy years You have been caring for and showing mercy to Your recovery, and You have been speaking to us to this day. O Lord, with Your word, give us Your Spirit without measure and pour Him out richly upon us that we may be full of Your word and Your Spirit, that is, full of Your revelation and light. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE DIVINE REVELATION IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>In the preceding three chapters we saw the full ministry of the Lord. His ministry is neither meager nor fragmentary but full. This Christ, who is unique in human history, did many things on the earth, yet it seems that not many people really know Him. Christianity gives people a very shallow impression by saying merely that Christ is God and the Creator of all things and that one day He became flesh to be the Savior of mankind. Today anyone who has received some education and has studied some world history surely has learned something about Jesus Christ. Some say that only He is the true God, that He created all things, and that He became a man as the Savior to mankind. These things are true, but they are not deep.</P><P>Among us, Brother Nee took the lead in loving the Bible and pursuing the truth. I can strongly testify that I followed Brother Nee simply because of these characteristics in him. From the time I was saved, I began to love the Word and seek the truth, so I regularly read spiritual publications. Among the publications which I read, there was one periodical that contained Brother Nee's writings in nearly every issue. When I read his writings, I felt they were quite unique. At that time, it can be said that the Christian writings in all of China were published in that periodical. However, although many had contributed, only a few were unique. Hence, I began to fellowship with Brother Nee by correspondence.</P><P>By His sovereign authority, one day the Lord brought me to Brother Nee. The moment I saw him, I was attracted by the way he talked, which was extraordinary. He was only two years older than I. The first time we met was when he came to my hometown. Consider this: his hometown was in Foochow (in the south of China) and mine was in Chefoo, Shantung (in the north of China). Thus, if it were not the Lord's sovereign arrangement, how could we have come together? Afterward, he asked me to work with him, so we worked together for the Lord for a total of eighteen years. More and more I sensed that he was truly a great Bible revolutionary; his interpretation of the Bible was different from others'. Perhaps you will ask if he understood other people's interpretations. Yes, he understood. He had read through the things taught by the church fathers, the things taught by the Lord's seekers after the time of the church fathers and prior to the Nicene Council in A.D. 325, and the things taught by Martin Luther, the mystics, the inner-life people, and the Brethren. He told me all of this history in order to perfect me. He was indeed a good shepherd to me. Because I had received such shepherding, shaping, and perfecting from him, a kind of mutual understanding was developed between him and me. In 1950 we were in Hong Kong together. He came out from mainland China and asked me to go to Hong Kong from Taiwan. We stayed together for one and a half months, from the middle of February to the beginning of April. After that, we separated from each other in Hong Kong with a mutual understanding.</P>
