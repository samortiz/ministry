   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JOSEPH CONFIRMED AND STRENGTHENED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE FULFILLMENT OF THE DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF HIS COMPANIONS IN PRISON</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was just a matter of days before the dreams of the cupbearer and the baker were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the dreams of Joseph's companions were fulfilled, Joseph was confirmed and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I had been Joseph, I would certainly have been encouraged, and I would have said, "Even though I have not yet seen the fulfillment of my dreams, I have the confirmation that the fulfillment will certainly come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I interpreted the dreams of these two men, and the interpretations have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will also happen in the case of my dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My fulfillment will also come."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>JOSEPH TRIED FURTHER BY HIS DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>NOT BEING FULFILLED</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fulfillment of the dreams of Joseph's companions came in a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But Joseph was tried further by the fact that his dreams were not fulfilled for another period of time 40:14, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 41:1 indicates that another two full years went by.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During these last two years, the test was most difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the cupbearer left the prison, Joseph pleaded with him to remember him, saying, "But remember me with thee when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house" 40:14, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Joseph seemed to be saying to the cupbearer, "When you are restored, remember me with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Don't just remember yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you are doing well and everything is going well with you, please remember me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, the chief cupbearer forgot Joseph 40:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joseph's dreams were confirmed, but they were still not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before the confirmation of Joseph's dreams, Joseph had faith; and after the confirmation was given, he had more faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more faith we have, the more testing we shall suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose you were Joseph there in confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What would you have said?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph might have said, "I had two dreams many years ago, and they have not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But these two men had a dream, and their dream was fulfilled after three days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How long will it be before my dreams are fulfilled?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the last two years were the most difficult period of Joseph's time of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we are describing in this message is not a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we follow the heavenly vision, we shall trace Joseph's footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never think that Joseph was enthroned immediately after he saw the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No, he had to pass through a long period of trial and testing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The visions Joseph saw not only controlled his life; they also sustained his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean, however, that if your faith is stronger, the length of time until the fulfillment of your dreams will be shortened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, the stronger your faith is, the longer the period of testing will be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Joseph's time of testing was much longer than that of his companions because he was more valuable than they.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because they were not so valuable, the time of their fulfillment came very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, for those two latecomers, there was nearly no testing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They each had a dream, and a few days later their dreams were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Joseph was important and valuable, the time of his testing could not be shortened.</S>
