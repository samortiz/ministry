   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Born of Water unto Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must first understand that the words of the Lord Jesus were spoken to Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord spoke to Nicodemus in plain words, not in symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Nicodemus heard the Lord s words, he understood what they meant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not bother to ask the Lord Jesus about the meaning of the word water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows that the Lord spoke to Nicodemus in plain words, not in symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Water refers to water, and the Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nicodemus understood this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What do water and the Spirit denote?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 1:33, John the Baptist said, I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse speaks of baptizing in water and also of baptizing in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew 3:7 says, When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them...</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this portion John the Baptist was speaking to the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 11 he said, I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John the Baptist told the Pharisees that he baptized them in water unto repentance but that He who was coming after him would baptize them in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John the Baptist s words concerning water and the Holy Spirit were spoken to the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, these terms were familiar to the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John the Baptist said that he baptized people in water unto repentance but that another One was coming who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Pharisees heard these words and understood them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, not too long afterward, one of the Pharisees called Nicodemus went to see the Lord Jesus and confessed that the Lord Jesus had come from God as a teacher John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus immediately responded, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God v. 3 . The Lord was telling Nicodemus that he needed to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to enter into his mother s womb and be born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus told him that this was not the case; rather, He was referring to the baptism of water and the Spirit spoken of by John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Nicodemus heard this word, he immediately understood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John the Baptist had said that he baptized people in water unto repentance, but that there was another One who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what it means to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Water refers to the baptism of John the Baptist, and the Spirit refers to the baptism of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament age God first sent John the Baptist to preach the baptism of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who received John s preaching would be completely immersed into water; he would be buried in water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When John came preaching the word of repentance, he was saying that all had sinned against God and were corrupt, even incorrigibly corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, they were good for nothing but burial.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John told the people who came to listen to his preaching that they were sinful, utterly wicked, and that they were worthy only of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were worthy of being terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John the Baptist baptized, buried, people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The baptism of repentance was the center of John s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John told people that his baptizing them in water could only put them into death, bury them, and terminate them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the Lord Jesus had not come, these people would merely have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They would not have been born of water; instead, they would have merely gone into water to die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, not only did John come, but the Lord Jesus also came, and He was greater than John.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John could not cause people to have life; he was sent by the Lord merely to put people into death, to bury them and terminate them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John could not give life to people or enliven them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the Lord Jesus came to baptize people in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To baptize people in the Holy Spirit means that the Triune God wants to enter into people and enliven them so that they may have life and the regenerating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to be born of water and the Spirit a person needs to confess before God that he opposes and rebels against God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He should turn to God and acknowledge that his inner being is so corrupt and his heart is so wicked that the only remedy is for him to die, to be buried, and to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person needs to acknowledge this fact and say, O God, not only is my conduct corrupt, for which I need Your forgiveness and the washing of Your precious blood, but also my nature is so corrupt that I am worthy only of being put to death and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The day that I was saved, I did not hear about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I only heard about the world s usurpation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was saved, and I did not want the world anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later, when I prayed, the Holy Spirit enlightened me, causing me to see my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I remember the experience very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On that day I confessed my sins for at least one or two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seemed that I could not finish confessing them; after I confessed one sin, I became aware of two more, and after I confessed those two, I became aware of more sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more I confessed, the more sins I became aware of, until I realized that I am utterly corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I will never forget that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I told myself that there was no one in this world who was as rotten as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I wished the ground would open up and swallow me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This kind of repenting and confessing is John s water baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is being born of water.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why should we be baptized as soon as we believe in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is baptism a ritual for joining a religion?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes when I ask a person whether he has believed in the Lord, he says that he has believed but that he has not yet been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Baptism is not a ritual for joining a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Baptism is to bury us because we are wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God in His ordination has already terminated fallen and corrupt man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross, we were crucified there with Him Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are identified with Christ by faith; hence, His death was our death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have died in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since we have died, we should be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what baptism accomplishes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord terminated us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We died in Christ and were buried together with Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, on the negative side, we first confess our sins when we believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We confess that we are corrupt to the core and that we are worthy only of death and burial, that is, that we are worthy of being put to death and terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to see that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be terminated because we have Satan s poison, Satan s element, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the Lord was on the cross, He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He bore every sinner when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, we were crucified together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Through the cross of Christ God terminated us, crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we believed into the Lord and acknowledged this fact, we were buried and terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is to be born of water.</S>
