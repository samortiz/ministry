   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the garden of Eden, man was given fruit for food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the flood man was given meat for food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was God's government as well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Confounding the Language</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the beginning there was only one language for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after man built the tower of Babel to demonstrate the united power of man, God confounded human language at Babel so that men would no longer speak the same language.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, when God poured out His Spirit at the time of Pentecost, the believers who were present began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This also was related to God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Scattered as Many Peoples</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time of the tower of Babel, the people on earth were divided into many "peoples."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These "peoples" signify races, not nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This also was a matter of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, God chose from so many peoples a unique people the nation of Israel, who would belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the separation of mankind into peoples was a matter of government.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Beginning of Nations</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a time these many peoples became many nations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The history of the Bible tells us that the beginning of the nations came after the beginning of peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First there were the races and then the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every nation had its own king.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This also was something established by God's government and under God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Israel Becoming a Nation</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time of the judges, the Israelites were still a race; they had not yet become a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the time of Samuel, they were still a race among other races, because there was no king over them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day the people of Israel wanted a king like the other races; they asked to be transferred from the sphere of grace to the sphere of government.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They wanted a king like other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God warned them by showing them how a king would reign over them 1 Sam 8:9-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Saul Becoming King</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, God chose Saul to be their king.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as Saul was chosen, God's system of government was introduced among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean that God's grace ceased; rather, it means that the Israelites explicitly placed themselves under His government.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They could no longer rebel against their anointed at will, because the anointed one had become their king.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even after Saul departed from God in the realm of grace, he remained a king in the realm of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must identify the two different systems here before we can understand the two different situations Saul was under.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In terms of grace Saul had fallen, but in terms of God's government he was still a king.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why David could not rebel against God's ordained authority.</S>
