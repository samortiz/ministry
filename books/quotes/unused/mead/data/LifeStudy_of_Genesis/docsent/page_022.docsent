   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6 The Separation of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from the Waters 1:9-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the second day, we have the third day the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the third day, the day of resurrection, the dry land appeared under the expanse for generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the sixth requirement for generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the whole Bible, the sea represents death and the earth represents Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible tells us that, eventually, after God has worked through many generations, the sea will be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Satan's rebellion and God's judgment of the original creation, there was nearly nothing except waters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, God came in to restore by the brooding Spirit, the living Word, and the dividing light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the second day, the expanse divided the waters, and on the third day God gathered the waters together under the expanse that the dry land might appear for producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that God had been working on the waters, seeking to confine and limit them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Jeremiah 5:22 we are told that God drew a line to limit the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, God is still working to eliminate the sea because in it there are demons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sea represents something demonic, something devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, when God's work is completed, there will be no more sea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the new heavens and new earth there is only land, no sea Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sea representing a main part of Satan's kingdom has been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The dry land appeared in order to produce life, to generate life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the third day, Christ came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ came out of death in resurrection just to generate life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you may be saved, the darkness within has not been cleared up, the waters have not been divided and confined, and the things of death have not been limited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As you are going on with the Lord, the waters of death within you will gradually be confined, limited, and eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Within you, the dry land will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Peter 1:3 tells us that we have been regenerated by the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without the resurrected Christ, there is no possibility for any life to be generated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The land was separated from the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The land signifies life and the waters signify death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To divide the land from the waters means to separate life from death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we grow in the Lord, we learn how to discern light from darkness, separate heavenly things from earthly things, and divide life from death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In my speaking I may have nothing dark and nothing earthly; yet I speak without life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am devoid of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My speaking is genuine and proper, with nothing of darkness and nothing worldly, but nevertheless is full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So, I must pray, "Lord Jesus, drive away all the death waters within me that the dry land may appear to produce life."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In my speaking there should be nothing of darkness, nothing of this earth, and nothing of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within my speaking there must be the dry land that produces life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In your family life, there may be nothing of darkness, nothing worldly, but also nothing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When someone comes into your home, he cannot see anything dark or worldly; neither can he see anything living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All that he can see there is death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I hope that when I come to see you, I will see that everything is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ, the dry land, is appearing in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is manifested, producing life in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the dry land there is no darkness and no waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We just have the dry land filled with every kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So, I say once again that what is revealed to us in Genesis is completely a matter of life.</S>
