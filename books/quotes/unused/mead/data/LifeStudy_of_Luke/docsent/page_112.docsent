   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WARNING THE RICH The Rich Man and Lazarus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 19 begins with the word now.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This conveys the meaning of furthermore and indicates that the Lord had more to say to the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 16:19-31 He went on to tell them the story of the rich man and Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This story was directed at the rich Pharisees, as moneylovers who were incited by their riches to indulge their lust.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Luke 16:19 says, Now a certain man was rich, and clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry splendidly every day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This story is not a parable, because it mentions the names of Abraham, Lazarus, and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a story used by the Savior as an illustrative answer to the money-loving and self-justifying Pharisees vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through this story the Lord warns them by unveiling that their miserable future will be like that of the rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a future will result from their rejection of the Savior s gospel because of their love for money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this story the rich man habitually clothed himself in purple and linen and made merry splendidly, sumptuously, every day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But a poor man named Lazarus was cast at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man s table; and not only this, the dogs came and licked his sores vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we are told that the poor man died and was carried away by angels into Abraham s bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The rich man also died and was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom v. 23 . The words Abraham s bosom are a rabbinical phrase, equivalent to being with Abraham in Paradise M. R. Vincent . Hades, like Sheol in the Old Testament Gen 37:35; Psa 6:5 , is the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept Acts 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Two Sections of Hades</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham s bosom, or Paradise, is the pleasant section in Hades where Abraham and all the just are, awaiting the resurrection, and where the Lord Jesus went after His death and stayed until His resurrection Luke 23:43; Acts 2:24, 27, 31; Eph 4:9; Matt 12:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Paradise differs from the paradise in Revelation 2:7, which will be the New Jerusalem in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often when Christians hear the word Hades, they think only of a bad place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hades is not an eternal abode for people in the next life; Hades is a place where disembodied spirits are kept temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are two sections in Hades: the section of comfort, a pleasant section, for the saved, and the section of torment for the unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By God s mercy and through His redemption, there is in Hades a pleasant section for His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to 16:22-25, Abraham is in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt, Isaac, Jacob, and all the other Old Testament saints are also there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, the poor man Lazarus went there after he died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, the Lord told the thief on the cross who begged the Lord to remember him in His kingdom that he would be with Him in Paradise 23:42-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have pointed out, this Paradise is the pleasant section in Hades, a section of comfort for God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to God s way, whenever a person dies his spirit leaves his body and goes to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The body is usually buried.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A disembodied spirit is a sign of death and is therefore shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, a place has been prepared for disembodied human spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among these disembodied spirits, some are the spirits of the saved in Paradise, the pleasant place of Hades, and others are the spirits of the unsaved in the section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the story recorded in 16:19-31 we see these two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also see that there is a chasm between them: And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm has been firmly fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither may they cross over from there to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This great chasm is a gulf that divides Hades into the pleasant section and the section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These two sections are cut off from each other and have no bridge for thoroughfare.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet those in the two sections can see each other and even talk to each other vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the rich man could see Abraham and Lazarus, he could speak to Abraham, and Abraham could answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The dead will remain in Hades until the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the saved ones will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will take place before the millennium, before the thousand years of God s reign on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The unsaved ones will remain in the section of torment in Hades for another thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the end of the millennium the unsaved ones will be resurrected from Hades and, with a body, will stand before the white throne to be judged and condemned to eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then their entire being body, soul, and spirit will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this story of the rich man and Lazarus the Lord Jesus revealed to the rich Pharisees their destiny, their future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By telling them this story, He was saying, Rich man, don t indulge yourself in lust.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You need to realize that your destiny will be the section of torment in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Need to Hear the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to verses 27 and 28, the rich man said to Abraham, Then I ask you, Father, that you may send him to my father s house for I have five brothers so that he may solemnly charge them, lest they also come to this place of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To this Abraham replied, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them v. 29 . Moses and the prophets refer to the law of Moses and the books of the prophets, which are the word of God Matt 4:4 . Whether one hears the word of God or not determines one s salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The poor man was saved not because he was poor, but because he heard the word of God John 5:24; Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The rich man perished not because he was rich, but because he rejected the word of God Acts 13:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the conversation between Abraham and the rich man we see why the rich man went to the section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He went there because he did not listen to the word of God and believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not go there because he was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, Lazarus, the poor man, went to the section of comfort because he listened to the word of God conveyed in Moses and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did not go to that section simply because he was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Abraham told the rich man that his brothers had Moses and the prophets and should listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The rich man then said to Abraham, No, Father Abraham, but if someone from the dead would go to them, they will repent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If people do not hear what the word of God says, they will not be persuaded even by one who resurrects miraculously from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Savior s word here implies that if the Jews represented by the Pharisees do not hear the word of God in the Old Testament, even though He will rise from the dead, they will not be persuaded.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This very tragedy occurred after His resurrection Matt 28:11-15; Acts 13:30-40, 44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Luke 16:31 indicates that we should not have a mind of curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those with such a mind may pay attention to a person who claims to be resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not listen to things that arouse our curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead, with a sober mind we should listen to the written Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we pay attention to the Word of God with a sober mind, not with a curious mind, we shall understand God s mercy and grace, and we shall be clear concerning His salvation.</S>
