   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE ABRAHAM AND THE LAND OF CANAAN Scripture Reading: Acts 7:2; Gen 12:4 13:18; 14:11-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham's history can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 12 through 14 form the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The emphasis in this section is the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters fifteen through twenty-two form the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The emphasis in this section is his son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapters twenty-three to twenty-five form the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It covers the events which happened in Abraham's old age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us first come to the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 12:4-5 says, "So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Abraham heard God's second calling in Haran, he left Haran and came to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we have to realize that it is possible for a person to reach Canaan without knowing why he is there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that once we see the vision, everything will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is one thing to see the heavenly vision, but it is another thing to not disobey the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After Abraham arrived in Canaan, verse 7 says, "And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the second time God appeared to Abraham and the third time He spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God appeared and spoke once more so that Abraham would have a clear and fresh impression of the things God had committed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is easy for us to lose the vision of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if we are consciously trying to be a proper Christian, it is still possible for us to lose our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can lose our vision even while we are working diligently day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that only mundane things can blur our vision; even spiritual things can blur our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not live continuously in God's appearing, it will be easy for us to lose the vision of our calling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The calling that the church has received is the same as the calling that Abraham received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But many people have not seen the hope of this calling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Paul prayed, "That you may know what is the hope of His calling" Eph 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Hope" indicates the content of this calling, the things included in God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May God deliver us from selfish thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know that God calls us with a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our salvation is to fulfill this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have not seen the substance of Abraham's calling, we will not see the meaning of our own calling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have not seen the key to Abraham's calling, we will not see our own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not see this, we will be like those who build a house without a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How easy it is for us to forget what God wants to do!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times, when we have too much to do and the work becomes a little more hectic, we lose sight of our spiritual calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to come again and again to the Lord and beseech Him: "Appear to me again and again, and speak to me again and again!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to have a continuous seeing, an eternal seeing; we need to see God's goal and what God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham had reached Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After he arrived in Canaan, several things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, he built three altars in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, he was tested three times in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>ABRAHAM BUILDING AN ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After Abraham arrived in Canaan, the Bible tells us that the first place he went to was Sichem or Shechem .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Shechem he built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second place he went to was Bethel, and there he also built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later he left Bethel and went to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then he went from Egypt to the south, and from the south he went back to Bethel, staying in between Bethel and Hai or Ai , the place where he first built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later he went to another place, Hebron, and built another altar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these three places, Abraham built three altars.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All three places have an altar, and all three places are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible shows us that God used these three places Shechem, Bethel, and Hebron to represent Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In God's eyes, Canaan carries the characteristics of Shechem, Bethel, and Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The characteristics of these places are the characteristics of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we see these three places, we will see what Canaan is like.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us consider the characteristics of these three places.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Shechem Shoulder the Place of Strength</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh...And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him" Gen 12:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abraham arrived in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The meaning of the word Shechem in the original language is "shoulder."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the human body the shoulder is the place with the most strength.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The shoulder can lift what the hand cannot pick up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore Shechem can also mean "strength."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first characteristic of Canaan is strength.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that God's strength is in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Canaan is not just a place flowing with milk and honey; it is also a place of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible shows us that God's power is not only a miraculous power, but the power of life; it is a power which satisfies man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How powerful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the power of life!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord's life has a power that satisfies!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once a man possesses the Lord's life, he will never thirst again, because he will be inwardly satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who are inwardly satisfied and who have received life within are the most powerful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are Shechem, the shoulder, and are powerful to bear much burden.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thank and praise the Lord that one characteristic of Canaan is the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Shechem there was the oak of Moreh Gen 12:6, ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The name Moreh means "teacher" or "teaching" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It has something to do with knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The oak of Moreh was in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that knowledge comes from power and that knowledge is the result of power.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In other words, genuine spiritual knowledge comes from the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do not have the satisfying power of the life of Christ, we will not have genuine spiritual knowledge and will not be able to convey anything spiritual to others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If God is to have a vessel to recover His testimony on earth, such a vessel must be a particular vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>With such a vessel, the first need is not to be taught doctrines; the first need is to be satisfied and to acquire the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then there will be real knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is a tremendous difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One is a matter of doctrine, while the other is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One is the result of hearing something outward, and the other is seeing something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>One results in forgetting what one hears, and the other results in receiving something unforgettable.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If anyone says, "I no longer remember the cross, because no one has preached about the cross during the past few months," this proves that the cross he has is only in doctrine and memory; it is not in life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have to remember that all genuine knowledge is found in the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ's power is our power.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Because we have something within us, we can share the same thing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord gives us inward power and inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Moreh comes from power.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have to be careful not to give to others just the doctrines that we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must have the spiritual thing itself before we can give it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In spiritual matters the clever ones end up taking the circuitous way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They trust too much in their cleverness, and as a result they wander farther away from the spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>May the Lord deliver us from objective teachings.</S>
