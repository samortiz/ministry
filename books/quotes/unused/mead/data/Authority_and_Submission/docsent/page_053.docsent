   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a deputy authority makes a mistake, God will step forward to judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His judgment is His vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's vindication is one great principle in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is willing to commit His name to us; He has allowed us to use His name, just as a man commits his personal seal to another and allows the latter to use it in his name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This being the case, when we misrepresent God, He will have to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God needs to show man that the mistake is caused by us and not by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses and Aaron suffered serious judgment as a result of one mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the end Aaron died and Moses also died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The greater loss though was their disqualification from entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither one of them debated with God; they knew that God's vindication was more important than their entry into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were willing to allow God to vindicate Himself rather than enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Deuteronomy 32 Moses especially made the point that they, rather than God, had made the mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must maintain the absoluteness of the truth; we should not try to take any shortcuts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No faithful servant of God should take the cheap way out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's vindication is more important than our face, our likes, and our years of prayers and hopes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moses and Aaron were meek; they submitted to the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They could have reasoned with God, but they chose, rather, to not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not pray for themselves even to the end. They prayed many times for the children of Israel, but they did not pray for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such silence is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They knew how to let God vindicate Himself, and they willingly took the blame upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Moses wrote of this in his book, he pointed out that he was the one who made the mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We thank the Lord because here was a servant who knew how to judge himself and who allowed God to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not argue in the face of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not make proposals lightly and he did not want to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was humble and gracious, and he feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is indeed a model for us who are serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May the Lord give us the grace to be a teachable person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May He be gracious to the church in this end time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to pray, "Lord, may Your authority be manifested in the church, and may every brother and sister know what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May authority be manifested in the local church, and may deputy authority be manifested through man."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that the responsible ones in the church will not make any mistake concerning the matter of authority, and I hope that there will also be no mistake on the part of those who receive orders from the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that everyone will know where he stands so that the Lord will have a free way to go on.</S>
