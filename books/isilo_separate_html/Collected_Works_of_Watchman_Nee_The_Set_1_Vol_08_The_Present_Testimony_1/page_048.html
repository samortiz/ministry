(See "The Extent of the Believer's Salvation.") It is possible for every Christian to have a pure conscience and a clean heart, and it is possible for him to be anxious in nothing. It is possible for him to be pure in his mind and focused in his thoughts. It is possible for him to be fully obedient to God and to fully honor and love God. It is possible for him to overcome the particular constitution of his physical being and present his members as weapons of righteousness to God unto sanctification. Every Christian should be able to reach the stage where he can say that he is crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives, but Christ who is living in him. This is entirely possible and attainable. Today I will speak to you about another matter: the way to obtain the overcoming life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LIFE OF CHRIST ON EARTH</H2><P>We know that when Christ was living on earth, He submitted fully to God; He did not love the world at all and did not speak or act according to His own will at all. He never allowed Himself to be overcome by temptations, and He never once sinned. He was submissive to God unto death. This is the life of Christ.</P><P>How about us? Have we fully submitted ourselves to God? No. Have we fully rejected the self-will? No. Are we fully sinless? No. Are we fully free from the love of the world? We may not love the world outwardly, but in our heart, we still love it secretly. Who among us is never moved by temptations? Not one. How shocking this is! According to the Bible, a Christian should be one who is fully subject to God, one who is completely free from the love of the world, one who does not go along with his self-will at all, one who does not sin at all, and one who is never once agitated by temptations. Yet, brothers and sisters, you will say that this is impossible. I say that this is impossible also. Some of us have been Christians for at least one or two years. Most of us have been Christians for three, four, or even five years. During these few years, what have we achieved? Many times we repent, regret, and even weep. But where is victory?</P><P>We know the standard of being a Christian according to the Bible. We should not go along with ourselves at all; we have to be as righteous as God is, and we should seek after the kingdom single-heartedly. But what are we like? We often sin. Our hearts are defiled. We still lose our tempers. We still secretly love the world, and we are controlled by our lusts. We do not love to read the Bible or pray. Sometimes we even think that it is better not to be a Christian at all.</P><P>The Bible says that we should, but we say that we cannot. We should do what we should. But we cannot do what we cannot. Can we say that God's truth should be lowered a little? Can we say that it does not matter that much if we sin once? Or will we say that it is all right for some to love God, submit to Him, deny themselves, and be holy, but that such a standard is not for us, but only for a special class of people?</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we have to see that even though we ourselves cannot do it, there is One who can do it. This One is Christ. We ought to be perfect, but we are not. However, Christ has achieved this; He has attained this perfection. This tells us three things:</P><P>(1) The standard of living that God has ordained is something to which every Christian can attain.</P><P>(2) We cannot attain to it.</P><P>(3) Throughout history, only One has attained it-Christ.</P><P>Do we believe that we cannot do it? Yes. Do we believe that Christ can do it? Yes. We should do it, but we cannot. We all admit that Christ is perfect. What then shall we say? A standard of living that is according to God can only be lived out by God. Not only is this true in the case of God, who is higher than us; it is also true in the case of lives that are lower than ours. We must have the same life before we can have the same living. Take the example of a bird. One must have the bird's life before he can have the bird's living. Take again the example of a beast. One must be a beast before he can live the life of a beast. Only God can live the life of God. Christ is God; therefore, only Christ can live the life of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
