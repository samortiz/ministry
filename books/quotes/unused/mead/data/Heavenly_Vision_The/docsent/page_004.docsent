   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Serving in Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The opposite of serving with confidence is serving in faith or with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person who serves God without having the vision is a person who serves in a natural way with much confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are naturally strong in themselves do not need faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, a natural person cannot have faith; he has confidence instead of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when we have the vision, we serve God not with confidence but with faith and in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Serving Fervently</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The opposite of serving enthusiastically is serving fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One who serves God fervently is not enthusiastic in himself but is fervent, inwardly burning in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Serving by the Lord's Guidance</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we need to ask, What is the opposite of serving God with a purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of serving with a purpose, we should serve by the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we do something with a purpose, we are behaving like a politician.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Politicians always do things with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we act with a purpose, the more political we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not have the Lord's guidance to go to a particular place, yet we go to that place with a definite purpose, we are serving naturally and religiously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose you are going to the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are going there with a definite purpose, you are going there as a politician.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are asked why you are going to the Far East, you should be able to say, "My going to the Far East is of the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not going there to accomplish a certain purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, I am going to the Far East according to the Lord's guidance."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is hard to discern guidance from purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may say that when you have the guidance you have the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if this is the situation, you need to act not according to the purpose but according to the guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Acts the apostles, the sent ones, went out, but it is difficult for us to see what their purpose was in going out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They went out by the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They had no purpose, but they did have the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider the example of Philip in Acts 8:26-39.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit guided him to contact the Ethiopian eunuch v. 29 . Philip did not have a purpose; he simply had the Lord's guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before Philip contacted the eunuch, Philip had no idea concerning what would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His contacting the eunuch was not with a purpose; it was by the Lord's guidance.</S>
