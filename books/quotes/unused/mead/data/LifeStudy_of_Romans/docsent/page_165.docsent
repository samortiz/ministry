   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE MEANING OF REIGNING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s intention in His creation of man was that man would express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion or authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that God intends that man enjoy Him as life and reign in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Genesis 1, man is to reign over the earth and especially over the creeping things, over the serpent in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:28 says that God commissioned man to subdue the earth, to conquer it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To conquer something involves defeating an enemy and seizing his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By defeating the enemy and taking his possessions, we reign over him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, in the beginning, God intended man to be a king in His life over Satan, the creeping one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GRACE AND SIN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan once was God s unique enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At a certain point, this enemy injected himself as sin into man in an illegal and evil way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Satan injected his evil nature into man, Satan became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin is something originated by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is actually Satan himself injected into man and incarnated in man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is helpful to see the difference between sin and evil, both of which are mentioned in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 7:20 Paul says, But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our flesh something called sin is dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 21 Paul says, I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 20 Paul speaks of sin, but in verse 21, of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To understand the difference between sin and evil, we need to see that before the creation of man God had a unique enemy, Satan, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of creation, man was pure, clean, and innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Satan injected himself into man and became sin in man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, sin is Satan incarnated in man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 5:21 speaks of sin, grace, death, and life: That as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to this verse, sin reigns in death and grace reigns unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see a vivid contrast between the reigning of sin and the reigning of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is also a contrast here between death and life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as sin is Satan incarnated, so grace is God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is proved by John 1:14, which says that the Word, which is God, became flesh, full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, grace is God incarnated in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Grace is God coming into man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God remains outside of man, there is no grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although other divine attributes exist apart from God s coming into man, there is no grace apart from God s being incarnated in man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God and man come together in the way of mingling, there is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although it is difficult to find a verse in the Bible which speaks of grace apart from the relationship between God and man, there are many verses in the Bible that show that grace is a matter of God s relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same principle, when Satan is separate from man, there is no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But once Satan comes into us, there is sin in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, sin is Satan related to man subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How precious is this understanding of grace and sin!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SIN AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we have this understanding, we shall be able to see the difference between sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When sin lies dormant within us, it is merely sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But whenever we make up our mind to do good by keeping the law in order to please God, sin is aroused and becomes evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Evil is sin acting within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever the indwelling sin becomes active, sin becomes the evil that is present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sin is the indwelling one, but evil is the present, active one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sin is Satan dwelling in us, but evil is Satan acting in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, both sin and evil are Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dwelling in us, Satan is sin, and acting in us, Satan is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Satan, sin, and evil denote one thing in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>GOD S THREE ENEMIES</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 5:12 says, Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This verse reveals that sin has brought in death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Hebrews 2:14, the one who has the power of death is the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These two verses indicate that sin and death are related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Satan, sin, and death are God s three enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First Corinthians 15:26 speaks of death being the last enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Genesis 1 God had a unique enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after man s fall, sin and death became His enemies also.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was a young Christian, I considered death something in the future; I did not regard it as something present today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But as 1 John 3:14 makes clear, we can be in death today: He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This verse does not say that he who does not love his brother will die; it says that he who does not love his brother abides in death even now.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are not in life, then we are surely in death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Romans 8:6 also proves that we can be in death today: For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
