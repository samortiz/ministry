Today it is not just a matter of whether or not the denominations are right. What matters is that if we feel they are right, we must support them, but if we feel they are wrong, we have to tear them down. We should not shake hands over the fence. If we say it is right to have the fence, then we must build it higher. If we feel the fence is wrong, we must tear it down. We should not have &#8220;spiritual&#8221; fellowship. What they call &#8220;spiritual&#8221; fellowship means a fellowship that is not thorough enough. Even though the denominations are wrong, some are reluctant to forsake them; they still want to preserve them while at the same time stretching their hand out for a little fellowship with others. If we fall into this category, it is definitely not of God. I do not know if we see this clearly. We must see this thoroughly before we can go out to deal with the situations in each locality. It is not enough for those who formerly closed themselves from others to merely open the window, shake hands over the fence, and think that this is all they need to do. If this fence should exist, I will build it stronger and higher, but if this fence should not exist, I will tear it down. Keeping different denominations and yet having fellowship is self-deception.<p>Today in China, there are probably three kinds of unity. The first kind is the unity of the Roman Catholic Church. The second kind is the &#8220;spiritual unity,&#8221; which means that although the separating &#8220;cups&#8221; still exist outwardly, one tells himself that such &#8220;cups&#8221; do not exist in his heart. This seems strange to me! If the denominations are not important, why should people allow them to exist? If the denominations are not important, why do people react when the denominations are touched? It is quite puzzling. If the denominations are important, we should support them; if they are not, we should tear them down. If fellowship is necessary, let us fellowship and not have the so-called &#8220;spiritual&#8221; fellowship. This is a really good term, but its usage has been spoiled. It is not really a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; fellowship but only a &#8220;half-way&#8221; fellowship! If this matter is made clear, I think the problem of unity can be solved easily.<p>With this kind of &#8220;spiritual&#8221; unity there is a great problem: Those who advocate &#8220;spiritual&#8221; unity give their attention to God&#8217;s children while neglecting God&#8217;s command. In other words, they pay attention to the feeling of God&#8217;s children but forget the feeling of God Himself. A man who supports the denominations is one who knows God very little. But many people dare not support the denominations if they are asked. They feel that the denominations are sin. However, because they have a consideration for many of God&#8217;s children in the denominations, they are not faithful enough to thoroughly unveil the truth of God to them. They do not show them how the divisions among God&#8217;s children are against God&#8217;s will. They are afraid that this will create some kind of partition between them and many of God&#8217;s children who are in the denominations. If they are asked whether or not they advocate and support the denominations, they would be somewhat bothered because they have studied the Word and received some light. Denominations are condemned before God and rejected by God. Nevertheless, they want to have a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; unity. This kind of &#8220;spiritual&#8221; unity or this attitude of shaking hands over the fence is nothing but a method to accommodate, a method to reconcile, and a method of compromise. They dare not utterly uphold the denominations, but they are reluctant to utterly forsake the denominations. Consequently, they allow the denominations to exist and advocate a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; unity, a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; fellowship. The real significance of what they call &#8220;spiritual&#8221; unity is a reluctance to be absolute toward God or to follow His Word. They dare not be absolute toward God for fear of men. The fear of being absolute toward God is today&#8216;s difficulty. In fact, many advocate &#8220;spiritual&#8221; fellowship and &#8220;spiritual&#8221; oneness because they cannot come up to the Lord&#8217;s demand; they are not absolute toward the Lord. This method is not from the teaching of the Scriptures, but from man&#8217;s wisdom and fear.<p>I believe that when we do not stand on the side of God&#8217;s children to excuse their weaknesses and their failures, but stand on the Lord&#8217;s side to look at His glory and His holiness, we will see that unity by accommodation is not of the Lord&#8217;s will and is not scriptural. We must be very clear about this. If we are clear about this, we can solve the problems.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
