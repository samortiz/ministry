   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Raised in Nazareth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point I need to present a little history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although you know the story, you may still need more light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mary conceived a child in Nazareth Luke 1:26-27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Under God s sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire Luke 2:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This forced all the people to return to their native places.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their home town.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt Matt 2:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Herod had died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Joseph had returned and had learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason Jesus was called Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does all this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes I have even used the word sneaky to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone called Him Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Bible said that Christ would be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The hidden way of Christ s birth bothered all the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Immediately Nathanael said, Can anything good come out of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is difficult to say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth, but in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nathanael was troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, Come and see John 1:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On another occasion, Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Pharisees asked him, Are you also from Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 7:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Galilee was a Gentile region, and the Bible says Galilee of the nations Matt 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Pharisees seemed to say to Nicodemus, Are you from Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We know that Jesus came out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But out of Galilee there comes no prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was His somewhat hidden and secret way of appearing to people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I refer you to the type of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tabernacle was covered with rough, tough badgers skin; outside, it did not appear to be very attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Inside, however, was fine linen, gold, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The spiritual principle of the church is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not look at the church from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need to come inside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am sure that if the Apostle Paul would come to visit you, you would be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You would ask, Are you Brother Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I thought that the Apostle Paul would be like a shining angel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are just a small man without a comely appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should never make a display of ourselves; neither should we ever know others according to the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must know them according to the inward spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In appearance, Jesus was a Nazarene, but within Him there was gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Within Him there was the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Second Corinthians 5:16 says that we should not know Christ or any man after the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, we must discern the inward reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must keep this principle today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to find Christ, we must have the shining star.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must not go according to the outward appearance, but according to what is within.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you would know the church or the saints, do not be bothered by the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not give any value to outward things, such as huge cathedrals, large church buildings, or pipe organs.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Forget all that.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Jesus had nothing outstanding outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was a little Nazarene, One who grew up in a province that was called Galilee of the nations and who was raised in a city despised by people Can anything good come out of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But if you come and see and get into Him, you will appreciate Him and be caught by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Likewise, you need to come into the church and stay with the church for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you do, you will find something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The same is true with the seeking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more they seek the Lord, the more they hide their experiences of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You need to go to them and stay with them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you will get into them and find the riches that are within them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You will see the frankincense, the myrrh, and many other precious treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then you will be attracted and caught.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the way to find Christ and to appreciate all He is and all His precious items, the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Matthew 2:23 says, He shall be called a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some have guessed this word Nazarene refers to Nazarite in Numbers 6:2.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Others have guessed that it refers to the Hebrew word for branch, netzer , in Isaiah 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But I do not think that we have to guess that much.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We know that in appearance Jesus was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This was spoken by the prophets.</S>
