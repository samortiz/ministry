   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can see from the above excerpts how crucial this revelation is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The contents of God s economy involve both the Triune God being processed and consummated and His chosen and redeemed people being processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Triune God was processed by becoming a man John 1:14 to pass through human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-surpassing resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then when this wonderful Spirit enters into God s chosen and redeemed people, they begin to pass through a wonderful process of becoming God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This process begins with regeneration and continues with sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification until they are consummated to be the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, at the end of the Bible there is a marvelous couple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God marries the bride as the consummation of the transformed, tripartite church Rev 22:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the ultimate consummation of God becoming a man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, so that God and man can be an eternal couple, a pair of lovers of the same kind, mingled together as one entity for eternity for the full expression of the Triune God in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not become God in His Godhead to become an object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only our wonderful Triune God embodied in Christ is worthy of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only He is the Head of the Body and the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the marvelous thing is that through regeneration we have received God s life and nature to become the children of God, the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In eternity past we were chosen to be holy by being predestinated unto sonship Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now through the process of being sanctified, we are being sonized, that is, we are being made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We aspire to walk according to the spirit to live Christ as we look forward to the day when He is manifested and we shall be fully like Him in life, nature, and appearance but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank the Lord for this high peak of the divine revelation!</S>
