<p>Christ is also a grain of wheat. John 12:24 reveals that Christ fell into the earth as a grain of wheat and died so that He might bring forth many grains. By His death as the Lamb, He took away our sin; as the brass serpent, He destroyed the devil; and as the grain of wheat, He produced many grains to form the loaf, which is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY</h2>
<p>Christ is the way (John 14:6). If you do not know how to contact God, take Christ as your way. Always and in everything take Christ as the way. The young brothers and sisters may not know how to go on as far as marriage is concerned. They simply do not know whom they should marry. At such a time, they should not try to know. Rather, they should take Christ and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are my way. I love You, I take You, I live by You, and I live for You.&rdquo; When they do this, Christ will be their way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 says that Christ is the power of God. In order to do anything, we must have power. Christ is the power of God for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 also says that Christ is the wisdom of God. In order to do things, we also need wisdom. Thus, Christ is the wisdom of God for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 indicates that Christ is our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Christ is power and wisdom so that He can be our righteousness for our past. Our past is miserable. In the past there were many sins and wrongdoings. Thus, for our past, we need Christ to be our righteousness. Hallelujah, by Him, through Him, and in Him, we have been justified, and our past has been forgiven.</p>
<p>For the present, Christ is our sanctification. Thus, we are now able to live a holy life. In ourselves, we cannot be holy and sanctified, but Christ is our sanctification. Day by day, for our present living, He is our sanctification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the future, Christ is our redemption. One day, our body will be redeemed. Therefore, for our past, Christ is our righteousness; for our present, He is our sanctification; and for our future, He is redemption. Oh, Christ is everything!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 2:10 says, &ldquo;The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.&rdquo; The deep things of God, or the depth of God, is Christ. All scientific knowledge is superficial. Only Christ is deep. If as a Christian you do not live by Christ, you are a superficial Christian. Although you may have a doctor&rsquo;s degree, you are still shallow, for whatever you know is superficial. But Christ is deep. If you have Him, you truly have the deeper life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:11 says, &ldquo;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the only foundation. For the church, God&rsquo;s temple, Christ is the foundation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PASSOVER</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 5:7 says, &ldquo;Even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.&rdquo; Because of Christ, God has passed over us, and we have no problems with Him. We have Christ as our Passover.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL FOOD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:3 speaks of &ldquo;the same spiritual food&rdquo; (Gk.). This indicates that Christ is our spiritual food, our heavenly manna. Daily we need to eat Him as our spiritual food.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL DRINK</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:4 indicates that Christ is our spiritual drink. As our spiritual drink, He is the living water.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
