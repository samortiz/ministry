We may find this difficult to understand. If someone sends you to a certain place, that person will usually remain where he is, and you will go to the designated place. But in the divine economy the Father sends the Son, and when the Son comes, the Father comes with the Son. On the one hand, the Father sent the Son; on the other hand, He came with the Son.<p>Bible students may have difficulty explaining how the Father could both send the Son and come with the Son. The reason for this difficulty is that some try to separate the Father from the Son. However, the Father and the Son cannot be separated. Actually, when the Father sent the Son, He sent Himself in the Son. The Gospel of John reveals definitely that the Son was sent by the Father and that the Father came with Him. Furthermore, according to John&#8217;s Gospel, where the Son is, there the Father is also, and when the Son speaks, the Father also speaks in Him. John 10:30 says clearly, &#8220;I and the Father are one.&#8221; The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son. When the Son speaks, therefore, the Father speaks His word.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that it is beyond our ability to analyze how the Father and the Son are one. We are not even able to analyze ourselves thoroughly. For instance, we know that the mind, the emotion, and the will are distinct. However, we cannot separate them. We cannot separate the mind from the emotion or the emotion from the will and then analyze these parts of our being separately. We know that a human being is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. But if we could separate these parts and analyze them, we would be killed. As soon as the three parts of a person are separated, the person dies. Although the spirit, soul, and body are distinct, they form a complete human being. Hence, where the body is, there the soul and the spirit are also.<p>We may use this picture as an illustration of the relationship between the Father and the Son. Where the Father is, there the Son is, and where the Son is, there the Father is. Furthermore, when the Son speaks, the Father speaks as well. Is this one speaking or two speakings? Perhaps we should say it is two-one speaking. Concerning the Father&#8217;s sending the Son and coming with the Son, we should not analyze, but instead simply believe whatever the Bible says.<h2 class=head2>Living and Working in the Son</h2><p>In John 14:10 and 11 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.&#8221; Here we see the Father living and working in the Son.<h2 class=head2>Giving All That He Has to the Son, Thus Embodied in the Son</h2><p>In John 16:15 the Lord says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; This indicates that the Father has given all that He has to the Son. Thus, the Father is embodied in the Son. Regarding this, Paul says in Colossians 2:9, &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; The Father has given all that He has and is to the Son. The Father&#8217;s being and doing are altogether in the Son. Hence, the Son becomes the Father&#8217;s embodiment.<h2 class=head2>Glorified in the Son</h2><p>According to John 13:31, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.&#8221; When the Son was glorified, the Father was glorified in Him. Later, we shall devote a full message to the matter of glorification.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_154.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_156.html">Next</a> </body></html>
