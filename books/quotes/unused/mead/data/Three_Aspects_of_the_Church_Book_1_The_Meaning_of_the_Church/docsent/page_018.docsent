   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Life Operating Within and Light Shining Without</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The picture in Revelation 22 clearly reveals that there is a throne out from which proceeds a river of water of life in the New Jerusalem v. 1 . The New Jerusalem presents a picture of the life of God operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The result of the operation of the river of water of life is the shining forth of light from within the city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord is life John 11:25 , and the Lord is also light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the Gospel of John, the entrance of God s life into us and its operation in us, brings in the light of life 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life in the middle of the street flows downward as a spiral, as indicated by the one river and one street that passes through all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the city the river of water of life is continually flowing as a spiral; this is a portrait of the operation of Christ s life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The outward expression of the city is the shining of light, and the inner content of the city is the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This may be likened to an electric lamp, which has the outward shining of light and the inward flow of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that by the inward flow of life there is an outward shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This light brings us into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If Christ as life is not able to shine forth from the church to be the light of the nations, all the things of creation will have no way to be headed up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the nations walk by the light of the city, there will be no harm to men and no damage to things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah Isa 11:9 , and all things will be headed up in Christ Eph 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible reveals that God does not enlighten all things directly from heaven; instead, God puts Himself into a vessel and shines forth through the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This vessel, a corporate vessel, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God imparts Himself into the church as His corporate vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the church allows God to move freely, it will be able to shine forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The shining will then become the light to all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, Satan, the source of death, brought the element of death into all things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When death enters, there is darkness, and darkness brings everything into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, God needs to do a work of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is the source of life; therefore, He recovers the oneness of the universe by entering into man to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, He became a man, a part of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He put His life into people, the church, and works in them so that they can shine Him forth as light to all things so that all things can walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the shining, all things will be in one accord and will be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the condition of oneness in the universe is altogether related to life and death, light and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Light of Life Making Us One</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many books and newspapers offer various kinds of opinions and theories concerning human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in the end we must confess that man is in darkness and that the human race is in confusion without oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, when we read human philosophy, we sense that the writers are speaking and groping about in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not know about man s source, current situation, or destiny, much less the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of them incline toward Socrates s understanding, and others lean toward Rousseau s understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Each has his own explanation, and as a result the situation on earth is truly confusing, causing people to be perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This confused situation can be cleared up only by God s life shining forth through the church and enabling people to see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this light all the different kinds of teachings, views, and human philosophies are done away with, and people are able to arrive at the oneness in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before we were saved, we had different views of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of us were professors, civil servants, soldiers, or businessmen, and in our different professions we all had different views of life; consequently, when we come together and are polite, we are able to get along with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In contrast, when we are not polite, we fight with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not respect and approve of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, it is wonderful that despite our different careers and backgrounds, whenever we walk in the light of Jehovah, we are one in our speaking and views.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our humanity, our views of life are as different as heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not agree with what other people think is right, and other people do not approve of what we consider to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we are not only in one accord; we are also one, having no differences.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The thing that makes us one is not doctrine, religion, or the teachings of the Bible; rather, it is the life of God that has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When this life shines forth from within us, it enlightens others and causes them to be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, apart from the life of God, there is nothing that can cause all things to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This principle can be applied to the unbelievers, to Christians, and to the Lord s workers, and even to all things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order for the co-workers to be in one accord, they must allow the life of God, that is, the Spirit of the living God, to operate in them rather than simply agreeing on the same doctrines, beliefs, and understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The degree to which we experience His operating determines the degree of the shining and the oneness we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are enlightened with the full knowledge of the Son of God Eph 4:13 , we can be brought into oneness under the shining of this light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Presently, all things are scattered and disintegrated because they are separated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Death has damaged the oneness of all things, causing all things to be separated from the Head, the Creator, who is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way of God s salvation is for Him, the center, the Head, and the source to enter into created man to be man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever God s life flows in man, His light is able to shine forth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the light shines on a person, he becomes joined to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Just as an electric current flows in an electric lamp in order for the light to shine forth, God as light is continually shining forth and bringing man under His authority so that man may have a union with God as the source, the Head, and the center.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way God heads up all things in Christ through the church.</S>
