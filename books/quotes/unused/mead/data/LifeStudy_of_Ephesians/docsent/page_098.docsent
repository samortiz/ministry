   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR TO BE FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:19 the Apostle Paul says, That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ makes His home in our hearts and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All this fullness dwells in Christ Col 1:19; 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through His indwelling, Christ continually imparts the very element of God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can be filled with God to such a measure and can attain such a standard, even unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way we fulfill God s intention that the church should be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when the riches of God. are expressed, they become His fullness John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we speak of the fullness of God, we imply that the riches of all that God is have become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE CHURCH METABOLICALLY CONSTITUTED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we get into the depths of 3:19, we see that the fullness of God is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter three of Ephesians is not concerned with the organization of the church nor with the formation of the church, but with the constitution of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is neither organized nor formed; it is metabolically constituted in us through our experience and enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for the church to be constituted in a practical way, we need to be strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then Christ must make His home in our hearts; He must occupy all the parts of our inner being and saturate them with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we need to be rooted and grounded in love, rooted for growth and grounded for building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following this, we must grasp the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to experience Christ in His universal dimensions both horizontally and vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Along with this, we come to know in our experience the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result of all these experiences, we are eventually filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, being filled unto the fullness of God is the outcome, the result, of all the deeper, higher, and richer experiences of Christ described in Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE HIGHEST DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The highest definition of the church is that the church is the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may be troubled at such a statement and may wonder how this claim can be substantiated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 21 Paul says, To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the context, the church in verse 21 is the very fullness of God in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When in our experience we are filled unto all the fullness of God, the church comes into being in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is at such a time that Paul says, To Him be the glory in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This glory is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in the fullness of God there is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the fullness of God is the church as God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some translations of verse 19 say, filled with all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to this rendering, the fullness of God would have to be the element, the essence, with which we are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this is a mistaken understanding of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE RICHES AND THE FULLNESS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I first began to speak on the difference between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ, some tried to argue with me by quoting John 1:16, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They said, John 1:16 declares that of His fullness we have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Isn t this fullness the riches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How then can you make a distinction between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ was on earth with His disciples, would you say that the riches of God were there with Him or that the fullness of God was there with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the riches had been with Him but the fullness had not, something would have been lacking; there would have been no completion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, suppose a glass jar contains just a few pieces of delicious candies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The jar contains some riches of the candies but not the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, after the jar is filled with the candies, it will have not only the riches but also the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the jar remains only partly filled, there will not be in the jar the expression of the candies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the fullness is the expression, without the fullness there can be no expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only when the candies fill the jar to the brim will there be the fullness as the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord Jesus came, He no doubt brought all the riches of God with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, with Him there were not only the riches of God, but there was also the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason John 1:16 says that we all have received of His fullness; it does not say that we have received of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you take a piece of candy from a jar filled with candies, you will be receiving candy, not from the riches of the jar, but from its fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fullness is the completion of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Greek the word for fullness means completion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, it is correct to render this Greek word as completeness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Greek word translated of in John 1:16 means out from or out of.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, out of the fullness of Christ, the completeness of all the riches of God, we have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before retiring at night, I often enjoy a glass of protein drink, preferably a glass filled to the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As I drink from such a full glass, I partake of the fullness of the protein drink in the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Christ came, He did not come only partially filled with the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the contrary, He was filled to the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the fullness, the completeness of what God is, was present with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This fullness, this completeness, is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus was like the glass, and the riches of God with which He was filled unto all the fullness of God were like the protein drink.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The disciples received not merely of the riches of God, but of His fullness.</S>
