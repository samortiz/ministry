   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By January 1, 1943 the revival in Chefoo was at its peak.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No announcements were made beforehand to have a meeting on that day, but the saints came and met.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From morning to evening, everyone met together without eating or drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was no schedule or program, but many things were carried out by the Lord that day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a couple of weeks, our meetings were similar to those recorded in Acts 2 and 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We met day after day for over one hundred days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was a one-hundred-day conference beginning on January 1, 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every meeting was different and new.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It would take many messages for me to relate all the wonderful things that happened during that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would like to relate a few things to give us some idea of what was taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During one afternoon, a young man, who was a student of about nineteen or twenty years of age, was reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He read Isaiah 1:3-4, which says, "The ox knows his owner, / And the donkey, his master's manger; / But Israel does not know, / My people do not much consider.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>/ Alas, sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ They have forsaken Jehovah; / They have despised the Holy One of Israel; / They have become estranged and have gone backward."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also read Jeremiah 8:7, which says, "Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was very inspired by these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord impressed him within that he should stand up that evening in the meeting to give a testimony concerning these two portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was very fearful of doing this since he was very timid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He told the Lord, "If you want me to give a testimony tonight, you have to do one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have to ask Brother Lee to stand up to read these two portions of the Word to all the people."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had never talked to him before, and I did not even know his name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He thought it would be impossible for me to do this, but he told the Lord that he would not give a testimony unless this happened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At a certain point in the meeting, we all knelt down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While we were praying, the Lord told me within to ask the saints to rise up and read Isaiah 1:3-4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was amazed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I said, "Turn to Jeremiah 8:7."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we read this verse, he gave a testimony, sharing with us about how the Lord had dealt with him concerning these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is one illustration of the prevailing move of the Spirit at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The move of the Spirit was also prevailing in all the homes of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The saints offered all of their possessions to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every evening all kinds of offerings were given to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just to keep an account of those offerings took much time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone came to the meeting with something to offer, so we had to have different groups to keep an account of the different kinds of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One group, for example, kept a record of all the title deeds to property that were offered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All those who owned any kind of property brought their title deeds and offered them to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By the last day of this revival, everyone literally offered all the things they had.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even things such as typewriters and sewing machines were offered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, seventy saints traveled by boat from Chefoo to inner Mongolia, migrating there for the spread of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They offered all that they had to the church, and the church assigned a certain amount of money and material things to each of them, which was enough for them to travel and live on for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our experience in those days was just like the beginning of the church life when "those who believed were together and had all things common; and they sold their possessions and properties and divided them among all according as anyone had need" Acts 2:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In my whole Christian life, I have never seen a revival like that.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In all the homes, there was not any loose talk or gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All that the saints spoke was Christ, the church, and the Lord's migration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every home old and young, fathers, mothers, and children was stirred up without one exception.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time we called ourselves "the host, the army, of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a situation was the result of our being in the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The saints entered into the service groups in the church life, and this caused them to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the revival came in. During that revival many young people were raised up who later became leading ones in the churches.</S>
