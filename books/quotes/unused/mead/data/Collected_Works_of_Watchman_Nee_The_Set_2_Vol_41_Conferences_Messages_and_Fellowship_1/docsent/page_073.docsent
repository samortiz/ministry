   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dealing with the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Thessalonians 5:14 mentions the consolation of those who are "weak," which in Greek literally means "little-souled."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who are little-souled are the ones who are psychologically weak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people have a strong soul, while others have a weak soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rest have an "average" soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as the human body varies in size from one person to another, man's soul also varies in size.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not easy for a man to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He tends to be either strong-souled or little-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who are strong-souled think that they have the strength to do many works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are full of self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are weak-souled have no self-respect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are afraid of everything and are withdrawn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both kinds of people are wrong and are of little use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God can only use those who have a will, feelings, and are sensitive, but who have no self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Shanghai there is a brother with a little soul and a big heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the prayer meetings, he prays long prayers and loves to say, "Holy, holy, holy," in his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of person will never change unless he experiences the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those with a strong soul tend to despise those with a weak soul because weak-souled ones appear to be unresponsive and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The strong-souled ones are the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should only deal with our own weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are little-souled lack power in their soul and cannot accomplish much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, those with a strong soul work by the power of their soul rather than by the power of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For these reasons, neither kind can work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not deal with this matter properly, we will not be able to experience the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are several famous evangelists in China who are strong-souled men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those with a strong soul need the cross to break down their strongholds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those with a weak soul need the outpouring of the Spirit to make up what they lack.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Little-souled ones need to read 1 Corinthians 12 to 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They should seek for the outpouring of the Spirit so that their lack can be filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to become a suitable vessel of the Lord, we have to deal with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A preacher can be tall or short in physical stature and speak just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if his soul is too big or too small, he will have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A worker must first deal with himself in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He must also consider the factors mentioned above when he assigns responsibilities to local brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We tend to appoint people with a strong soul because they exhibit their talent more readily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet such people must be dealt with by the cross before they can engage themselves in spiritual works.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those with a small soul must receive strengthening from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, they will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The best kind of people are those who are balanced, but such people are hard to find.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a great matter, and we have to handle it carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two co-workers in Chekiang.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most people agree that they are little-souled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Someone asked me once how I felt about them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I agreed that they were little-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Others would be stirred up, but they would still be cold.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others would come up with some ideas, but they would find it hard to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet both of them have an excellent spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once they came to me and said that they wanted to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I asked, "Who do you think are the ones who can have great achievements and accomplish great works in China?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They answered, "Those who are strong-souled."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I then asked them to read 1 Corinthians 12 through 14 and charged them to seek after the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Little-souled ones should not be discouraged; they should pray earnestly to the Lord for the filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, we should not entrust matters to the little-souled ones too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we should wait until they have received the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, we should realize that strong-souled ones must go through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You will know if you have a strong soul or a weak soul if you humble yourselves and ask others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You will know your lack.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not deal with this matter properly, God's work will suffer much loss.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is truly a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that the workers will have a thorough dealing with the Lord concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The cross deals with the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It deals with what a man already has.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit deals with the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It deals with what a man does not have.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Few people like the little-souled ones; everyone tends to love the strong-souled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet the latter soon tire people out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Little-souled ones are exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Others do not like them at the beginning, but they become likable after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many people boast about the strong-souled ones and feel sorry for the little-souled ones, but if a little-souled one is perfected, he may become more useful than a strong-souled one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>QUALIFICATIONS OF A CO-WORKER</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to be a co-worker of God, there are at least eight qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One must 1 be saved, 2 be victorious, 3 have power, 4 be called, 5 have gifts, 6 have a ministry, 7 have dealt with all the negative things mentioned above, and 8 know the Body life and not be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to work for the Lord, a man must be dealt with by the cross and be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>OTHER POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our testimony today is an extension and continuation of the apostles' testimony; it is not a new testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, strictly speaking, we should not call anyone our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the Body of Christ, the affair of one member is the affair of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is like eating, seeing, and hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the mouth eats, the whole body eats; when the eyes see, the whole body sees; and when the ears hear, the whole body hears.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>During this conference, we have only covered the experience of Galatians 2:20 and 2 Corinthians 12:9.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are many more riches in His Word than what we have covered.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For this reason, we should all have the proper ambition to keep on pursuing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should not have any ambition for the things and people of the world, but we should have a healthy ambition for God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Unless a person is dealt with by the Lord daily and seeks after the Lord personally, he cannot deal with others or help others.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Lord, forgive me for pointing out the attitudes, shortcomings, lack, and weaknesses of others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May I not be reproached that day at Your judgment seat by my reproach of others today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>May my judgment today not become a judgment on me on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Lord, cover me with Your precious blood.</S>
