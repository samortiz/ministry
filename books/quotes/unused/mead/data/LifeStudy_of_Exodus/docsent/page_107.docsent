   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE ISRAEL S EXPERIENCE AT ELIM Scripture Reading: Exo 15:27; Num 33:9; John 7:38-39; Psa 92:12a; Lev 23:40; Neh 8:15; John 12:13; Rev 7:9; Exo 24:4, 1; Num 11:16, 24-25; Luke 9:1; 10:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the pillar of cloud led them to Marah, and then to Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we study a map, we shall see that they did not journey in a way that was according to the human concept, but in a way that was according to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that when the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt, God did not lead them through the way of the land of the Philistines 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, He led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea 13:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God deliberately led them to the south so that they could be baptized in the Red Sea, the baptistry He had prepared for them in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having crossed the Red Sea, they did not journey northward to the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God led them southward to Marah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Remember that it was God Himself in the pillar that led the people on their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He led them to take a way altogether different from that which is according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we had been there, we probably would have said, Moses, where are we going?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are we on our way to the good land, or to Arabia?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To such questions, Moses might have replied, I do not choose the way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The pillar is guiding us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just three days ago, this pillar protected us from Pharaoh s armies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don t you think we should trust in this pillar and follow its leading?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No doubt, the children of Israel expected to be led northward, to the good land; however, God led them southward, to Marah and to Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this we see that God s way is different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I. THE EXPERIENCE OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Israel s experience at Elim is a picture of the experience of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all know that death ushers us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, our concept is that this experience of resurrection will be on a way that is upward, not on a way that leads downward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our opinion, any way that leads downward is not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, in itself resurrection takes us upward, but its application requires us to take a way that leads in a downward direction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are in the heavenlies, we do not sense the need for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when we are in a low situation, we become conscious of the need for resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we are in death, even in a tomb, we need resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, the experience of Elim is in a downward direction from Marah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we consider the spiritual significance of 15:27 according to our experience, we need to be reminded not to study the Word of God in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should study the Word according to the way of life, according to the way the Lord Jesus applied the Old Testament Scriptures in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This way is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although this account is very short, only one verse long, we need to take the time to study in a thorough way Israel s experience at Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we shall begin to see the riches implied in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have pointed out that instead of northward, the direct way to the land of Canaan, the children of Israel journeyed southward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No doubt, the good land was higher in elevation than the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the way into this elevated land was downward, down to the south.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that to reach a high destination we need to take a downward way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>ISSUING FROM</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE EXPERIENCE AT MARAH</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some readers of Exodus may think that the children of Israel journeyed southward because they did not have the faith to go directly into the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although their lack of faith was a factor later, it was not the reason for their southward journey here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If they had not gone to the Red Sea, they could not have passed through the baptistry God had prepared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They had to pass through water in order to be saved from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God s judgment, but the water of the Red Sea saved them from the armies of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were led to the Red Sea, not because they were weak in faith, but because they needed to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we have pointed out, even after they had crossed the Red Sea, they did not immediately journey northward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Contrary to our expectation, the pillar of cloud led them downward from Shur to Marah.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After their experience at Marah, the pillar continued to lead them downward to Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Israel s experience at Marah signifies the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we have an experience of the cross, we may expect to go upward.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we shall go downward once again, for the experience of resurrection is in a downward direction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you go upward instead of downward, you will not experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some Christians think that God leads His people only upward, never downward.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But according to the picture in Exodus, the pillar of cloud led the children of Israel downward from Marah to Elim.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I can testify that the journey from Marah to Elim corresponds to my spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After I have experienced the crucified life, I often expected to be in an upward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But just the opposite has taken place many times.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God led me downward, into a situation that was lower and even more difficult to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not be frightened by this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we follow the pillar of cloud in a downward direction, we shall arrive at Elim, where there are twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the experience of resurrection which issues from the experience of the cross, the experience at Marah.</S>
