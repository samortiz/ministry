Not only do we not have the reality of the building; we lack even the concept of the building up of the church
Most Christians have as their goal getting saved and going to heaven and are ignorant of the revelation of the building of the church
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being
We see that the body of the Lord Jesus is a temple not only due to His incarnation but also to His resurrection
We need to note that the word where repeatedly mentioned in John 14 is a matter not of a place but of a person
These verses show us that after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He regenerated us, enabling us to live just as He lives
One of them means to make home, as in Ephesians 3:17, which says, 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith'
When we who are saved are one in the Triune God, it is easy for the world to believe that the Lord Jesus is the Christ sent by God
The Lord says that He is able to make us one because He has given to us the glory which the Father has given Him
Many suppose that the Lord's giving us peace, food to eat, and clothes to wear, and His caring for all of our needs is His love for us
However, the emphasis is not on these matters and not even on the love shown by the Lord's dying and shedding His blood for us
The focus is on God the Father giving glory to all those who belong to His Son that they may be absolutely one in the Triune God
From the day of the Lord's resurrection, Peter saw the glory that God had given to the Lord because Peter was in the Father with the Lord
Verses 11 and 12 of chapter five say, 'And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son
Some are in favor of translating it as this, while others are in favor of translating it as He: 'He is the true God and eternal life'
It would be very simple to translate it as He, referring simply to God's Son Jesus Christ in the previous sentence
It then refers not only to the Lord but also includes all the things mentioned in the preceding passage as well
We all know that John did not write only these two categories of books; he also wrote a book of prophecy, which is Revelation
Now since this city is the tabernacle, and in this sense it is also the temple, it cannot have another temple within it
In the meetings in the mornings we will give additional words concerning the building of God by reading some portions of the Scriptures
It is first because the ultimate manifestation of God's building is revealed to us in the book of Revelation written by John
The manifestation of the New Jerusalem is the completion of God's building in the universe throughout the ages
In the books written by the other apostles, we rarely see statements telling us that God abides in man and man abides in God
If we would know God's building in the universe, we need to understand the matter of the mutual abiding of God and man
God shows us that after He created man, He placed him in the center of the garden of Eden, in front of the tree of life
At the end of Revelation, when the building of God is consummated, there will still be the tree of life in the New Jerusalem
After food is eaten and digested by man, it becomes his blood, his bone, and his flesh, completely mingled with him as one
In this city, God and the Lamb are the temple, and the redeemed ones throughout the ages are the foundations and the gates
When the Gospel of John talks about the Lord Jesus who comes to be man's life, it says that He is the bread of life and that He is the vine
In the entire Bible, no one speaks more clearly than John concerning God abiding in man and man abiding in God
God's building is completed by God coming into man to be man's life and by mingling Himself with man, which is precisely John's ministry
Due to the limited time, in these messages we cannot read John's writings chapter by chapter and verse by verse
Even though He came into time and was restricted by time, He imparted to man the eternal life, a life that is beyond time
In other words, Genesis starts at the beginning of time, while John starts before time began, in eternity past
It is after he speaks of the God who was in the beginning that he goes on to speak of all things coming into being through Him
Mark contains a record of the Lord Jesus' ascension, and so does Luke, but neither John nor Matthew contains such a record
Perhaps you will say that out of the four Gospels there are at least two that mention the Lord Jesus' ascension
Of the two books that do not mention His ascension, one speaks of Him as King while the other speaks of Him as God
The one that says He is King not only does not mention His ascension, but it says that He will be with us until the consummation of the age
Matthew also says that where there are two or three gathered into the name of the Lord, there He is in their midst
The Gospel of John says that the Lord is the One from the beginning, from eternity past, who came into our midst
We do not need to climb a ladder that goes up to heaven to abide in the Lord for a while and after a few days come down
After the Lords resurrection the disciples were inside the house with its doors and windows shut and the Lord suddenly came into their midst
He reappeared when Peter and the other disciples went fishing in the sea, and we do not know where He went afterward
Man had not yet entered into God, so beginning from chapter fourteen, this Gospel speaks about His bringing man into God
Without the arrival of 'that day,' the disciples could not know, because it was not possible to have such an experience
Chapters one through thirteen talk about the situation and the story of the Lord's incarnation, which brought God among men and into man
We need to have a deep understanding of the background of the Old Testament in order to understand the meaning of these words
In the beginning of the Old Testament, Genesis 2 says that after God made man He placed him before the tree of life
It was from the God who dwelt in the tabernacle that the Israelites drew the supply to meet all their needs in the wilderness
We need to have a substantial background in biblical knowledge to understand this point otherwise we will not have a thorough comprehension
If you impress this picture into your mind and then come again to read what the Lord Jesus said, you will clearly understand its meaning
The result of incarnation is that heaven is open to earth and earth is joined to heaven for God to be joined with man
Because of this, we should believe that the Holy Spirit had a specific intention in recording the Lord Jesus' cleansing the temple in John 2
In verse 18, after the Lord had cleansed the temple, the Jews asked Him, 'What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things'?
The Jews would kill Him to destroy His body, but through His resurrection the Lord would rebuild His body that was destroyed by the Jews
It is this tabernacle, this temple, that one day would cause the heaven to be opened and the angels of God to ascend and descend on Him
They may realize from reading the Gospel of John that in the Lord was life and that He came that men may have life
God's coming into us as food to be digested in us to be our life is likewise for the building up of His spiritual Body
Although this temple was destroyed, through His resurrection the Lord rebuilt the temple and enlarged it as well
If you observe all the happenings among men, you will realize that the most miserable thing is that man's life runs out
Man eats, drinks, and enjoys on the earth, attending a 'wedding feast,' but man is in death; his life will run out
Chapter three speaks about a moral man, a gentleman, one who feared God and endeavored to do good to please God
Man's problem before God is not a matter of doing good but a matter of being regenerated, receiving God into himself as life
It is not a matter of doing good or doing evil but a matter of whether or not one has received God as life to be regenerated
God comes into man to be man's life, causing one who is weak to become strong and one who cannot move to be able to move
Some brothers and sisters may have been religionists who celebrated religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter
You might have felt very joyful while celebrating a feast, but when it ended, you felt that religion could not quench your thirst
When God Himself mingles with you, a clay man, through the words that proceed out from His mouth, your eyes are opened
There is the need for the God who comes to be mans life to enter into man to mingle with man so that mans eyes may be opened and enlightened
The Lord who came to be man's life caused him to be raised from the dead, come out of the tomb, and be freed from all bondage
In this way they can become materials for His building to be built up by Him as His Body and the dwelling place of God
If a person is willing to wash your feet, that is an indication that there is nothing else he would not do for you
Since the man whom God desires for His building is in such a condition, He needs to solve these problems and meet these needs for man
If a man lives by Him, He causes rivers of living water to flow out of his innermost being to water and satisfy others
He can do all of these things by imparting His life to man, and He cares for man to the uttermost, bearing all of man's responsibility
In brief, therefore, the first half of the Gospel of John tells us that God came among men to be built together with men
The center of the first half, composed of chapters one through thirteen, is God's becoming flesh and coming into man
At the beginning of chapter fourteen, therefore, the Lord said, 'Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me
As early as chapter two, when the Lord cleansed the temple, He said, 'Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise'
It is strange that when people come to the Father's house mentioned by the Lord in John 14, they think it refers to heaven
In the Bible, whether the Old Testament or the New Testament, God's house and the Father's house are mentioned numerous times
He said, 'The Lord told us that He would go and prepare a place for us, and when it is prepared, He would come again
Oh, it has taken the almighty Lord more than one thousand nine hundred years, and yet the heavenly mansion has not been fully prepared!
Could it be that today the Lord is building the church on the earth and at the same time building a mansion in heaven as the house of God?
In other words, are the building of the church in Matthew 16 and the preparation of a place in John 14 two matters or one?
Please consider, in John 14 when the Lord again mentioned the Father's house, can this Father's house be heaven?
Because of this, the Lord said that He would go to do something, which was to open a way, to prepare a place, to bring them into the Father
In saying that He would come again after preparing a place, the Lord was not at all referring to His second coming in the future
Brothers and sisters, this is altogether different from the concepts we have received in the past from traditional Christianity
When the Lord became flesh, He provided God with a tabernacle to dwell among men, yet this tabernacle was limited to only one individual
Simply speaking, the Lord was showing us that He would go through death and resurrection to accomplish the building of God
The Lord's going does not refer to His leaving the earth to ascend to the heavens, but it refers to His going to die
To be sure, the Lord's going to prepare a place for us is not for us to go to heaven but for us to enter into God
In His incarnation He came out of the Father; now He was going into death and resurrection to go back into the Father
Among the disciples there was Thomas a doubtful person who asked the Lord Lord we do not know where You are going how can we know the way
The strange thing is that today many people seem to be smarter than Thomas and are sure that the Lord was going to heaven
If the temperature lowers to the freezing point the water freezes into ice which is the transfiguration of water since it is in another form
On the one hand, there are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; on the other hand, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one
Please keep in mind that even though the Lord Jesus was God becoming flesh, He could be only among men; He could not get into man
Here the Lord was obviously referring to His appearing to the disciples and His coming into their midst after His resurrection
The Lords intention in appearing to them after His resurrection was to teach them to turn from knowing Him outwardly to knowing Him inwardly
We can say boldly that in chapter fourteen there is not the matter of space or the matter of place but only the matter of person
With these three ins, with the mingling and mutual indwelling of God and man, the Lord accomplished the building of the temple
Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?
He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
The Fathers house refers to the building of God in the universe and the many abodes are people who are mingled with God and who abide in God
John 1613b15 says For He will not speak from Himself but what He hears He will speak and He will declare to you the things that are coming
The Lord said, 'I am going to the Father'; this still refers to that mysterious event, and that was why the disciples did not understand it
During that time the Lord's followers would weep and be sorrowful, but the world that crucified the Lord would rejoice
The Lord's seeing the disciples again is not at the time of His second coming but in the day of His resurrection
In the evening of the day of the Lords resurrection the Lord did come into the midst of the disciples and the disciples saw Him and rejoiced
Going in these three chapters also refers not to the Lord's leaving the earth to ascend to heaven but to His death
All who read the Greek New Testament know that world in verse 28 is the same as world, that is, the people of the world, in 3:16
Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God'
We need to keep in mind that the first section of John is about God coming into man, and the second is about man entering into God
John 14, 15, and 16 speak about the Lord's coming by going, and this coming by going is His death and resurrection
In His incarnation He came forth from the Father into man; in His death and resurrection He went forth from man into the Father
In other words, through incarnation He brought God into man, and through death and resurrection He brought man into God
Through incarnation He brought God into a union with man, while through death and resurrection He brought man into the mingling with God
From chapter one to chapter thirteen He could only say, 'I am in your midst' and could not say, 'You are in Me and in the Father'
Rather, He went through death to solve the problems between God and man, to open a way that man may have access to God and abide in God
He has been doing this building work in us with His resurrection life that we may enter more into God and deeper into God
He would resurrect from death to impart His life to us that we may live as He lives, causing us to be able to abide in Him and He in us
The concluding prayer we offer when we have finished speaking a message is often the central thought of the message
All the Bible expositors and those who pursue spiritual experience admit that glory is very difficult to explain
In the tabernacle in the Old Testament, God's glory, or we may say God Himself, was concealed within a veil in the Holy of Holies
Although the incarnated Lord was inwardly God Himself and absolutely glorious, He appeared before men outwardly as a lowly man
While He was in the flesh, in His dealings with men, His glory was not perceived, because it was hidden within Him
Philippians 2 tells us that He humbled Himself, lowered Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men
Recall the time when the Lord Jesus went up the mountain with three disciples and was transfigured before their eyes
When He was on the earth, He was the Son of God and had God within Him, but people always saw Him as a lowly man
Brothers and sisters, for God to become flesh and enter into man was to be made lowly; for man to enter into God was to be glorified
He asked God to cause all that was hidden within Him-God's life, God's nature, and all that God is-to be manifested and expressed
In this way You will glorify Your Son, and Your Son will also glorify You because all of Your fullness will be expressed through Your Son'
John 17:2 says, 'Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him'
Verse 3 continues, 'And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
We can explain it this way: The Lord Jesus did many things on earth, and everything was done according to God's will
The Lord not only gave them the eternal life, but He also manifested the Father's name to them that they might know who the Father was
By now the disciples understood that the Lord came forth from God, but they still did not understand that the Lord was going back into God
If you can tell the Lord, 'All that is mine is Yours,' then you can also tell Him, 'All that is Yours is mine'
Because the husband and wife have become one, all that the wife has belongs to the husband, and all that the husband has belongs to the wife
Through these four items-the eternal life, God's name, God's word, and God's glory-all those who belong to the Lord were brought into God
These four items not only bring all of us who belong to the Lord into absolute oneness, but they also bring us fully into the Triune God
The eternal life entering into you, into me, and into everyone who belongs to the Lord brings us all into fellowship
The more someone understands God's word and has God's speaking, the clearer the separating line is between him and the world
The more you blend with the world, the more difficult it becomes to be in harmony with the brothers and sisters
The more you are separated from the world, the more you are drawn towards God's children, and the more you are in harmony with them
If we have the stains of the things of the world on us or the things of the self, then we will not be able to mingle with God's children
You can go and observe; wherever the brothers are not in one accord, in harmony, there is no power of the gospel
The gospel continues to be preached, but not many are saved, and those who are saved are not very strong and prevailing
What the Lord meant was that He was now in the Father and He also would like His disciples to be with Him in the Father
Now it is clear that this where does not at all refer to heaven, a place, but refers to being in God, that is, to being in the Father
In these four chapters can you recognize such a concept that the Lord's intention is to save us who are on the earth and bring us to heaven?
If He had not gone through death and resurrection, man could not be in God, for man had not yet entered into God
Before John 14 you cannot find any verses in which the Lord told the disciples, 'You are in Me' or 'I am in you'
They would receive the eternal life of God, know who God is, receive God's word, and thereby be separated from the world
His death, on the one hand, was the shedding of blood for redemption, thus solving the problems we have before God
On the other hand, it was the releasing of the life of God that we may enter into God and have a union with God
Verses 22 and 23 of chapter twenty continue, 'And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit
Brothers and sisters, from then on the Lord was not only in the midst of the disciples but also in the disciples
According to our concept, there should be an additional sentence in verse 23, saying, 'After Jesus spoke this word He went away'
Now as soon as the morning broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus'
From God's perspective, however, He has already resurrected and completed this temple, because with Him there is no element of time
The last passage in the Scripture reading above, Hebrews 12:22-24, was poorly translated in the Chinese version of the Bible
The writer of the Epistle was saying, 'Although you are on the earth now, you have come forward to Mount Zion in the heavens'
He was referring not to the Hebrew saints who were dead but to the saints who were alive and were reading this Epistle
The mountain was set on fire, and there were darkness, gloom, a whirlwind, the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words
Today, however, in the New Testament age, we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but under the grace of the new covenant
It is because although they lived in the Old Testament age they still belonged to Gods eternal covenant the covenant God made with Abraham
Under this covenant, there is only Mount Sinai with thunder, lightning, fire, the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of the words of God
There are saved ones only under the covenant of Abraham and the new covenant; there are no saved ones under the covenant of law
From God's point of view, the Lord's incarnation was His coming to the earth to set up a tabernacle for Him to have a dwelling place
If you cannot find the answers after you have read his Gospel and his Epistles, you can still read his Revelation
Revelation 19 says that the bride is clothed in fine linen, bright and clean, which is the righteousnesses of the saints
On the one hand, since the bride is a city, she is a corporate person composed of all the saved ones, the saints
It is not merely a turn but a circular three-hundred-sixty-degree turn, from pitching a tabernacle to pitching a tabernacle
They were strangers on the earth, so they longed after a heavenly country, which is the city whose Architect and Builder is God
They simply felt that the earth was not their dwelling place but merely a place where they wandered and sojourned
She is a group of people redeemed by the Lord, a group of people who are mingled with God as one to become God's tabernacle
It is the very God who tabernacled among men by putting on humanity, entering into humanity, and being mingled with humanity
The bride includes all those who were saved in the Old Testament and all those who are saved in the New Testament
Does it mean that God is building the church on earth, on the one hand, and building the holy city in the heavens, on the other?
They say that Matthew 16 is on the building of the church and Ephesians 2 and 4 are also on the building of the church
God's building of the holy city is His building of the church, and God's building of the church is His building of the holy city
When the holy city is manifested, there is no temple in it, for the city is the very temple; it is the enlargement of the temple
From Genesis 2, after God completed His creation, He placed Himself before man to be man's bread of life for man to take in
The Lord's incarnation was for the building of the temple, and the Lord's death and resurrection were also for the building of the temple
It is written in the Bible that from the time of the Lord's resurrection, He has been doing this building work as the Spirit
All of their work, be it preaching the gospel or edifying the saints, takes the building of this spiritual house as the goal
All of their work took the building of God's spiritual house as the purpose and the building of God's dwelling place as the goal
He said that the Corinthians were God's building and that they, the apostles, were God's fellow workers who were building up the Corinthians
The work God did in the Old Testament was to build His people, the Israelites, that they might become the house of God
When both are completed, the work that God has been doing throughout the ages will be aggregated to become a city
Brothers and sisters, we need to see that the work that God has been doing among His people throughout the generations is this building work
The edification we receive after we are saved is not for us to become items for exhibition but to become materials for building
Now due to the work of grace in you, you have been dealt with, broken, perfected, and made fit for God's building
For six thousand years this building work is what God has been doing, and it is also what Satan has been undermining
We can almost say that Satan would allow people to do any kind of work, but he would never allow people to build the church
Whenever you bring up the matter of the building of the church, you encounter Satan's opposition, attack, and damage
We will begin by studying some Scriptures to help everyone to know the truth concerning the place where the believers go
Because of this, we would like to address the inaccurate belief in Christianity concerning the matter of going to a heavenly mansion
Up to this day, among the many children of God there still exists this kind of inaccurate concept concerning going to a heavenly mansion
At a Christian's funeral the pastor or preacher usually says something like this: 'Do not be troubled or sorrowful
We want the gospel, we want the Bible, and we want the Lord Himself, but we do not want Christianity with its organization and doctrines
Let us go back and read from the second half of verse 22 through verse 23: 'And the rich man also died and was buried
Genesis 25:8 says, 'And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of days, and he was gathered to his people'
Verses 34 and 35 of chapter thirtyseven say And Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days
If harm should befall him on the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol'
By this we are clear that the spirits of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Old Testament saints also went to Hades at their death
If we have the time, we can read all the verses in the Old Testament concerning Hades; then we will be clearer
Although he went down to Hades, the Hades where he was was different from the 'Hades' commonly known to people
Between these two sections a great chasm is fixed so that those in one section cannot pass to the other, and vice versa
The section of torment is for the perishing people of the world, whereas the section of comfort is for saved saints
God has arranged a place for the dead ones to be kept until the time of their resurrection when they will put on their body
All dead persons, their bodies being left on earth and their spirits separated from their bodies and becoming naked, go to wait in Hades
Hades is divided into two sections, one section being a place of torment, and the other section being a place of comfort
It is evident that Paradise is the place where the Lord went after His crucifixion and before His resurrection
Perhaps some will say that the Lord being three days and three nights in the heart of the earth refers to His body being buried in the earth
No, the Greek text here is 'the heart of the earth' and does not refer to the place just under the surface of the earth
We will read another passage, and then we will be clearer that after His death the Lord was in Hades for three days
The footnote on Luke 16:23 separates Hades into two states-Hades before the ascension of Christ and Hades since the ascension of Christ
Before Christ's ascension, Hades had two sections occupied by the saved ones and the perished ones respectively, as we have said earlier
Up to the present time the unsaved dead persons are still suffering anguish in Hades, waiting for the coming of the final judgment
After the ascension of Christ, the spirits and souls of the saved ones were moved with the Lord Jesus from Paradise into heaven
Those who hold this kind of interpretation ask, 'Since these souls have been led captive and come back, where should they be put'?
The expositors who were experts in the Greek language told us the meaning here is that the Lord captured the enemy's capturing power
We know that his capturing power is the power of death; death is the power of Satan by which he captures people
Verses 4 to 7 continue, 'That he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak
Based on the Chinese translation it is hard to answer, but if you study the original text, right away you are clear
The phrase may be translated 'was caught up,' or it may be translated 'was caught away,' as some English versions have
Paul said that he was caught away to the third heaven and he was also caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words
If you read this portion carefully, you can see that the third heaven is in heaven and Paradise is under the earth
They cried with a loud voice saying How long O Master holy and true will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth
Even after the Lord's ascension, up to the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up and still said that David had not ascended into the heavens
The Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, 'No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven'
For also in this we groan longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven if indeed being clothed we will not be found naked
God has to put them in another place where they will be comforted and wait to be clothed with a resurrected body
For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon'
Paul's desire was not to be unclothed but to be clothed upon, that is, to have what is mortal swallowed up by life
There are two other verses in the Scriptures that easily stir up arguments and therefore also require our attention
You say that the believers are in Hades after they die, but Paul said that when believers die they are with Christ and that it is far better
At this time even though we have the Lords presence in our spirit this presence is very limited due to the restriction of the physical world
What it means is that we will depart from the physical world and enter into a spiritual world to have more enjoyment of being with the Lord
Generally speaking, you are in America; specifically speaking, you are in one of the numerous places in America
When we depart from the physical world and enter into the spiritual world, it does not necessarily mean that we are in one particular place
If the dead believers are already in heaven waiting for the Lord to bring them with Him at His coming back, do they still need to rise?
When the Lord Jesus comes again, that is also the time of the resurrection of the dead believers, so they will come with the Lord Jesus
At the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus, just as God will bring the Lord Jesus, so also He will bring the dead believers with the Lord
On the one hand, it says the Lord Jesus will descend from heaven, and on the other hand, it says He will come with the dead believers
Do not forget that the rapture to the air at that time is but for a moment, because the New Jerusalem will still descend from heaven
In the Chinese version of the Bible, 'heavenly mansion' is mentioned twice, once in Hebrews 9:24 and again in 1 Peter 3:22
Afterwards, the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven, and God will dwell with us in the New Jerusalem for eternity
If you read Revelation 21, you can see a city there, but you cannot see the people who dwell in it, because the dwellers are the city itself
May God have mercy on us that we may see that the desire of God is to save us into Himself that we may take Him as our dwelling place
Just as the earth is a place of our sojourning, so also Paradise in Hades is a place where we receive temporary comfort
He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire
Verse 3 of chapter thirteen says, 'And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow'
Verses 8 and 9 say, 'But others fell on the good earth and yielded fruit, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold
In this parable of sowing, the Lord shows us more clearly that those whom He saved are His harvest He produced with the seed of life
Verses 2426 say Another parable He set before them saying The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field
Verses 39-43 say, 'And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels
The wheat signifies the righteous; their outcome is that they will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father
On the one hand, the believers are God's farm, God's cultivated land; on the other hand, they are God's house, God's building
On the one hand, the work of the apostles is planting and watering, which naturally refers to the aspect of the farm
On the other hand, the saints are God's house, God's building, so the apostle says that their work is also a building work
Underneath the earth is Hades, and within it is Paradise, the place of Abraham's bosom where the souls of the deceased saints are comforted
Our eternal dwelling place is the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven at the time of the new heaven and new earth
From the time of our resurrection and rapture to the descending of the New Jerusalem from heaven, there will be at most one thousand years
In reading God's Word, however, you can realize that God does not have a place as the goal, but the goal is He Himself
All of the foregoing verses reveal that God's desire is to have man as His habitation and to have man take Him as his habitation
When we come to 1 John, we read such a word: 'In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Holy Spirit'
Later, the Lord Himself also said that the body of His incarnation was the temple of God, or we may say, the house of God
If we look at it simply from Hebrews 11, it seems that the city Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob longed after is a place
On the one hand, she is God's tabernacle, that which is built by God to be the eternal dwelling place of God and man
We have to ask, is the holy city in Hebrews 11 a heavenly mansion, or is it something built with God's redeemed people?
The Lord was in the Father, and through His death and resurrection we were brought into the Father as He was in the Father
The abodes in verse 2 clearly refer not to a physical place but to those whom God gained to be His dwelling place
If you grow into Christ, the Head, in a certain matter, then in that matter you can be built up with the saints
God does not consider us as glass vessels that are good enough if He merely washes us clean with the blood and places us before Him
He has washed us with the blood, but He also wants to come into us to be our life that we may become a living harvest
At that time he was locked away in a Roman prison, and he still said, 'I do not account of myself to have laid hold
We have pointed out to the brothers and sisters that on the one hand, we are God's crop and, on the other hand, we are God's building
There is a sequence to the ripening of the harvest, so the Bible mentions the firstfruits and the reaping of the majority
We all know that the persons, things, and events in the Old Testament are not merely the persons, things, or events themselves
Accordingly, Leviticus 23, in speaking about the feasts to be kept by the children of God, greatly emphasizes the firstfruits and reaping
The account of reaping in the Old Testament points out that if we are to participate in the building of the New Jerusalem, we need to mature
We should not think that a believer, whether he has matured in life or not, will be reaped by the Lord as soon as he dies
It is true that when a believer dies, his body is left in the earth, and his soul is comforted in Paradise in Hades
When the Lord comes again, all the saved ones will resurrect and stand before the judgment seat of Christ to be judged
You should by no means think that since you are saved, you are already a living stone and therefore have already become part of the building
In eternity, in the new heaven and new earth, you will not find a pile of materials around the city of New Jerusalem
It is true that everyone who has been washed by the Lord's blood will eternally be saved and will not perish forever
We have pointed out repeatedly that the issue of God's work throughout the ages is to gain a city, the New Jerusalem
Now you can see that there is the tabernacle, there is the temple , and there is the Bridegroom, who comes for the bride
In the New Testament time this God became flesh, died and resurrected, and also entered into us as the Spirit to be joined to us
In this way, at the end of Revelation you see that the things John mentioned in the beginning have been fully fulfilled
Between Christ's first coming and Christ's second coming is the age of grace, which is also called the church age
When the millennial age ends, the old heaven and the old earth will end, and the new heaven and the new earth begin
Another part of the building of God, which consisted of the twelve tribes of Israel, was built by God in the age of law
Even though the Lord will have come and all things will be restored, the building work of God will still be incomplete at that time
Their typical theology tells people that when the Lord Jesus comes again, all things will be complete; all things will rest in peace
We realize from reading the Bible that the Lord will still do His building work at the time of His second coming
When the Lord comes back, not only will there be discipline, but the discipline may even be greater than before
You should never think that the reason God does not discipline us is because He loves us so much that He is reluctant to discipline us
There is not one child who can avoid being disciplined, but as to when the child is disciplined, it depends on the father's own will
They live as they please, not growing, not being dealt with, not being built, but going through their entire life aimlessly
Before you are dealt with, this brother does not seem lovely and that sister has problems as well; you can never be one with others
A day will come when the Lord will deal with you to such an extent that every brother and sister is lovely in your sight
Their enjoyment of the New Jerusalem will come a thousand years earlier than that of the majority of the believers
The Bible says that when the Lord comes again, the marriage of the Lamb will come, for His wife will have made herself ready
In the millennial kingdom the New Jerusalem is the bride, and in the new heaven and the new earth the New Jerusalem is the wife
The saints who need to be built up by the Lord during the millennial kingdom will not participate in the New Jerusalem as the bride
While you are alive, the earth is where you sojourn; when you die, Paradise in Hades will be where you stay temporarily
When you are resurrected, transfigured, and caught up in the air by the Lord, that will still be a temporary condition
Brothers and sisters, the Bible never tells us that once a person is washed by the blood he is 'going to heaven'
God wants to build Himself into His redeemed people and to build His redeemed people into Himself to accomplish a spiritual building
