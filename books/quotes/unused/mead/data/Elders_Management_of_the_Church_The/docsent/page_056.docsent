   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE DISCERNMENT OF THE ELDERS I. DISCERNMENT AND MANAGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>An elder's ability of discernment is definitely related to the management of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>An elder who has no discernment concerning people and things will surely be unable to manage a church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, a person who is muddled cannot manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The person who manages and oversees must be considerably clear in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you take three as four or four as three, you cannot manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if you were to manage it, your management would be a management of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, either we do not mention church management at all, or if we do, we need to see a basic need, which is the ability of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPHERE OF DISCERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An elder's sphere of discernment differs from that of the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their sphere of discernment is worldly and materialistic, but the elders' sphere of discernment is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is an important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. Discerning Spirituality</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In discerning people and things, the first thing the elders have to determine is whether or not the person or the matter is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For instance, a brother may suggest something to you as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, your job is not to discern if the matter is right or wrong, good or bad, but whether or not it is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is not a social organization or a business institution.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is a spiritual family and a spiritual garden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Business affairs are there only to render some support.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The goal of church administration is to nourish and supply every family member with life, so that each one will grow to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Or to put it in another way, this goal is to render every tree in this garden the adequate nourishment and watering, so that each one will grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, everything in the church must be discerned with spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if some brothers come with suggestions to buy land for a meeting hall, or to build a meeting hall a certain kind of way, the elders must have spiritual discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some brothers may suggest, "We want to send out a notice or an invitation."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders should first discern if this way of doing things is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a very serious principle.</S>
