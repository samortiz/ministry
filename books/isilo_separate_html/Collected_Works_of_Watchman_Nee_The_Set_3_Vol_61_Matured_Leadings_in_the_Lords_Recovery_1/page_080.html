They investigated them even to the bone and marrow. Their searching was in a sense sharper than the two-edged sword, but they were so surprised by our brothers and sisters. They forced others to share everything in common because they were afraid that no one would do it, but we practice this voluntarily. They said that the biblical practice of having everything in common was wrong, and they told the brothers and sisters in Yi-Yang that no one was allowed to practice this. They said that such a practice would make everyone lazy. We practice having everything in common because we love the brothers, but they thought this was wrong because it would encourage laziness. However, even though we have everything in common, we are not lazy. This bewilders them. The world cannot do this, but we can. This is what it means to be a Christian. The world does not understand that Christians are a peculiar people, but this does not mean that we are promoting Christian socialism. We only do this as a practice. Christian conduct is not based on a set of Christian doctrines or creeds, but is according to the life we have received. Christian behavior has nothing to do with doctrines and teachings; it is related to life. The father did not embrace his prodigal son according to a set of rules. When the prodigal son returned, the father spontaneously stepped forward to kiss him. A Christian acts according to the life within him. For this reason, it is impossible for him to take the way of the world.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY</h2><p>In 1925 a British brother in the shipping business received a telegram saying that an eight-thousand-ton ocean liner would arrive in ten days. Another brother was visiting in his house at the time and was about to receive a check for two hundred pounds from him. The check was designated for the work of the gospel. After the visitor left, a telegram arrived and informed the shipping brother that the ship had sunk, along with all the cargo on board. He rang a bell and asked for men to recall the visiting brother. He told him that the ship was lost and that he had to write a new check. He took the old check and wrote another one for five thousand pounds, saying, "Hurry up and go. Spend this on the Lord." The visitor thought that this brother was out of his mind. Having lost his ship, he should have scaled down his giving. He should have changed the two hundred pounds to fifty pounds, but instead he changed the number, adding more zeros to the check. When he was asked to explain his action, he said, "The sinking of the ship is an urgent heavenly telegram from God. He does not want me to accumulate any wealth on earth! Since God does not want me to manage this money, I have to spend it on the Lord while it is still in my hand." The visiting brother took the check with tears and said, "I have never seen anyone do this before."</p><h2 class="head1">DISCERNING THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S COMING<br />AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF CONSECRATION</h2><p>I am saying this to you not for the purpose of fund-raising. I am saying this to let all the brothers and sisters throughout the whole world know that the day of the Lord is approaching! We have to spend whatever we have on the Lord, while the money is still useful. In this passage, James does not tell us the result of the capitalist-worker dispute. That is not his point. He tells us that the Lord is coming! Let me shout again, "The Lord is coming soon!" Perhaps we cannot see other signs, but we can surely see this sign. We have to endure. While the sign is still here, we have to offer up the money we have in our hand. I truly hope that when the Lord comes back the second time, none of us will miss Him again. It is bad enough to miss Him once. It is bad enough to fail once. We must not miss Him the second time. We must not fail the second time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
