   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO HAVE THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is by God s dispensing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ that He obtains a Bride, a wife, composed of all the regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The issue of regeneration in John 3 is a Bride to Christ v. 29 . Christ gained a Bride through God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regeneration in Christ s resurrection is just God dispensing Himself into you, and this dispensing issues in a Bride to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through regeneration all of us are a part of this Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TO BRING HIS BELIEVERS INTO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then Christ in His resurrection brought all His believers into God John 14:16-20; 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Where are you today?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you realize that, as regenerated ones, you are in God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether I am in the U.S.A., or in Hong Kong, or in Stuttgart, my home is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not a superstition; this is a fact!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ in resurrection has brought all of us into God through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO ENTER INTO THE BELIEVERS AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ brought us into God, and at the same time He entered into us as the Spirit John 14:16-17; 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us read John 14:20: In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this verse it is hard to say who is in whom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all are in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, so we also are in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that we are in the Son and in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And the Son is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The dispensing of God has been neglected and missed among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today s Christians mostly stress the ethical teachings such as husbands love your wives, and wives submit yourselves to your husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But eventually no wife can give the proper submission, and no husband can give the proper love apart from God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s recovery is not a matter of human love or submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a matter of the living God dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When, as a husband, you have the living God dispensed into you, surely you will love your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When, as a wife, you have the living God dispensed into you, surely you will submit to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will not be simply your loving or your submitting; this will be Christ living in you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will not be a matter of ethics or religion, but of the living God entering into you as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to be merged in God and to have God merged in you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is to be blended with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the Lord Jesus ministry, the real salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today among most Christians what is taught is mostly ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People are mainly taught to improve their character and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is just ethics; this is not the living Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Lord s recovery we are not teaching people mere ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are ministering Christ in resurrection who is the very God being dispensed into all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not living merely an ethical life; we are living a life that is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christianity has become mostly an ethical religion, but the Lord s recovery is the living God dispensing Himself into all His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our ethics and our morality by the living God are on a much higher level because they are just God Himself living in us and through us and from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>TO ABIDE IN THE BELIEVERS WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THROUGH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After entering into His disciples Christ abides in them with the Father through the Spirit John 14:23, 26; 15:4a, 5a .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He does not only enter into us; He also abides in us for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You need to have the realization that you have the living God now abiding in you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The very Christ in resurrection lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you really see this you could not be so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anyone who realizes that the living God is abiding in him would be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a doctrinal Christ nor merely a historical Christ, but the present Christ, the practical Christ, the very living Christ who is the embodiment of God dispensing Himself into our entire being by abiding in us with the Father through the Spirit.</S>
