<h2 class="head1">HAVING EVERYTHING BUT THE REVELATION</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s zealous service to God was actually in opposition to God and according to Satan&rsquo;s instigation. Some local churches are waning like the setting sun. Only a person without revelation could boast of his prayer and of his love for the Lord in such a situation. Such boasting is an indication that his zeal may actually be in opposition to God. Before Paul encountered the great light on the road to Damascus, he had knowledge, religion, tradition, training, and zeal but no revelation.</p>
<p">According to my observation, the brothers and sisters are in a worrisome condition. Our condition is at least ninety percent the same as Paul&rsquo;s, if not a hundred percent. We have everything but revelation. At a recent bread-breaking meeting, I realized that the brothers have inherited a set way of doing things and that we have picked up some additional ways over the years, including calling on the name of the Lord, pray-reading, and even pray-singing. However, I did not hear a single prayer filled with the flavor of revelation; there were only the same old expressions. Although things were one way a decade ago and may be another way today, there is still no revelation.</p>
<p>First Samuel 3:1-3 says, &ldquo;The boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. Now the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; visions were not widespread. And at that time Eli lay in his place, and his eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see. And the lamp of God had not yet gone out. And Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was.&rdquo; <em>Rare</em> in verse 1 means &ldquo;costly&rdquo; in Hebrew. Some English versions render this word as &ldquo;precious.&rdquo; Something is precious when it is rare. Gold would not be precious if it were found everywhere; gold is valuable only because it is rare. The word of Jehovah was precious because the word of Jehovah was rare. The condition of the meeting that I attended was somewhat like the time of Eli. I heard doctrine but no word of the Lord; I heard set prayers but no words of revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL BEING UNABLE TO SEE<br />
AND NEEDING THE HELP OF OTHERS<br />
BECAUSE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SHINING</h2>
<p>When Paul served in darkness, he was very confident and felt that he was quite correct. He was full of self-confidence. Only a person who is in darkness is certain of himself. Paul was full of self-confidence until a great light came upon him on his way to Damascus (Acts 9:3). When God&rsquo;s light flashed around him, the one who was clear about everything became blind and could see nothing (v. 8).</p>
<p>In Acts 22:11 Paul said, &ldquo;I could not see because of the glory of that light.&rdquo; Although he formerly knew the way, took the lead, and led others, he became confused when the Lord&rsquo;s light shined upon him. He had no sense of direction, and he needed the help of others. Hence, in verse 11 he said, &ldquo;I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.&rdquo; It is a great blessing to have a sense of our need to be led by others; it proves that we have light. The only thing that matters is having revelation and light. Being zealous in our love for the Lord or being an elder or a co-worker does not matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD APPEARING TO PAUL TO IMPART REVELATION</h2>
<p>Paul spoke of the Lord appearing to him when he defended himself before King Agrippa (26:16). Formerly, Paul knew much doctrine, but he did not know God. The Lord appeared to him in order to shine on him. The Lord came to him in the shining of the light. At that time, he was filled with knowledge, but he had no light. The Lord&rsquo;s shining showed Paul that his knowledge was being used by Satan. Paul was blinded and confused by the light, but in this blinding, he received revelation. Often we receive light and revelation when we sense that we cannot see things so clearly in our service. However, we can also be in utter darkness if we think that we know everything, that we can lead others, and that we are superior to others.</p>
<p>In the great light the Lord said to Paul, &ldquo;I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you; delivering you from...the Gentiles, to whom I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God&rdquo; (vv. 16-18). Paul testified to King Agrippa that &ldquo;nothing apart from the things which both the prophets and Moses have said would take place, that the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). Paul testified as one who had been shined upon and received revelation.</p>
