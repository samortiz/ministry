<h1 class="title">LIFE BEING THE LIGHT OF MEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46; Psa. 36:9</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD<br />
TO BE CONTACTED AND OBTAINED BY US</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that life is in the Word. In this chapter we will see that this life is the light of men. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; God being the Word means that God comes forth so that we can comprehend, contact, and obtain Him. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; In this God, who is the Word, is life. Whenever we touch Him and obtain Him, we are enlivened inwardly. We can all testify that when we were saved we touched life, and God was no longer objective to us; He became subjective to us. He is no longer a mysterious, untouchable, unfathomable God but a God who has entered into us as the Word for us to practically contact and obtain. When God contacts us as the Word, we become living, strong, and spontaneously transformed in life. Hence, we can testify that we have life in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING LIGHT TO SHINE IN US</h2>
<p>After speaking of life being in the Word, John continues, saying, &ldquo;The life was the light of men&rdquo; (v. 4). The life in the Word was the light of men. <em>The life was the light</em> is a great word. No comparable word can be found in any book by philosophers or in the various religious writings in the world. The life is the light, and wherever there is life, there is light. Conversely, death is darkness, and wherever there is death, there is darkness. When a person touches death, he is in darkness. Since the life is the light, those who are full of life also have the shining of light. Whoever has life also has light, but whoever loses the sense of life within becomes inwardly dead and dark.</p>
<p>The most wonderful aspect of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; salvation is that God is no longer hidden in mystery. He did not remain in eternity; He is the Word who uttered Himself forth, speaking Himself into His believers. The Christian life begins with believing in the gospel. The gospel is the word of God; the gospel is God speaking to us. The content of the gospel is the Lord Jesus Himself. When we heard the gospel and were moved, we contacted the Spirit, we contacted the Lord Jesus, and we contacted God. When we opened to the Lord and believed in Him, receiving the word of the gospel, we received God Himself. Our believing and receiving made us living. We may have been sorrowful, but we became joyful when we received the word of the gospel. We may have been depressed, even to the point of considering suicide, but we were uplifted within when we received the word of the gospel. We felt that we were inwardly full of light, and we were willing to live on the earth for God. Furthermore, we also discovered the strength and limitlessness of this life. When we received the word of the gospel, we received the life in the Word. Now we can endure what others cannot endure and bear what others cannot bear, because God as the Word has entered into us to be our life. This life enables us to live a heavenly life on earth, living a life that others cannot live and taking a way that others cannot take.</p>
<p>We also can testify that whenever we touch this life, light shines brightly within us. Before we believed in the Lord, we were not only dead but fully in darkness. Our way was uncertain, and our life was without meaning. Our whole being was in darkness and filled with sorrow, pain, oppression, dejection, hopelessness, and utter despair. We were dead and in darkness until we heard the gospel, believed in the Lord, and received His word into us. Then we were enlivened and filled with light. We became inwardly clear, and the light within us was shining and illuminating the way of glory before us. Our life became bright and full of hope. The shining of light, which began in this age, will continue to the next age and from today unto eternity. This is indeed marvelous.</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.&rdquo; The light of dawn has been rising in us since the day of our salvation. The more we draw near to the Lord Jesus, have fellowship with Him, pray to Him, read His Word, and live in the Spirit, the brighter the shining will be in us. It is like the rising sun at dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day. The light within us shines not only upon great matters but also upon small matters. From things high to low, the light shines on everything. When the light shines, nothing is in the dark, and nothing is unclear and confused. All things related to our parents, our spouse, our children, our relatives, our colleagues, and even our clothing, food, housing, transportation, and money become transparent and clear. When we are in the light, we know where we are, what we should do, and where we are going. This is the condition of those who have the light that comes from receiving the life that is in the Lord as the Word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
