<h2 class="head1">THEY WILL NOT HUNGER OR THIRST</h2><p>To hunger and thirst is to have a hope that is not yet satisfied. Who are the ones who will not hunger and thirst? "Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" (John 6:35). "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (4:14). Christ promises that everyone who believes in Him will be satisfied and receive a satisfying life. It is not us satisfying ourselves with Christ but Christ becoming our satisfaction. The world can only satisfy us temporarily; it can only satisfy us for a moment. It cannot satisfy us forever. "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (vv. 13-14). This is the Lord's word.</p><p>God does not say that we can be satisfied only when we reach heaven. We can be satisfied even today. Do we believe that we will not hunger and thirst today, just as we will not be hungry and thirsty in heaven? Today the Lord Jesus can satisfy our heart as much as He will satisfy us on that day in heaven. The Lord said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever." Once we drink, we are satisfied. This satisfying life can be ours today.</p><h2 class="head1">NEITHER WILL THE SCORCHING HEAT <br />NOR SUN STRIKE THEM</h2><p>Those who live in subtropical lands do not feel the scorching of the heat and the sun. But if one travels to tropical lands, he will realize the intensity of the striking from the heat and the sun. A brother once said that when a man walks out of the house without his umbrella in a tropical country, he will be sick for a few months. Once three people went to a certain land. Two of them died of heat on the way; only one survived. However, if one is inside a house, he will not be hurt by the sun because there is a shelter. Without a shelter, one will be hurt by the heat. The Bible mentions God's overshadowing as a kind of shelter. There is one kind of life that is under God's overshadowing; it is a life that is hidden in God (Psa. 36:7-9).</p><p>Are you sheltered? In spiritual warfare, we have the helmet of salvation (Eph. 6:17). Our life is a hidden life. We are hidden under God's wings on earth today as little chickens are hidden under the wings of their mother. In Psalm 91, we find that those who dwell "in the secret place of the Most High/Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty" (v. 1). The Lord will deliver these ones from many perils. This is a blessed life. We are a sheltered people.</p><h2 class="head1">HE WHO HAS MERCY ON THEM WILL SHEPHERD<br />AND GUIDE THEM TO SPRINGS OF WATERS OF LIFE</h2><p>Springs are with God (Psa. 87:7), while the river of water of life flows from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). In other words, we are very close to God; we are right beside Him. God leads us to His presence, and the Lamb shepherds us. To put it another way, it is the Lamb who shepherds; it is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who feeds the lambs with His experience as the Lamb of God. We can never improve ourselves. We need a Shepherd to feed us all the time. What a restful enjoyment this is! This again is something that we can enjoy today.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES</h2><p>Today we can enjoy the three blessings above. But this does not mean that we will have no tears. We have to wait until we reach heaven before our tears will be wiped away. Isaiah 49:10 does not mention this kind of blessing because it records the condition on earth. Our Lord Jesus was completely restful while He was on earth; He could walk through all difficulties. Yet He wept beside the tomb of Lazarus, and He also wept on His way to Jerusalem. Finally, He wept in Gethsemane. Hebrews 5 says that He prayed "with strong crying and tears" (v. 7). This shows that tears are unavoidable in this age. However, our tears are put into God's bottle and recorded in His book (Psa. 56:8). One Christian said that even though tears are bitter, God remembers them; therefore, they are a blessing!</p><p>Although we cannot avoid tears today, if we believe in God's word, we can be satisfied, and we can have God's sheltering and the Lord's shepherding. God has promised that we can enjoy these three items of blessings today.</p>
