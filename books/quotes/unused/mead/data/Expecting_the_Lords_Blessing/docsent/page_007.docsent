   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>O brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must learn to live in God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is good to work and do things, but we must have our capacity increased.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must ask God to keep us in His blessing in our work and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not resolve this problem, our work will be severely damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Witness was in Shanghai in 1945.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day he said that the brothers' meeting experienced great blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that Brother Witness has made some progress in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must come before God to see that we do not expect the results of our labor, but expect God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes there are some results from our work, but they are dry and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we expect God's blessing, many things will happen that are beyond our expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we wait upon God's blessing, things will happen beyond our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must continually look for miracles and unexpected occurrences in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not keep expecting that we will be able to bear any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our expectation of that small amount of fruit limits God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not expect God's blessing, there is not much hope for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will have financial difficulties, and it will be difficult for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we should not look for results commensurate with our individual labor, but we should look for God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we only look for commensurate results, I do not know how many years it will take for many people to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must always look for God to do things beyond our expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must ask God to give us the vision to see the meaning of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some are checking to see whether or not the young people are doing things right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we should be checking to see if a person is being blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a person can be blessed by God, we do not know how much more fruit he will bear beyond just his gift and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If he does not have the blessing, his carefulness and labor will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people are blessed by God, and other people are not blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may have a better temper and a larger gift than a certain brother, but he bears fruit in his work, while we cannot bear fruit in ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We look down on many people because we are better, yet God blesses them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot say that God is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize that before God, we are those whom He cannot bless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not become angry or jealous about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, we should judge ourselves soberly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have many excuses, and so do our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are right, and so are they.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what can we do if God does not bless?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are right, but we cannot win souls.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are right, but the church is not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are right, but it is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must eliminate all the things that stop and frustrate the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From now on we should not be those who stubbornly argue over right and wrong; we must be those who receive great blessings from God.</S>
