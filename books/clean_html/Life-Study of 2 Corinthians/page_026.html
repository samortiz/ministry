<h2 class="head3">1. Afflicted in Every Way, but Not Straightened</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul says, &ldquo;We are afflicted in every way, but not straitened; perplexed, but not despairing.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; can also be translated pressed on every side. The word straitened also means cramped. This description of the apostles&rsquo; life from this verse through verse 18 shows that they lived a crucified life in resurrection, or the resurrection life under the killing of the cross, for the carrying out of their ministry.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Perplexed, but Not Despairing</h2><p>Literally, perplexed here means unable to find a way out. The word translated despairing literally means utterly unable to find a way out; that is, the way is entirely shut up. Here the apostle is saying they were perplexed, unable to find a way out, yet not despairing, not utterly unable to find a way out.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Persecuted, but Not Forsaken</h2><p>Verse 9a says, &ldquo;Persecuted, but not forsaken.&rdquo; The Greek word for persecuted also means pursued by enemies. To be forsaken is to be abandoned, deserted; literally, it means to be left behind in some evil plight.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Cast Down, but Not Destroyed</h2><p>Verse 9b says, &ldquo;Cast down, but not destroyed.&rdquo; Cast down also means struck down, and destroyed also means perishing, as in verse 3, that is, killed.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Bearing About in the Body<br />the Putting to Death of Jesus</h2><p>Verse 10 continues, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.&rdquo; The putting to death here means the killing, the deadening, that is, the working of death, the working of the cross, which the Lord Jesus suffered and endured. When the Lord was on earth, He was daily under the killing. Day by day He experienced being put to death. The apostles also experienced this. Daily they were under the killing; daily they were being put to death.</p><p>The apostles experienced this killing work &ldquo;that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.&rdquo; The word rendered &ldquo;that&rdquo; also means in order that, resulting in. The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of resurrection life. This daily killing is to release the divine life in resurrection. The life in verse 10 is the resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross.</p><p>The continual daily grinding works for a specific purpose: that the life of Jesus might be manifested in our body. This life is resurrection life. The Lord Jesus lived resurrection life even before He was crucified. The life He lived on earth was a life of resurrection. This resurrection life is a life that can withstand being put to death.</p><p>In verse 11, Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.&rdquo; The title Jesus in verses 10 and 11 implies that the apostles lived a life as the Lord Jesus did on earth, a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life. The interchangeable use of &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; and &ldquo;body&rdquo; in these verses indicates that the mortal flesh is in our fallen body.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Death Operating in Them,<br />but Life in the Believers</h2><p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; When we are under the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others. The impartation of life into others is always the issue of our suffering the killing of the cross. In verse 12 Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;We are dying, but you Corinthians are being made alive. Our dying infuses life into you and makes you alive. For us, it is a matter of being put to death; for you, it is a matter of the impartation of life.&rdquo;</p>
