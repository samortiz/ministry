I cannot release my burden for the meetings, so I feel that I should remain in Ch'ang-sha temporarily. Brother Lan Tsi-yi wanted me to completely drop everything regarding the meetings in Ch'ang-sha when I was in Hankow. He asked me whether I could go to Hankow to help with the Gospel Book Room and to rest. However, I do not have any inward leading to take his suggestion. The ministry which I have received from the Lord is to serve the orphans. The Lord has not yet given me a vision concerning this work, yet I have had the faith to do it all along. Many times the brothers have seen that the burden of caring for my family is heavy and have exhorted me to do some other work. Now some brothers exhort me that it would be better for me to get a job. Yet I was not touched. Glory be to our rich Father. Since He led me to leave the orphanage, the flour in my jar and the oil in my pitcher have never run short. With regard to my health, I had a relapse of my illness in July of last year. I spent more than a month recovering and have not had a relapse since. My condition seems to be much improved from last year. A brother from Chi-Loo University (an internist) gave me a physical examination. He could not see any sign of tuberculosis during his careful examination. In my working and moving about, I have found my physical strength much weaker than before. I used to walk nineteen to twenty-two miles a day and work the entire day without feeling tired. Now I find it difficult to walk for three miles, and I must rest after working for an hour. I do not know what attitude I should have toward my health, the church, and my future. I am telling you these things with the hope that you will render me help with your direct words.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Ai-wu<br />May 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Han Fu-sheng<br />during His Illness</h2><p>I was transferred from Ren-Shu Hospital to Siang-Ya Hospital five days ago. Everything is progressing well. Because my illness is so peculiar, I had to go through many tests. This has been a real suffering to me. At first the doctors said that I had a tumor in my lungs. Then they thought that water in my lungs had made my chest swell. They have attempted to draw off fluid many times, but with no result. Last night they discovered a pocket of pus under my ribs when they poked me with a needle. Surgery is a necessity now. Please pray for me. Ask the Lord to give me grace to get through this. My heart is still peaceful and secure. I am resting in the Lord's bosom. I have given everything to the Lord, so I have nothing to be anxious about. I deeply believe that whatever happens to me is the Lord's will. He would not allow me to suffer unnecessarily! My mouth praises the Lord unceasingly for giving me an opportunity to enjoy His grace and love more! Hallelujah!</p><p>Han Fu-sheng<br />May 16</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_147.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_149.html">Next</a> </body></html>
