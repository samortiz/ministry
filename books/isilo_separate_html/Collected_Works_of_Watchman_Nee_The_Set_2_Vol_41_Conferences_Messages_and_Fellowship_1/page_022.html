Although the hollow of his thigh was touched, he spoke to the angel, saying, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me" (v. 26). Although Jacob was ruthless, his disposition met the condition for God's blessing; he was desperately seeking. If God did not bless him, he would not let God go. As a result, God had to bless him. In the New Testament, Paul was the same type of person. He risked his life to become an apostle to the Gentiles (Acts 20:24). As a result, he received much blessing from God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD BLESSING THOSE WHO ARE DESPERATE</h2><p>Many people are not hungry for God. They are not desperate to pursue after God, yet they put all the blame on the leading brothers. They do not grow spiritually, yet they blame their lack of growth on the other brothers. They are dissatisfied, but they are not hungry. The manifestations of dissatisfaction are discouragement and withdrawal. All those who are genuinely hungry are desperate to pursue after God. God's blessing is surely with these people. A preacher once said to the Lord, "O God, if You do not fill me up, I will quit preaching." He was discouraged and told God that he would not be a preacher anymore unless God filled him up. This is dissatisfaction; it is not being hungry. Another lady preacher told the Lord, "O God, if You do not fill me up, I will die." She was after God; she was serious with God, and she would not let God go. This is the kind of people that God blesses. Their hearts are hungry, and their attitude is desperate. God's riches will not fail to fill up these emptied vessels.</p><p>You have come to attend this conference at this time. What do you want from the Lord? What do you expect the Lord to fill you with? Do you have any sin which you are not able to overcome? Are you here to ask the Lord to do something for you? Do you have a temper which plagues you? Have you come for the Lord to liberate you? Are you defeated by your love for the world? Do you have dozens or even hundreds of other sins that you are not able to overcome? If your thoughts are unclean, if you cannot overcome your disposition, if you do not have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord, if you are afraid to pray, or if you see no result to your work, now is the time for you to ask the Lord to give you the abundant life and fill you up with the Spirit. If you ask of the Lord, He will bless you abundantly, and the Spirit will fill you up.</p><p>Although spiritual blessings come without a price and are free, the Lord will not scatter them on the street and let people pick them up mindlessly. The Lord's blessings are for those who want them; He does not give to those who do not want them. The three friends of Daniel who were thrown into the fiery furnace said to Nebuchadnezzar, "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up" (Dan. 3:17-18). The words "But if He does not" speak of their absoluteness towards God. They risked their lives and were not afraid to die. God cannot do anything except to bless this kind of people. God has to reveal Himself to such ones.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to pray for God to dig in us, empty us, and create a hunger in us. God fills the hungry with good things. If we are emptied, hungry, and desperate, God will fill us up abundantly, and we will be fully satisfied.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
