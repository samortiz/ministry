   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING CHRIST IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we are gathered together into His name, we need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 5:19 and in Colossians 3:16 the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not mainly for singing but for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition to singing the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we need to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Due to our background, we do not have the habit of speaking the hymns and songs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must pick up this habit and forget about our background, what we have learned in the past, and about our present environment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must come back to the pure word in the Bible concerning how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament reveals that the unique thing we have to do in the meeting is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to speak with the Lord s word, with psalms, with hymns, and with spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all must learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When many Christians come together to meet, they are there to be dumb, to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of the ones meeting together hire a speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not realize, however, that their function to speak is killed by that one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us do not get ourselves prepared to come to the meeting to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, we merely come to the meeting to sit and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not used to bringing our mouth to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To merely come to the meeting to hear what another person would say is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come to the meeting, we should get ourselves prepared to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason why the situation among many Christians today is so weak, poor, low, cold, and far off is altogether due to the lack of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we all would learn to revolt against this kind of silence and speak for Christ, speak forth Christ, and speak Christ, immediately revival would come in.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I come to a meeting for ministry and everybody is silent, this silence nearly quenches me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When everybody would not speak, it is hard for me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, if everybody speaks and I have to fight to get a chance to speak, I am stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are the only one on a basketball team who plays, there is no encouragement for you to play and it is hard for you to play.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose, however, that every member of the team is playing and coordinating together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My burden is to stir you up to revolt against the silence in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Forget about the Christianity way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you come to the meeting, you should be prepared to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must speak in the meeting, but you should not speak your own word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have to learn to speak Christ as our word, the Word of God, and to speak His word, the word as revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To speak in this way we must experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we experience Him, the more we have to say of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not merely say something concerning Him but we must say Him ; we must say something that is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to speak the Christ whom we have experienced in our daily life, and then we have to speak His word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Colossians 3:16 says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the word to dwell in us richly we need to learn the word by studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>BEING FILLED WITH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TO ACQUIRE AN ADEQUATE DIVINE VOCABULARY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After Jesus had been conceived in the womb of Mary, she went to visit her relative Elizabeth, and during this visit she offered a praise to God Luke 1:46-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mary s poetic praise is composed of many quotations from the Old Testament, which indicate strongly that she was very familiar with the word of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She probably studied the Old Testament thoroughly in order to pick up the various points and terms which composed her praise to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that Mary was a godly woman, qualified to be a channel for the Savior s incarnation, and that Jesus would grow up in a family which would be filled with the knowledge and love of God s holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tragic thing about most Christian meetings is that very few of the attendants have an adequate knowledge of God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are not so familiar with God s divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if the attendants have the inspiration, they do not have the words to express their inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person needs an adequate vocabulary to compose, utter, and express his thought.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the proper vocabulary, it is very difficult to utter our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I encourage all of you to revolt against the traditional practice of Christian meeting and come to the meeting and learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To speak, however, you must acquire the adequate vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You can acquire an adequate divine vocabulary from your experiences of Christ, from the Bible, especially from the New Testament, from the Life-study Messages, and from the notes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Life-studies and in the notes of the Recovery Version are many high, deep, and profound terms which we should learn and use.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In describing the wonderful Spirit which we have received and which we now enjoy we have used seven marvelous adjectives.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The New Testament clearly reveals that this Spirit is all-inclusive, processed, compound, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the ones among us who are under twenty-five years of age are in a golden time to acquire a rich spiritual vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you are rich in vocabulary, it is easy for you to compose any sentence, any paragraph, and any article.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must spend time to increase our spiritual vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is regretful that many of us are short of divine utterance and expression.</S>
