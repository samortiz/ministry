   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suffering Rebellion from Those among Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Nee also suffered attacks from rebellious ones who were among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was younger, I read the stories about the children of Israel rebelling against Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I came into the church life, I saw such rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee suffered not only the attacks from the outsiders but also the attacks and rebellion from those inside the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would like to present an example of such attacks suffered by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was a co-worker among us who fell into immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The local leading ones could not handle the situation, so they referred the case to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Nee was forced to deal with this situation, and this brother had to be removed from the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later this brother, who had been a co-worker, started to attack Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, he went to Hong Kong to set up another meeting, which was another division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That meeting was set up close to Brother K.H. Weigh's home, but it did not last too long because this rebellious brother eventually died of cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before he died, he attacked Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was during the Second World War when Shanghai was taken over by the Japanese army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Japanese army was afraid of the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When they found out that someone was a Communist, they killed him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time the Japanese military police were careful to examine all the mail.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When this rebellious brother was in Hong Kong, he sent Brother Nee materials concerning communism so that the Japanese military would think Brother Nee was a communist and arrest him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Nee, however, was under the protection of the Lord, and this mail that was sent to him several times was never discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suffering Defamation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and Evil Report from Opposers</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Nee suffered such attacks from rebellious ones many times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1950 Brother Nee came out of China to Hong Kong for the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Hong Kong we were holding meetings every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One night when Brother Nee and I walked out of the meeting hall, there were some people standing at the entrance distributing some booklets against him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some of these booklets were passed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He smiled a little bit and did not take them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were filled with false rumors and other defamatory things that were absolutely against him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is another illustration of the attacks he suffered.</S>
