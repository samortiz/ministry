<h1 class="title">&ldquo;ONE DIED FOR ALL&rdquo;</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 2 Cor. 5:14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The One is Jesus
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus is God coming to be the Savior of mankind.</li>
	<li>Since He is God incarnated, He is an unlimited person.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s eyes, all who believe in Jesus are included in Jesus. So Jesus is not only an unlimited person, but One that includes all.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All are sinners
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the people in the world are sinners.</li>
	<li>Every sinner that believes in the Lord Jesus is included in this &ldquo;all.&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>One died for all
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Apparently Jesus died as one individual, yet actually He died for all. That is, He died for those He redeemed, for all those who believe in Him.</li>
	<li>The reason that the Lord&rsquo;s death could become effective for all who believe in Him is that He is one with them and they are joined unto Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All died
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;All&rdquo; refers to all those who are joined unto Christ Jesus. Since He died, all have died in God&rsquo;s sight. It is best to use the example of a nation destroyed.</li>
	<li>Since all died because of His death, &ldquo;all&rdquo; do not need to die again.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to share in Jesus&rsquo; death<br />
