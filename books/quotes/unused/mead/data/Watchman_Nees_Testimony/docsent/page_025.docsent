   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Looking to God for Sustenance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Publication Work</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people would never enter a meeting place to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, in 1922 I began printing gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel must be delivered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After writing the tracts, I began praying and asking for provision for the printing and distribution expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God said to me, "If you wish Me to answer your prayer, you must first rid yourself of all hindrances."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the following Sunday, I preached on the theme, "Removal of All Hindrances."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that very time many people were criticizing the wife of one of my co-workers, who was a sister among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the meeting she stood at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I entered the meeting to deliver the message, I looked at her and inwardly criticized her, considering others' criticism of her to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I left the meeting hall after delivering the message, I greeted her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, when I again supplicated God for printing expenses, saying that I had removed all hindrances, God said to me, "What is the message which you have delivered?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have criticized that sister; that is a hindrance to prayer, a hindrance which you ought to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must go to her and confess your guilt."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I replied, "It is not necessary to confess to others sins that are in the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God answered, "Yes, that is right, but your condition is different."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Afterward, when I considered confessing to her and came face to face with the issue, I hesitated five times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though I wished to do it, I was concerned that she, who had always greatly admired me, would then despise me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I said to God, "If You order me to do anything else, I will do it, but I am unwilling to confess to her."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I continued to ask God for the printing expenses, but He would not listen to my reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, He insisted on my confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sixth time, through the Lord's grace, I confessed to her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With tears we both confessed our faults and then forgave each other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were filled with joy and thereafter loved each other all the more in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Shortly after this, the postman delivered a letter containing fifteen U.S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The letter read, "I like to distribute gospel tracts and feel constrained to assist you in the matter of printing gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please accept my gift."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as all hindrances were removed, God answered my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was my first experience of God's answering my prayer in the matter of printing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were then handing out more than a thousand tracts daily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Two or three million copies were printed and distributed annually to supply the churches in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the few years after the publication work was begun, God always answered my prayers and supplied all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord also wanted me to publish the magazine The Present Testimony and to give it out free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time all spiritual periodicals throughout China were for sale; only what I published was free.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The editing room where I wrote the manuscripts was a small cubicle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the manuscripts were completed, they were sent to the press.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there were no funds available, I would pray to God for His provision for printing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I considered what I was doing, I laughed because the manuscripts were being sent to the press without the necessary funds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as I live, I will never forget the time when I had no sooner finished laughing than there was a knock at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Upon opening the door, I saw a middle-aged woman who constantly came to the meetings but to whom my heart was unusually cool.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She was wealthy, but she loved money and treated a dime as a dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I wondered how she could possibly be the one who would give money for printing the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then I asked her why she had come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She replied, "About an hour ago I began feeling inwardly uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I prayed to God, He told me that I am not like a Christian, for I have never done well in the matter of offering, and that I love money too much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I asked Him what He wanted me to do, and He said, 'You should offer some money for the use of My work.'"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then she took out thirty silver dollars and placed them on the table, saying, "Spend it on whatever you feel the need is."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then as I looked at the table, I saw two things, the manuscripts and the money.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I thanked the Lord without thanking her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She left, and I went immediately to the printers to negotiate the printing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The money she had given was sufficient to print fourteen hundred copies of the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Others gave money for the packing expenses and postage.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now about seven thousand copies of each issue are being printed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the finances required are provided by God at the right time and in the way I have been relating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have never solicited contributions from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At times people have even begged me to accept money.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In all of these matters I have been looking solely to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>ACCEPTING MONEY ON CHRIST'S BEHALF</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If one fails in dealing properly with monetary matters, he will also certainly fail in many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must single-mindedly look to God and never do anything which will bring disgrace to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When people give us money, we accept it on behalf of Christ, and we must never ask people for any favors.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thanks be to God that after I told my parents I was not going to spend their money any longer, I was still able to study at school for two more years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Though I did not know where the sustenance came from, whenever there was a need, God certainly provided.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes the situation looked really difficult, yet God never let me down.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We often place our hope in other people, but God does not want us to look to others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should learn a lesson: spend as we receive, and never be like the Dead Sea, with inlets but without a single outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We ought to be like the river Jordan, with inlets on the one side and outlets on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Levites in the Old Testament were those who devoted themselves to serving God, and they too had to offer their tithes.</S>
