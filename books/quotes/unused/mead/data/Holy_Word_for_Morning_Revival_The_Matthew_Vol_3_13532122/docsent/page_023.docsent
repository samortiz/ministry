   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 14 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 18:1-4, 6, 10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest 1 in the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>10 See that you do not despise one of these little ones</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapters eighteen, nineteen, and twenty are a distinct section of the Gospel of Matthew dealing with the relationships among the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These five matters are: pride, our inability to forgive others the root of which lies in our dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these problems are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we would get into the depths of these chapters, we would certainly be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For instance, we would see that we are people full of pride and that anger is hidden in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how patient or forbearing we try to be, anger is still deeply rooted in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what makes it difficult for us to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, we are troubled by lust and riches, both of which damage the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, there is the problem of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew purposely covers these five problems in his Gospel to show that we must take care of them in order to be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Pride, dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition are all "scorpions."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need a divine pest control to kill these "scorpions."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the kingdom life, humility is required 18:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle, all the kingdom people must be little children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be humble is to be like a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are not humble, we will either be offended by others or we will offend others, that is, we will either be stumbled by others or stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All stumbling takes place because of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we were not proud, we would not be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a little child is offended, the offense will be forgotten in just a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But once adults are offended, they are stumbled because of their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the stumbling we cause to others also issues from our pride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a serious matter to stumble someone v. 6 . In these verses the Lord warns us to deal with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the hand, the foot, or the eye causes us to stumble vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>8-9 , we must deal with these causes of stumbling in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to be in the proper kingdom life, we need to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will not be stumbled or be a cause of stumbling to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All stumbling must be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter how small we are, we are lovely in the eyes of the Father, and He cares for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not like to see anyone stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We so easily offend the little ones for whom the Father cares, and as little ones ourselves we are easily stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would avoid being stumbled and stumbling others, we need to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Humility will rescue us.</S>
