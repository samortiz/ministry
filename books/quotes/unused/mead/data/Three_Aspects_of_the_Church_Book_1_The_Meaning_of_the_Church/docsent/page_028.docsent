   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 2 ASENATH, ZIPPORAH, RUTH, AND ABIGAIL Asenath Typifying the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Gained from the World</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many women in the Old Testament, but not all of them are types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether a woman in the Old Testament can be considered a type of the church is determined by her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If her husband is a type of Christ, she can be considered as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eve is a type of the church because her husband, Adam, typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rebekah is a type of the church because she was matched with Isaac, a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Adam and Eve in Genesis are the first couple in which the husband typifies Christ and the wife typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second couple is Isaac and Rebekah, and the third couple is Joseph and Asenath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is difficult to find a basis in the New Testament for saying that Joseph typifies Christ, according to the record in Genesis Joseph s entire life experience was exactly the same as Christ s. Therefore, Joseph is a type of Christ, and his wife, Asenath, is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Joseph typifies Christ in seven aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, Joseph was loved by Jacob more than all of his brothers Gen 37:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Similarly, the Lord Jesus is the Beloved of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospels record God s speaking concerning the Lord Jesus: This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight Matt 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, Joseph was conspired against by his brothers Gen 37:18 , just as our Lord Jesus was killed by the Jews, His brothers in the flesh John 19:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Third, Joseph s brothers conspired against him out of jealousy Gen 37:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, the Jews killed the Lord Jesus out of envy Matt 27:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fourth, Joseph s brothers sought to put him to death, but God raised up the environment to deliver him Gen 37:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews also sought to put the Lord Jesus to death, but God raised Him from the dead with His mighty hand Matt 28:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fifth, after Joseph was forsaken by his brothers, the Gentiles received him Gen 39:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, the Jews forsook the Lord Jesus, but the Gentiles received Him Matt 15:21-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sixth, Joseph supplied the people in Egypt with food so that they were able to avoid death Gen 41:56-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, after our Lord Jesus was forsaken by the Jews, He became the Savior who supplies men with the bread of life that men might not perish John 6:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Seventh, when Joseph was put into prison, he and the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers were condemned, but in the end the cupbearer lived and the baker died Gen 40:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Similarly, when the Lord Jesus was nailed to the cross, two criminals were crucified with Him, and in the end one was saved and the other perished Luke 23:32, 39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the experiences of Joseph are similar in detail to the experiences of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, there is no doubt that Joseph is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His wife, Asenath, therefore, is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Asenath typifies the church being personally gained by Christ out of the world Gen 41:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is in contrast to the experience of Rebekah as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rebekah typifies the Holy Spirit s choosing and calling of the church out from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the type of Rebekah, Isaac remained in the land of Canaan and did not go down to Paddan-aram to search for Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This implies that Christ had not yet come to the world but was still in His heavenly tent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was the Holy Spirit who came to Paddan-aram, called out the church, and led her to go forward unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When it was close to evening, Isaac came out of his tent and met Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that the type of Rebekah centers on Christ being in the heavens and the Holy Spirit calling the church out from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The type of Asenath, however, centers on the church being gained by Christ in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joseph went down to Egypt and took Asenath as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He then stayed in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Asenath never left Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This typifies that Christ came into the world and was received by men as the Savior; He gained the church in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though Asenath continued to live in Egypt, she no longer belonged to Egypt because of her marriage to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same way, even though the church is in the world, she does not belong to the world because of her union with Christ.</S>
