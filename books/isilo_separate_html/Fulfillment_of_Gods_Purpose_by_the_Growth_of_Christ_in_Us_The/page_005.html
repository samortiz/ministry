It is impossible for us human beings to fulfill the divine purpose. But God's intention is that He be taken into us as our life. We need to help people realize how we can take God in as our life. God the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is within us. We received the Spirit of life into us when we repented to the Lord, believed into Him, and called upon His name. When we heard the gospel, we called, "O Lord Jesus." We did this because the Bible tells us we have to call on the name of the Lord. "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Rom. 10:13). When we heard the gospel, many of us did have a kind of desire to call on the Lord. We may have called by saying, "O Lord Jesus," "Jesus," "O Lord," or "Jesus Christ." When you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, that is according to the Bible and according to the inspiration within you.</P><P>The Holy Spirit within you is absolutely one with the Holy Bible outside of you. What you need is to mingle the Holy Spirit within with the Holy Bible without. You need to open up your mouth and say from deep within, "O Lord Jesus." Here is the principle of how to mingle the Spirit with the Bible, making the Holy Bible one with the Holy Spirit. Eventually, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word (Eph. 6:17).</P><P>The Spirit is the consummate Person of the Godhead, because the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us. The Bible is the breath of God. All the Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). The breath of God is also the Spirit (John 20:22). Thus, we have the Holy Spirit within us as the consummate Person of the Godhead, and we have the Bible in our hand, both as God's divine breath. These two items are waiting for our calling on the name of the Lord.</P><P>This is why we need pray-reading. Pray-reading is the best way of calling. To pray is to utter something from the Spirit within. To read is to repeat what is written in the Holy Bible. We need praying and reading mingled together as one, that is, pray-reading. This is the best way to mingle the Holy Spirit with the Holy Bible into one, and this is the best way to make the Holy Bible one with the Holy Spirit. By this pray-reading, by this way of mingling the Bible with the Spirit as one, we take God into us again and again. We enjoy Him as our food (John 6:57).</P><P>My burden is not to pass on more knowledge to you. My burden is to point out to you the prevailing way that you can enjoy God, that you can take God into you, not only as life but also as the life supply. What you need today is just to take God into you again and again. All that we need is the Triune God: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Do not think that the Bible is a book of knowledge. The Bible is the embodiment of God's divine breath. God's divine breath is condensed in the Bible. God's intention is not to pass on knowledge through the Bible; God's intention is to pass on Himself through the Bible. We take God into us through the Bible by pray-reading. The more you pray-read, the more you breathe God in. The more you pray-read, the more you drink of Him (John 7:37). The more you pray-read, the more you eat of Him (Jer. 15:16). In other words, the more you pray-read, the more you take Him in. When God gets into you, He will do a lot of things. The divine life operates within us in many things to fulfill God's purpose (Phil. 2:13).</P><P>We need to drop the religious concept and come back to God's concept. What we need is just to take Him in, and the way to take Him in is to mingle the Holy Spirit with the Holy Bible as one. Then we may enjoy all the riches of the Godhead as our life and as our life supply.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
