<h1 class="title">THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP<br />
ISSUING IN THE BUILDING<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:5-6; 5:8-10; 20:6; 22:1-2; Heb. 10:19-20; 4:14-16; Zech. 6:12-13</h1>
<p>In order for the church to be built up, our spirit must be released and blended into one, because the building of God is carried out through the saints being blended into one in the flow of the Spirit, which is the flow of the water of life. The believers who allow the Spirit of life to flow out from within them are priests. In the Old Testament the building of the tabernacle and of the temple, including its recovery, depended upon the priesthood. Only when there are persons serving God as priests, can the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place be carried out. The Lord Jesus is the Builder of the temple of God. He is building the temple by bearing the priesthood. He is full of the honor and glory of the priesthood.</p>
<p>The building of the church depends on whether or not the saints will bear the priesthood before God. Only the priests draw near to God, touch the throne of God, and allow God to flow through them. The water of life can flow through them and into other persons. The flowing of the water of life is the only way that builds up the church of God.</p>
<p>When God does a work of recovery, the recovery of His Word is crucial. When the children of Israel returned from the land of captivity to Jerusalem, they needed Ezra to open the book of law and read the Word of God so that they might know God according to His Word (Neh. 8:1-6). In the process of building the church, we need the opening of the Word of God so that God&rsquo;s children may see what God is doing in this age and know how God is carrying out the building work. We hope that through these messages the Spirit will bring us into the spirit of the priesthood. The priests are the only people that God needs. The believers are priests, and they need to bear the priesthood by entering into the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of God, and allowing God to flow through them.</p>
<p>Let us consider this matter as presented in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND<br />
THE LINE OF THE KINGSHIP</h2>
<p>God created man in His image so that man would be His expression, and He gave dominion to man so that man would be His representation (Gen. 1:26). When the Bible speaks of man, it first speaks of image and dominion, showing that God cares for His image and dominion in man.</p>
<p>The line of image is the line of the priesthood, because only when man draws near to God and allows God to flow through him can God&rsquo;s image be expressed. Moses remained in the presence of God and fellowshipped with God for forty days. As a result, he was saturated with God, and his face was shining (Exo. 34:28-30). In those forty days Moses was with God as a priest. He put aside all other matters and remained with God. He lived in the presence of God, touched God, and allowed God to flow through him and saturate him so that his whole being was filled with the glory of God. This shows that those who bear the image of God live the life of a priest in a practical way.</p>
<p>It is easy to associate the line of dominion with the line of the kingship, because a king receives authority from God in order to reign for God. Hence, in the Bible the lines of image and dominion are the lines of the priesthood and the kingship. These two lines run from the beginning of the Bible to the end of the Bible. When the Bible speaks of God creating man, it speaks of image and dominion. In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John says that the Lord has released us from our sins by His blood so that we might be priests (1:5-6), that the Lord made us priests and a kingdom to reign on the earth (5:10), and that when we are resurrected and enter into glory, we will be priests who will reign with the Lord (20:6). Finally, when the New Jerusalem is manifested, the holy city is like jasper (21:11, 18). Jasper denotes the image of God, because God is like jasper in appearance (4:3). In the holy city the water of life&mdash;the Spirit of life&mdash;flows to fill the city with God; hence, the image of God is fully expressed. Furthermore, those who are a part of the New Jerusalem will reign as kings and exercise God&rsquo;s authority for eternity (22:5).</p>
<p>The two lines of the priesthood and the kingship run through the Bible. The priesthood enables man to express God, and the kingship enables man to represent God. The priesthood causes man to have the image of God, and the kingship causes man to have the dominion of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATION AND RECOVERY<br />
OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>God created man with the intention that man would be a priest, that is, a person who draws near to God, allows God to flow through him, is saturated with God, and expresses the glory of God. God also intended that man would exercise His authority. The enemy knew that if the water of life could not flow through man, man would not be like God and could not exercise God&rsquo;s authority. Hence, the enemy came in to damage man so that man would not draw near to God, contact God, or let God flow through him. This is when the adamic race failed God and fell.</p>
<p>God, however, did not give up His original intention. He continued to work by gaining the fathers such as Abel, Enoch, and Noah. Later, He chose Abraham from the fallen human race so that his descendants would become a new race, the children of Israel. After the children of Israel came out of Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, God said to them, &ldquo;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought you to Myself...And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&rdquo; (Exo. 19:4, 6). God intended that the Israelites would become His priests, not individually but corporately as a kingdom.</p>
<p>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart was for every Israelite to be a priest who drew near to God, allowed God to pass through him, and was saturated with God. Moses is an example. As the representative of the children of Israel, he had the image of God to express God, and he also had the dominion of God to represent God. God&rsquo;s intention was that every Israelite would be like Moses, having God&rsquo;s image and dominion.</p>
<p>As soon as God unveiled His heart&rsquo;s desire, the children of Israel fell and were corrupted. While Moses was fulfilling his priesthood by drawing near to God, the children of Israel were tempted at the foot of Mount Sinai. They did not know how to touch God, draw near to God, or be in His presence; they only knew how to serve a visible god with their physical eyes. As a result, they built a golden calf to worship, thus corrupting themselves. When Moses came down from the mountain and saw the situation, he was furious, and said, &ldquo;Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me&rdquo; (32:26). This was a call for those who were on God&rsquo;s side to stand with Moses. Of the twelve tribes, only the tribe of Levi stood on God&rsquo;s side. Then Moses told the Levites to take out their swords and slay the idol worshippers. The Levites did not care for human relationships; they slew even their own kinsmen. Because the Levites sanctified themselves and remained loyal to God, the priesthood was transferred from the Israelites to the tribe of Levi (vv. 26-29; Num. 1:53). At this time, the Levites became the priests of God. Only the Levites could draw near to God and enter into His presence. They could fellowship with God, allow God to flow through them, and be mingled with Him.</p>
<p>However, history repeated itself, and the priests of the tribe of Levi fell into a desolate state. In the book of Judges a certain Levite was hired by Micah to serve an idol for ten pieces of silver, an array of clothing, and his food, thus undermining the status of a priest and defiling the ministry of the priesthood (17:7-13). Later, at the time of Eli the priesthood was completely corrupted (1 Sam. 2:12-25). The children of Israel became so desolate that the Ark was captured (4:5-11).</p>
<p>It was not until God first raised up David through Samuel and then Solomon that the children of Israel were revived and the priests were revived and strengthened. David divided the priests into twenty-four divisions to minister before God (1 Chron. 24). However, this good situation did not last long. The children of Israel fell into desolation, the priests were not up to standard, the temple was shut, and the altar was abandoned (2 Kings 12:5-8; 2 Chron. 28:24-25; 29:6-8). This was a pitiful situation.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus is a priest; He is even the High Priest. When He was on the earth, He always brought men to God. He was a person who had entered into God and who allowed God to flow through Him (John 14:9-11). When the Lord was on the earth, the water of life was flowing through Him, and He allowed the Spirit of God to flow through Him. There was no obstacle between Him and God. After He went to the cross and offered Himself to God, He was raised from the dead and ascended to the presence of God to become our glorious High Priest (Heb. 4:14; 7:26).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is our Priest, and those who receive Him are also priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). His priestly life has entered into us; hence, we can draw near to God, fellowship with God, and allow God to flow through us. As believers, we can touch the source of the water of life, and we can allow the water of life to flow into us and to flow out of us as rivers of living water. We can be priests who draw near to God.</p>
<p>According to church history, after the time of the apostles the church became desolate, just as the children of Israel in the Old Testament became desolate, and the priesthood was lost. In Christianity only a few believers function as priests. But even these few believers do not know how to pray and touch the throne of God, nor do they know how to allow the water of life to flow through them. The situation in Christianity is very much like the desolate state recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles: the temple was closed, the altar was abandoned, and the priests were improper.</p>
<p>In order to recover the building of His church, God must first recover the priesthood. The priesthood upholds the building of the church; without the priesthood, it is impossible to build up the church. Hence, God is sounding out a call for us to fulfill the priesthood, just as He called the Levites at the foot of Mount Sinai. Who is willing to stand on God&rsquo;s side in order to fellowship with God and allow God to flow through him by rising up to be a priest of God?</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
