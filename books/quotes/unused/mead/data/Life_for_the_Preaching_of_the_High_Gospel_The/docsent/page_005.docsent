   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By incarnation God brought Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then by resurrection God brought man into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now there is a man in the heavens who is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is a man altogether one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be saved is to receive this man into you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now that you are saved, you are a real VIP.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are truly a very important person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My burden in this chapter is to uplift you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to see how high you are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to see that you are a person on such a high level.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the ancient times, people spoke with pride of their belonging to a royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But do you know that today we belong to a family which is even higher than any so-called royal family?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We belong to the divine family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are such wonderful persons, the VIPs on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus is not only our Savior but also a divine man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the very God incarnated to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we have Jesus in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is mingled and blended with us, and we are a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This makes us VIPs in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If all the human beings were taken away from this earth, I believe that even God Himself would feel pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But praise the Lord, there are human beings on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet these human beings have become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Look at the situation of today's world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the Christians, without those of us who realize that we are VIPs, what would the situation of the world be today?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there are many VIPs in a city, that city will have a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we began to meet at the Elden meeting hall in Los Angeles, that area was really dark, morally speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But since the church began to meet there, that area has become greatly improved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the church would have a great increase in number, just consider what kind of situation that would create.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we need to go and disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have a deep burden that some day in Los Angeles and in many other big cities, there will be Christian meetings that are not according to the old religion but according to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There will be meetings in many places without any religious forms.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I look to the Lord that some day He will work this out for gaining people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is going to carry this out through the young generation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This cannot be worked out through old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is through with old religion with its religious forms and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord is going to do something new.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The age has been turned from religion to Christ, from doctrines to the Spirit, from the forms and rituals to the new and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The young people are a greatly blessed generation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord is going to do something new with the young generation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Forget about your background.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Forget about what you obtained, what you saw, and what you received from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to realize that today is the day for the Lord to fulfill His purpose in a marvelous way, a way which has never been seen or heard before.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord bless all of us.</S>
