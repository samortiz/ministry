   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DWELLING TOGETHER ACCORDING TO KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 7 Peter says that the husbands should dwell together with their wives according to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The phrase according to knowledge can easily be misinterpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Men who have more knowledge or education than their wives may fail to respect their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Peter is not referring to the knowledge of human education.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For a husband to dwell together with his wife according to knowledge is to live with her in an intelligent and reasonable way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is to be governed by spiritual knowledge that recognizes the nature of the marriage relationship and the weakness of the female, not governed by any passion or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Husbands, your relationship with your wife should be governed by spiritual knowledge; it should not be governed by the knowledge you have gained through your college education.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Spiritual knowledge recognizes the nature of the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In married life, husbands need to have a spiritual knowledge that recognizes the weakness of the female.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have this knowledge, we shall know that God created woman the weaker vessel simply for the nature of the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is to be a proper marriage relationship, both parties should not be equally strong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One party should be stronger than the other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the brothers should not think that the weakness of their wives is something to be despised.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, we must realize that our wives weakness was created by God specifically for the purpose of the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we need to understand the reason for the weakness of the female, and we need to understand the nature of the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to have our married life governed not by the knowledge from human education but by spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A husband s relationship with his wife is certainly not to be governed by any passion or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that in married life a husband should be governed neither by worldly knowledge nor by fleshly emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, he must be governed by spiritual knowledge that recognizes that the weakness of the female was designed by God to fit in with the nature of the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ASSIGNING HONOR</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 7 Peter also says that the husbands should assign honor to their wives as to the weaker, female vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word rendered assigning, aponemo, means to apportion, to portion out; hence, to assign to.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Greek word for honor is time and means preciousness, valuable worth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The husbands should appreciate the preciousness, the valuable worth, of the wives, and apportion it, assign it, as honor to them duly and reasonably as to the weaker, female vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man, including woman, was made a vessel to contain God Rom 9:21, 23 , and believers in Christ are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The female, according to nature in God s creation, is weaker than the male physically and psychologically.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the wives, as female vessels, are weaker, they are still vessels of the Lord and can be vessels unto honor 2 Tim 2:21 , deserving a certain honor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter tells the husbands to assign honor to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A husband must give at least a certain measure of honor to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we see that a husband should honor his wife, we should realize that this implies some kind of submission to her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Submission always goes with honor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do not submit to a particular person, how can you honor that one?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Honoring someone always implies a certain degree of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we have already pointed out, this is a word of balance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Husbands must honor their wives, and, no doubt, the wives must also honor their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A husband should not argue that because his wife is the weaker vessel, she should not be honored by him, the stronger vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once again I would say that husbands need to recognize that the weakness of their wives was prepared by God for their marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though the wife is the weaker vessel, in many aspects she is worthy of her husband s honor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the husband must assign honor to her.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Married life can be compared to a corporation, a business, that assigns a percentage of the yearly profits to its shareholders or owners.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In our married life husbands must learn what percentage of the profit of the marriage corporation should go to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The husband needs to know how much of the profit belongs to him and how much should be assigned to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Husbands should not rob wives of their profit, of their honor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In married life a portion of the profit or honor must be assigned to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The husband s assigning of honor to the wife should be according to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The phrase according to knowledge is related to assigning honor as to the weaker, female vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, according to knowledge is also related to the matter of dwelling together with our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our dwelling with our wives should be according to knowledge and also accompanied by the assigning of honor to our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way to have a proper balance in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our married life lacks this balance, it will be like a scale with one side in the air and the other side down low.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That kind of imbalance causes a very poor married life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The point here is that the balance in married life comes mainly from the husband assigning honor to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Often a husband will rob his wife of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He does not assign any portion of the honor, any part of the profits of the marriage corporation, to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This practice is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result of my study of Peter s writings, I have come to appreciate them very much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I especially appreciate the particular terms used by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One of these terms is assigning honor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers, have you ever realized that you are required to assign a certain amount of honor to your wives?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Your wife may be weaker than you are and not as highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nevertheless, she is worthy of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The corporation of your married life has earned a large profit, and she deserves a share in it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the husband, you need to know what portion of the honor, of the profit, should be assigned to her.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In assigning honor to the wife, the husband should be careful not to assign too much honor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I believe that Peter s word about assigning honor implies that a husband should not give too much honor to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If he honors her too much, he will spoil her.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The husband should assign honor to his wife properly, giving her neither too little nor too much.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have seen marriages where the husband was so kind, good, generous, and humble that he assigned all the profit of the marriage corporation to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That caused the wife to be spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers, assigning honor to our wives should not be done foolishly, blindly, or ignorantly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It must be done according to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As husbands, we need to determine what is the right percentage of honor that should go to ourselves as the husbands and what percentage to our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you assign honor to your wife in a proper way, the business of your married life will be healthy and sound.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Your marriage will be secure and peaceful.</S>
