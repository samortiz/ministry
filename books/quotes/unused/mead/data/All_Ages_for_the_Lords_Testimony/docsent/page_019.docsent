   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO GROUPING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The healing of diseases or injuries in our physical bodies takes place mainly through nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose a certain part of your body is hurt or diseased.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not possible to feed only this part of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the contrary, you feed your whole body, and this part of the body will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not think that the Body will receive some benefit if you select a few strong members of the Body and bring them together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No, the stronger ones and the weaker ones need to be blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God does not put all the weak ones into one group and all the strong ones into another group; instead, He tempers them by blending them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is wrong for the strong ones to group together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the strong ones group together, the result will be division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to verses 24 and 25, God tempers the Body together so that there will be no division in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the shoulders were to come together, there would be a division in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although you may have no intention of damaging the Body, you will frustrate the growth of the Body if you group yourselves together as stronger ones or more spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 26 says, "If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A suffering member of the Body should not be left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, the Body with all the members must bear the suffering along with this member.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body of Christ is not built up with only spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, the Body is built up with all the different members the comely ones, the less honorable ones, and the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not mean, however, that all the different members are arranged in distinct groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No, all are blended together so that the Body may be tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are tempered, the uncomely ones share comeliness with the comely ones, and the weaker ones are nourished and supported by the stronger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CARING FOR THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never regard ourselves as spiritual or boast of what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those sisters in Chefoo who claimed to be today's Madame Guyons were actually not that spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, the co-workers in Shanghai who claimed to have seen the Body actually did not see very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often our estimate of ourselves is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of this, we should not classify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever we may be, we need to have fellowship with the saints and shepherd them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do your best to take up the burden of caring for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By caring for others, you will be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As you contact the weak ones, you will discover not only where they are, but also where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before contacting them, you may think that you are all right, that you know Christ and the church, and that you are wholly for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But through your contact with the weaker ones, you may discover that you have no food to feed them, no medicine to heal them, and no clothing to cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, you will be exposed and realize that so much of what you have is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ADMONISHING THE DISORDERLY ONES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Thessalonians 5:14 says, "We entreat you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be longsuffering toward all."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse describes the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church life the disorderly ones are necessary to prove our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we need to praise the Lord for the disorderly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are told to admonish those who are disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you admonish them too severely, they may be stirred up to fight with you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Admonishing the disorderly ones requires a great deal of prayer, experience, and exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever I have had to admonish the disorderly ones, I have had the sense that I was walking on thin ice over a deep river.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not a simple matter to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we pay no attention to the disorderly ones among us, God will send in even more of them to show us that we cannot ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to 1 Thessalonians 5:14, we must admonish them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The disorderly ones surely expose where we are.</S>
