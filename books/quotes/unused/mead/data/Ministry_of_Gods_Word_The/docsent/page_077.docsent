   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADVANCING ALL THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is harder for us to speak today than for those who spoke one hundred years ago, and harder still than for those who spoke four or five hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is harder for us to speak than it was for Martin Luther, because the release of God s word is always advancing onward and upward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we speak God s word, the more profound it becomes and the higher it gets.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today God s speaking has reached the present stage, and we cannot go back to His former speaking again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said, My Father is working until now, and I also am working John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God never stops working.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He worked yesterday, and He is working today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His work today is more advanced than His work yesterday, and His work tomorrow will be more advanced than His work today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His work never diminishes; it only increases.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His work is forever advancing and never retreating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Martin Luther saw the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But what men have seen in the last one hundred years concerning justification by faith is much more than what Luther saw.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not arrogance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that God s word is advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The best book Luther wrote was his commentary on Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But believers today have seen much more from Galatians than what Luther saw.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s word has moved on, and it is impossible for anyone to turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must realize that all the truths are in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basis of all our speaking is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet the discovery of biblical truth, the release of God s word, and the things that the church receives from God are advancing day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every generation of God s children sees more than the generation before.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, in the first few centuries, the church interpreted the kingdom to mean heaven, but in the last century, this matter has become very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom is the kingdom, and heaven is heaven; these are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we are even clearer: The kingdom is not only a matter of reward but also a matter of spiritual reign and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We believe all the biblical truths were clear during the apostolic age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later they were buried and then recovered little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consider the example of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our understanding of it has moved on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For years men spoke about resurrection in a limited way; they understood it only to mean to a certain sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But today some have seen what resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have surpassed their predecessors in what they have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God is merciful to the church, the word will abound more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God speaks, His word always climbs higher and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s word is always advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is always ready to give more to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In reading the best homiletics of the second and third centuries and in comparing them with the present ministry of the word, we can see how much progress has been made.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit has not held Himself back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word is still advancing; it is not retreating.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the church outwardly faces many obstacles, our God is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not stop after He has accomplished one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is still working, and He is still advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the ministry of the word today should touch more than what was touched by former ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should realize before the Lord that grace is pouring out in unbounded measure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order for the church to grow to full stature and to touch the fullness of Christ, we believe that the riches of the ministry must increase.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not speak with contentment and nonchalance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God wants us to touch something high.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He wants to give us the high things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps God has not chosen us to be a pivotal minister, one who is a joint, but I hope that we can still have a share among the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although we cannot build up the framework itself, we can at least fill in the gaps in the existing framework.</S>
