[1]  CONTENTS The Importance of Breaking Before and after the Breaking Things in the Hands How to Know Men The Church and the Work of God Breaking and Discipline Separation and Revelation Impression and the Condition of the Spirit Pliableness after the Breaking PREFACE
[2]  This book discusses a fundamental lesson facing a servant of Christ the breaking of the outer man by the Lord for the release of the spirit.
[3]  The only work God approves is that of the spirit, and the breaking of the outer man is the only way that the spirit can have full freedom.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE THE IMPORTANCE OF BREAKING Scripture Reading: John 12:24; Heb 4:12-13; 1 Cor 2:11-14; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 1:9; 7:6; 8:4-8; Gal 5:16, 22-23, 25
[5]  Sooner or later a servant of God discovers that he himself is the greatest frustration to his work.
[6]  Sooner or later he finds that his outer man does not match his inner man.
[7]  He discovers that the greatest hindrance to his work is his outer man and that this outer man frustrates him from exercising his spirit.
[8]  Every servant of God should be able to exercise his spirit, to secure God's presence in his spirit, to know God's word through his spirit, to touch men's condition by his spirit, to convey God's word through his spirit, and to sense and receive divine revelation with his spirit.
[9]  God resides in the inner man, and the man outside this God-occupied inner man is the outer man.
[10]  Whether or not our work will be effective depends on whether the Lord has broken down our outer man and whether the inner man can be released through our broken, outer man.
[11]  In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
[12]  Many people can testify that this work has never stopped in them.
[13]  The Holy Spirit has only one goal in all of His disciplining work: To break and dismantle the outer man so that the inner man can break forth.
[14]  But the trouble with us is that we murmur as soon as we suffer a little hardship, and we complain as soon as we suffer a little defeat.
[15]  The Lord breaks our outer man in two ways.
[16]  The breaking of the outer man is a basic experience which every servant of the Lord must go through.
[17]  The outer man is working, but the inner man does not join in. The outer man and the inner man do not match; they are not in unison.
[18]  If the outer man is broken, the spirit spontaneously will remain in the Lord all the time.
[19]  If God grants us mercy and breaks our outer man, we will manifest the following traits: Our old curiosity will be dead; we will no longer be curious.
[20]  Formerly, we were very strong in our emotion; we were easily stirred up in the tender sentiment of love or in the raw sentiment of anger whenever something happened.
[21]  But if God is merciful to us, He will break our outer man, and our inner man will no longer be touched when many things happen to us.
[22]  We usually feel God's presence only when we come to Him.
[23]  Whatever we do, even when we exercise the utmost care, we feel that we have turned away from God a little.
[24]  If we know the breaking of the outer man, we can enjoy God's continual presence without interruption from the outer man, whether we are rebuking a brother severely or praying in the presence of God.
[25]  I admit that rebuking a brother is a difficult thing to do, but if our outer man is broken, we can rebuke a brother without the need of turning back to God because God's presence will be with us all the time.
[26]  When the outer man is broken, all outward activities are confined to the outward realm while the inner man continues to enjoy God's presence.
[27]  Strictly speaking, the outward things can only affect the outer man; but the outer man, in turn, affects the inner man.
[28]  If God is merciful to us and if our outer man is broken, it will be separated from our inner man, and outward things will only affect the outer man; they will not affect the inner man.
[29]  A man can converse with others with his outer man while his inner man is still fellowshipping with God.
[30]  If God is merciful to us and we have such an experience of separation, we will conduct business and move around in our outer man, but our inner man will be unmoved.
[31]  As soon as our outer man is bound, our spirit becomes bound as well.
[32]  Nor does God allow our spirit to bypass our outer man when it operates in others.
[33]  The Holy Spirit never works on man apart from man, and our spirit can never work on man apart from our outer man.
[34]  Suppose a brother is preparing to speak God's word.
[35]  He may have the word and a burden in his spirit, and the burden may be very heavy.
[36]  The trouble today is that while our inner man is available to receive a burden from God, the mind in our outer man is too busy and confused.
[37]  If the Lord grants us the grace and breaks our outer man, we will become a person adept at exercising our spirit, and we will be able to release it whenever we want to.
[38]  We do not become qualified for God's work simply by learning some doctrines.
[39]  It is crucial for a worker of the Lord to be able to know men.
[40]  When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition.
[41]  If the Spirit of God shows our spirit the condition of those who come to us, we will be able to give them a suitable word.
[42]  When a worker contacts a man, the first and most basic thing for him to do is to learn what this person's real need is before God.
[43]  We can say that a man has a frivolous spirit or a downtrodden spirit, etc. What is the source of all of these spiritual conditions? For example, when we say that the spirit is stubborn, where does this stubbornness come from? When we say that the spirit is proud, where does this pride come from? When we say that the spirit is wild, where does this wildness come from? A normal spirit has no characteristic of its own.
[44]  We speak of a stubborn spirit, a proud spirit, a haughty spirit, an unforgiving spirit, a jealous spirit, etc., because the outer man has not been separated from the inner man.
[45]  When we say that a spirit is stubborn, we mean that the inner man of that person has assumed the characteristics of the stubborn outer man.
[46]  What must we do before we can know the condition of man's spirit?
[47]  When we find that we can touch a brother with our spirit, it does not mean that we can touch every brother with our spirit, nor does it mean that we can touch every spiritual aspect of a brother with our spirit.
[48]  After we are dealt with by the Lord and have learned our basic lessons, our spirit will be released, and we will be able to use our spirit to touch other brothers, and we will know their condition.
[49]  CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH AND THE WORK OF GOD
[50]  If we truly know the meaning of God's work, we will have to acknowledge that the outer man is indeed a great hindrance.
[51]  After the outer man is broken, how does a man approach God's Word, how does he serve as a minister of His word, and how does he preach the gospel?
[52]  It is important in our study of the Word to have our thoughts enter into the thoughts of the writers of the Bible and to have our thoughts enter into the thoughts of the Holy Spirit.
[53]  If our outer man is broken and our spirit is released, our thoughts will not only become one with the thoughts of the Bible, but our whole being will touch the very Spirit that is behind the writing of the Bible.
[54]  On the one hand, God wants us to understand His Word this is the beginning of His work.
[55]  Many people have the wrong concept that a man believes in the gospel because he has heard the right teachings, or because he is touched in his emotion.
[56]  During these years God has been taking the way of recovery.
[57]  God does not want to see a saved person wait for many years before he deals with his sins.
[58]  In order for our outer man to be broken, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.
[59]  The work of the Holy Spirit in us has a positive aspect and a negative aspect to it.
[60]  After we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit lives in us, yet our outer man limits His freedom.
[61]  This is the reason that God has been dealing with our outer man and breaking it from the day we were saved.
[62]  God does not deal with our outer man according to our perceived need but according to our need as He sees it.
[63]  The Holy Spirit does not deal with our outer man by strengthening our inner man.
[64]  From the day a person is saved, God has been edifying him through the impartation of grace.
[65]  A man can receive grace from God through many ways.
[66]  If we realize that all of God's arrangements are for our highest good, including those things that bring us embarrassment, and if we are willing to give ourselves to God in this way, we will find the Holy Spirit dealing with us in many things.
[67]  When the Lord finishes such a work in us, we will not only receive grace and be strong in our inner being, but the outer man which was once a hindrance and frustration to the Lord's word, purpose, and presence will now be broken.
[68]  God not only wants to break our outer man, but also to separate it from the inner man.
[69]  He wants to dismantle our outer man so that our outer man does not become an encumbrance to the inner man.
[70]  He wants our spirit and our soul, that is, our inner man and our outer man, to be separated from each other.
[71]  The outer man needs to be broken before the spirit can be released.
[72]  If a man has never been enlightened by God or judged by Him in a deep way, thereby gaining a knowledge of his outer man, the release of his spirit naturally will be accompanied by his outer man.
[73]  If our outer man is not condemned, what will be exposed as soon as we come in contact with others will be the most conspicuous element of the outer man.
[74]  Hebrews 4:12-13 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[75]  Some may say, "I do not feel that God's word can do anything.
[76]  I have been listening to God's word for a long time, and I have accepted His revelation.
[77]  Today we have heard that the outer man is a serious problem and that the fleshly man must be broken.
[78]  If we speak about this subject lightly as if it is a subject for conversation, it will do us no good.
[79]  If we receive God's mercy to see the light, we will say, "Lord!
[80]  When God's light shines on us, we will see what the outer man is, and we will fall down and not be able to rise again.
[81]  We say that we love the Lord, but when God's light shines on us, we will see that we did not love the Lord at all but instead only loved ourselves.
[82]  If we try to discern doctrinally what is of the self, what is of the Lord, what is of the flesh, what is of the Holy Spirit, what is of the Lord's grace, what is of the outer man, and what is of the inner man, we can spell out a long list and can even memorize the list, but we will still be in darkness.
[83]  Hebrews 4:13 continues, saying, "And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account."
[84]  Here the Lord shows us the standard by which He enlightens us and discerns our thoughts and intentions.
[85]  If God is merciful to us and grants us a little revelation, if we see a little of ourselves as God sees us, and if He reveals to us a little of what we are like, we will immediately fall on our face before the Lord.
[86]  The self that was previously hidden now will be exposed.
[87]  The self that was removed from our consciousness now will be clearly felt.
[88]  What we have seen under the light will be rejected by us again when things, words, or intentions of a similar nature arise a second time; we immediately will see that what we are faced with is the same thing that we were trying to deal with the first time.
[89]  It shows us how much of what we thought was good is actually not good, how much of what we thought was right is actually wrong, how much of what we thought was spiritual is actually soulish, and how much of what we thought was of God is actually of ourselves.
[90]  Whether or not we can be a worker of the Lord depends not on what we say or do but on what comes out of us.
[91]  If we say and do one thing, yet what comes out of us is another thing, others will not receive help.
[92]  Brothers, God requires that our spirit be released, and the church also requires that our spirit be released.
[93]  We have a very great and crucial need: Our outer man must be broken.
[94]  If the outer man is not broken, our spirit will not be released, and the impression we give to others will not be an impression of the spirit.
[95]  The Spirit deals with our outer man by these two means: discipline and shining.
[96]  When God shines on us, it is a time for believing and prostrating ourselves, not the time for petitioning.
[97]  Many brothers and sisters busy themselves in prayer when God is speaking to them.
[98]  We have these two main things before us the Spirit's discipline and God's shining, or we can say the Spirit's revelation.
[99]  CHAPTER NINE PLIABLENESS AFTER THE BREAKING PLIABLENESS AND THE BREAKING OF THE WILL
[100]  God uses many ways to break our outer man, and these ways vary from person to person.
[101]  Therefore, everyone who is subdued, either by revelation or by discipline, shows one characteristic pliableness.
[102]  Once a man is broken by the Holy Spirit, he will manifest a pliableness that comes from a fear of God.
[103]  The greatest help that we can receive does not come simply from the correction of our mistakes.
[104]  The greatest help comes as our outer man is broken and our spirit becomes open and free.
[105]  If our outer man is not broken, it will be hard for us to receive any help from anyone.
[106]  Fellowship is not a communication of the mind with the mind or an exchange of opinions; it is the contact of spirit with spirit.
[107]  When our spirit touches another brother's spirit, that contact of the spirit is fellowship.
[108]  It is only as we receive mercy from the Lord to break the outer shell and to tear down the outer man that our spirit is released.
[109]  If our outer man is broken and our inner man released, we will touch the spirit of the church, and we will be more useful to the Lord.
[110]  First, we must know that the breaking of the outer man is a work of the Holy Spirit.
[111]  But if we know that an activity is of the flesh, should we try to stop it ourselves, or should we wait for the Holy Spirit to break it?
[112]  We should point out two things in reference to this question.
[113]  First, everything natural is independent; it does not need to be joined to the spirit.
[114]  Anything that comes from the discipline of the Holy Spirit is controlled by the spirit.
