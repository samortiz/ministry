<p>After leaving Japan, we went directly to America, and stopped briefly in Honolulu. When we arrived on the West Coast, we visited San Francisco. Most of the meetings in America that are similar to ours do not have a large congregation. The largest group, which is in New York City, has about eighty or ninety saints. The second largest group is probably in San Francisco. There may have been two other groups of about the same size&mdash;one in the south, and the other in the north. These groups have thirty to forty believers. The group in the north and the group in the south consist of mostly Caucasian saints, and the group in San Francisco has only Chinese saints who are mainly from Taiwan, particularly from Taipei. The core of the group in San Francisco is mainly made up of students who study at the University of California. There is much work to be done there. They need workers who can work with the Chinese-speaking people and then spread the work.</p>
<p>After San Francisco we went to Los Angeles. The meeting in Los Angeles is probably larger than the one in San Francisco. When they first began to meet, two Chinese brothers took care of the meeting. Now a brother from London labors there. There are only a few Chinese brothers and sisters in this group; most of the saints are Caucasian. Afterward, we went to the southwest corner of America.</p>
<p>We then visited the Northwest and learned that there is a group of Chinese brothers who meet on a university campus. An American brother is taking the lead in that group, and they have a few American students. This group is doing well, but they do not have a formal meeting.</p>
<p>From there we visited several places, including Chicago and Detroit. We also went to Pittsburgh and met two families there. One family came from Hong Kong, and the other, from Shanghai. These two families meet together every Lord&rsquo;s Day and listen to a message that was given either in Hong Kong or New York City. We spent a short time with them. Their condition is good, and they are learning to live before the Lord.</p>
<p>The meeting in New York City has a history of at least twenty-five years. However, their meetings are not stable and even stopped for a period of time. About half the saints who meet regularly are Chinese, and the other half are Caucasian. During the period when their meetings stopped, the Chinese saints continued to meet because they had a Chinese-speaking meeting. Before our visit, the Chinese and Caucasian saints met together only to pray and listen to a message. They did not break bread together. After our visit they began to have the Lord&rsquo;s table together. Now their meetings are lively and strong. However, there are only eighty to ninety saints meeting in a city as large as New York.</p>
<p>A large portion of our trip was spent in America, specifically in New York City. We stayed there for a longer time because I had some personal things to take care of, and my wife needed medical attention. We also visited the capital of America, Washington, D.C., where there is a small meeting that is stable. One brother in this meeting is originally from Shanghai; he and his wife migrated to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>During this visit my view concerning the situation in America changed. In the past I considered Americans to be materialistic because they pay too much attention to material things and worldly enjoyment but are indifferent to religious things. However, the few people whom I contacted gave me a different impression. According to my observation there is much work to do in America, and our work would be effective.</p>
<p>Compared to Japan, which is a Buddhist country, America is a genuine Christian country. Before the Korean War less than half of the American population attended Sunday service. In other words, out of every one hundred Christians less than fifty regularly attended a Sunday service. However, because the Americans suffered many casualties in the Korean War, they were stirred up to attend Sunday service in search of consolation and peace. Since that time onward, the number of Americans who attend Sunday service has increased to more than sixty percent of the population.</p>
<p>Most of the Christian groups in America preach an orthodox gospel. There is an increasing number of modernists, but there are still more orthodox groups. Over the past ten years, especially after the truce in Korea, several evangelists have emerged from the Assembly of God. Because they work in a way that is according to the common sentiment of the American people, some of them have congregations of over ten thousand people. While I was in New York City, a group called Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses held a gathering, and about thirteen to fifteen thousand people attended. This group has increased because their work fits in with the way of the Americans.</p>
<p>Even though people are being saved, on the spiritual side there is a lack of spiritual depth among Christian groups in America. There is a group in New York City that was started by A. B. Simpson, who founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance. That group teaches the believers&rsquo; co-crucifixion with Christ. Mrs. Penn-Lewis also taught this. Many believers regard this teaching to be the deepest among Christians in America. The messages that we gave in New York focused on how God came in the Son to be man&rsquo;s life. After more than ten meetings an older sister, who labored in China and met with us, came to me and said that no one in America speaks about taking Christ as life. This comment shows the situation in America. The orthodox gospel is preached in America, but there is not much depth.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find a group of believers who teach the orthodox truth and also have spiritual depth. We have to admit that there is a need for the Lord&rsquo;s work in America. Hence, America is also a large field for the work.</p>
<p>Our impression of America is that as long as what we have is genuine and good, the Americans will receive it, and the result will be rich and solid. The brothers in San Francisco and the church in New York City want us to help them. It would be good if some of the saints or some workers would be burdened to migrate there to meet this need. Some of the saints may be concerned about the language, but this is not a great problem. The saints who go can focus their labor among the Chinese people, and after three to five years the language issue will be resolved.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
