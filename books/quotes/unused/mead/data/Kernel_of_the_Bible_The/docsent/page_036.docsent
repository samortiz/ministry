   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE FOUNDATION STONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND AS THE CORNERSTONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to experience all these aspects of Christ as the stone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we experience Him in these aspects, we shall have a complete building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This building is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that Christ is the foundation stone is not a doctrine; it is something that we must experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apart from the church life, you cannot experience Christ as the foundation stone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, outside the church life, it is impossible to experience Christ as the cornerstone, much less as the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the early days of the church life in Germany, you brothers probably did not have very much experience of Christ as the foundation stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after the stormy winds began to blow and attacks began to come upon the church, you realized that you cannot afford to be the church without a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You had to experience Christ in such a way that you could withstand the storm and the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the experience of Christ as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord that in Stuttgart the foundation has been laid!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gradually, after the laying of the foundation, you began to experience Christ as the cornerstone, as the One who joins the building together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not enough for the walls to be solid; they must also be connected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are joined by your experience of Christ as the connecting element, that is, as the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is much more than a doctrine; it is a very real experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE TOPSTONE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although you may have Christ as the foundation stone and the cornerstone, you will eventually realize that you are still in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What will protect you from the rain?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need not only a solid foundation and a strong cornerstone, but also the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not a simple matter for Christ to be the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Zechariah 3:9 reveals that the topstone has been engraved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This engraving indicates some kind of dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On neither the foundation stone nor on the cornerstone was there any engraving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The engraving on the topstone makes it beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The beauty of the building is mainly with the topstone, and this beauty comes from the engraving, the cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This matter is deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In relation to the building of the first temple, there was no mention of the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only at the time of the rebuilding of the temple does the Bible speak of the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In fact, no other stone is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the rebuilt temple was small in size, its beauty surpassed that of the previous temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the eyes of God, the rebuilt temple was beautiful and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church that was built on the day of Pentecost was rather large, but its topstone was not that beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later the church was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, at the end of this age, the Lord is rebuilding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although it is smaller in size than it was on the day of Pentecost, it has the topstone full of engraving.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This engraving is the beauty of today's recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The saints in the church in Stuttgart should be encouraged, for the church in their locality has a certain amount of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A SPIRITUAL DREAM</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that many of you will have a spiritual dream concerning God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In your dream may you see the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone with its beautiful engraving.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, in the rebuilt church, we have the topstone with its engraving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I speak of having a spiritual dream, I am not talking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the book of Genesis, Joseph had two such dreams Gen 37:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the first dream, the other sheaves bowed down to his sheaf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the second, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars made obeisance to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Joseph had these dreams long before he began to reign in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Likewise, before we can have the genuine church life, we need to have some dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Day and night may you dream of the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, your dreams will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE NEED FOR A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Up to this point, we have seen a bird's-eye view of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In principle, we should come to know the Bible in the same way as we acquaint ourselves with a city.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should first see a general sketch and then become familiar with the main streets.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If, instead of seeing a general sketch of the city, you begin by learning all the small streets, lanes, and alleys, you will get lost and never come to know the city as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, if you try to know the Bible by firstly studying it verse by verse, you will get lost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You will not even be able to find your way through the first chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, Genesis 1:2 speaks about darkness being upon the face of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may wonder what the darkness is and then what the deep is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In your attempt to find out, you may consult a concordance and, after that, a Bible dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you go through the Bible this way, it will take a long time to complete even the first several verses of the first chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you take this way, you will never come to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The way to know the Bible is to first have a bird's-eye view and see the kernel of the Bible, which is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the first three chapters of Genesis, we have Christ, and in the remaining forty-seven chapters, we see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Exodus we have the tabernacle; in 1 Kings, the temple; and in Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah, the rebuilt temple.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a bird's-eye view of the Old Testament.</S>
