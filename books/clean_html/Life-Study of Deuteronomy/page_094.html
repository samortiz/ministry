<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>U. Concerning a Man Taking a New Wife</H2><P>In 24:5 we have a word concerning a man taking a new wife. When a man took a new wife, he was not to go out with the army, nor was he to be charged with any duty. He was to be free at home for one year, and he was to make his wife happy. The concern shown here is very human.</P><P>God likes to see a male and a female come together in marriage for reproduction. Marriage is for human existence and human reproduction. Therefore, we must honor marriage and not damage it. God encourages us to get married, and any way in which we might damage marriage is hateful to Him.</P><P>God is happy to see the young people coming together in marriage, and He is even more happy to see them reproduce. Immediately after God created man, He charged man to be "fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" (Gen. 1:28), that is, to fill the earth with human beings. This indicates that we need to be married properly according to God's purpose and for God's purpose. God's purpose in marriage is to use us to maintain the existence of mankind on earth. Even today, at the end of the age, God still needs more people. Some married couples do not want to have children because they do not want to be bothered. It is not according to God's way for a married couple not to have children. God's way is that human beings get married and then reproduce.</P><P>God also wants us to be reproductive in the church life through the preaching of the gospel that sinners might be saved and regenerated. If we are spiritually barren, this is a shame in the sight of God. God hates barrenness and fruitlessness. But He is happy to see us becoming spiritually productive and fruitful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>V. Concerning a Case of Leprosy</H2><P>Concerning a case of leprosy, the people were to carefully keep what the Levitical priests instructed them, as God commanded the priests (Deut. 24:8). The children of Israel were to remember what Jehovah their God did to Miriam on the way when they came out of Egypt (v. 9). (For details regarding the case of Miriam, please see the life-study on Numbers 12.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>W. Not Forgetting to Blot Out<br>the Memory of Amalek</H2><P>The children of Israel were to remember what Amalek did to them on the way when they came out of Egypt, striking all their worn-out ones who were at the rear, when they were faint and weary (Deut. 25:17-18). Amalek did not fear God and was the greatest enemy of God's people, frustrating them in taking God's way and attacking the younger and weaker ones and those who were worn-out and unable to go further on the journey. Therefore, when Jehovah their God gave the children of Israel rest from all their enemies and gave to them the God-promised land as an inheritance, they were to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven, and they were not to forget this (v. 19).</P><P>Amalek typifies our flesh. The thing that is most opposed to God's way is our flesh. Therefore, the flesh must be dealt with thoroughly. This is the spiritual significance of the requirement to blot out the memory of Amalek.</P>
