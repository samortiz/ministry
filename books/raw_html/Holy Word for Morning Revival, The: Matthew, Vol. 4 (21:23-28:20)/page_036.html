Now in chapter twenty-seven we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness. Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die. Nevertheless, actually He was rightly sentenced to death by the righteousness of God.</p><p>Pilate, the Roman governor, should have judged Christ according to righteousness. According to Roman law, the Sanhedrin acted illegally in arresting Christ. If Pilate had been just, he would have stopped the Sanhedrin from doing this. Because he was unrighteous and afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, he acted against Roman law. As a result, he released to the crowd Barabbas, the guilty one, but Jesus, he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.</p><p>Verses 27 through 32 show how the Lord Jesus was mocked by the heathen soldiers. He was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8. Following this, Matthew 27:33-44 reveals how the Lord was mocked by men and killed. They gave Him wine mingled with gall, a stupefying drink, but the Lord would not be stupefied. Rather, He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. Moreover, when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots. Thus, the Lord was robbed to the uttermost by sinners, fulfilling Psalm 22:18.</p><p>By the time of Matthew 27:45, unrighteous men had exhausted their deeds. They had done everything they could. At that time, God came in, in a righteous way to judge this crucified Savior and to forsake Him. The Lord Jesus suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God’s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin (Isa. 53:10). Darkness fell over all the land (Matt. 27:45) because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there, and because of our sin God forsook Him (v. 46).</p><p>The effect of the Lord’s crucifixion is revealed in verses 51 through 56. Hallelujah, His death tore the veil of the temple from top to bottom, shook the base of Satan’s rebellion, and broke the strongholds of Satan’s kingdom!</p><p>Afterwards, the Lord was buried in a new tomb by a rich man (vv. 57-66). In human honor of a high standard, the Lord rested on the Sabbath day (Luke 23:55-56), waiting for the time to rise from the dead.</p><p>After God had judged Christ in full, God’s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from the dead. Hence, in Matthew 28:1-20 the King’s victory is manifested: first, in His resurrection (vv. 1-15) and then in His reigning (vv. 16-20).</p><p>Because all authority was given to Him (v. 18), the heavenly King sent His disciples to disciple all the nations, charging them to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God, that is, to immerse them into all that the Triune God is.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
