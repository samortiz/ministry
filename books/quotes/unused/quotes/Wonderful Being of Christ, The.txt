What He is, is all-inclusive; it is difficult to explore and impossible to comprehend with our limited mind all that Christ is
We tried to find out from the sixty-six books of the Bible how many items there are concerning what the Lord Jesus is
Christ is the Head of the church, the life and content of the church, and even more, the foundation and testimony of the church
God Himself cannot be fathomed, His eternal power cannot be comprehended, and all His divine characteristics cannot be determined
Today we all know that the distance between the sun and the earth is just right; it is neither too far nor too near
There are innumerable planets and stars revolving in their respective orbits without colliding into one another
Five hundred years ago prior to Columbus's voyage, all people, whether in the east or in the west, considered the earth to be a flat square
There are innumerable stars that constitute a galaxy and incalculable galaxies that form the complete system of the universe
Christ, who is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of God's substance, upholds all things by the word of His power
According to the Greek, the word rendered divine characteristics in Romans 1:20 refers to the characteristics of God's nature
The universe expresses not only the eternal and infinite power of God but also some characteristics of God's nature
When you look up at the heavens, you see that the universe is bright, and this tells you that brightness is a characteristic of the Creator
To reveal Himself more clearly, He inspired men throughout the centuries to write a book which is the Book of books-the Bible
Its revelation of God, which is very thorough and detailed, far surpasses that which is declared through the created universe
Even though God created the universe to express Himself and used the revelation in the Bible to depict Himself, this was not sufficient
The words He spoke were logical and full of wisdom; moreover, every word He uttered was the truth and not a lie
The God in whom we believe is not just one among many gods nor one chosen from among all the gods; rather, He is the only true God
He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary; moreover, He was born in a manger and grew up in a poor home in Nazareth
At that time many of those people were not clear that He was the very God, and even His disciples knew Him only in a superficial way
After His resurrection when He came into the midst of His disciples and appeared to them they saw Him but did not understand that He was God
After eight days, the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples again while they were gathered in the house, and Thomas was with them
On the one hand, He became a genuine man so that He could die for us as our Redeemer to redeem us from our sins
Our Savior, Jesus Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit to indwell us, possesses not only divinity but also humanity
Because of His divinity we can live out all the glory of divinity, and because of His humanity, we can live out all the virtues of humanity
The glory of God and the virtues of man flow out spontaneously from one who is truly saved and who lives by the Spirit within him
Of all the biographies of the world, there is none like that of the Lord Jesus recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament
When we read these Gospels, not only do we marvel at His divinity, but even more we are moved and attracted by His human virtues
Once we call on His name and receive Him as our Savior, He enters into us, and thereby we have an organic union with Him
When we open ourselves to Him, love Him, and desire to be joined with Him as one, we are filled and possessed by Him every day
According to our position as a sinner and our record of sins and according to the righteous requirement of God's law, we need a Redeemer
He needed to have a real body, not an abstract one but a created one, so that He could shed the blood of a created man for us
In this way He could die for the created man, and the human blood which He shed could make redemption for man's sins
According to the requirement of God's law, the world is under the condemnation of God's righteousness and therefore needs a Substitute
The Lord Jesus became the Son of Man by putting on the body of flesh and blood and gave His life as a ransom on the cross for many
We must confess that our Lord Jesus is God and the Creator, yet He became a creature with the body and the blood of a created man
Based on the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross and the precious blood that He shed, God can declare forgiveness
As our Redeemer, the Lord Jesus was judged on our behalf according to God's righteousness and fully paid the debt of our sins
If anyone calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus, based on the Lord's name and the Lord's blood, God will forgive him
In the last three hours on the cross the Lord Jesus bore the sins of the whole human race and suffered God's righteous judgment
The problem of the record of sins was solved, the question of the law was cleared, and all the barriers between God and man were removed
Within us we have a great deal of unclean and unrighteous thoughts, and in our outward actions we constantly have trespasses and defilement
We still need to be washed by the Lord's precious blood and, at the same time, we also need to be saved by the Lord as the Spirit of life
If we say that after we have believed in the Lord that sin is no longer in us and the root of sin has been eradicated, this is a great error
We should know that after we have believed in the Lord, our sinful nature is still in our flesh and has not been eradicated
It will not be until the time of our rapture, at the redemption of our body, that we can say that our whole being has been fully saved
Today this sinful nature is still within us; if we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us
Before God man not only has the problem of the record of sins and the problem of position but man also has the problem of the sinful nature
In order to save us in His life Christ must be the Spirit so that He can enter into us to be our life and everything
The Spirit is Christ who became the life-giving Spirit to come into us as our resurrection life to save us from the sinful nature within us
With the Redeemer there is redemption through the precious blood; with the Savior there is salvation by the Spirit of life
Even though the law of gravity is very strong, there is a stronger law that can cause an airplane to overcome gravity
Sin not only causes man to suffer eternal punishment, but it also has the power, which is the law of sin, to dominate man from within
God's full salvation consists not only of the redemption through the precious blood but also of the salvation by the Spirit of life
Based on Christ's redemption, God could declare that there is forgiveness of sin; thus, our sins were forgiven
We have received redemption for our sins and our sins have been washed away; therefore, we have no problem before God
As fallen human beings, we not only have an outward position that is condemned before God, but we also have a sinful nature within
The salvation of the Lord Jesus is complete; it deals not only with our outward problem but also with our inward problem
The inward salvation first includes regeneration second sanctification third transformation fourth conformation and fifth glorification
The outward redemption is by the efficacy of the blood, whereas the inward salvation is through the operation of the Spirit
From the time of our regeneration when Christ came into us to be our life, He has been sanctifying us within every day
Just as tea leaves 'tea-ify' water into tea-water, so Christ is 'Christ-ifying' us every day to make us Christ-men
When Christ sanctifies us within continually, we are being transformed and at the same time we are being conformed to His likeness
Today Christ is sanctifying, transforming, and conforming us continually until we see Him in our glorification
God's full salvation includes the aspect of redemption through the precious blood and the aspect of salvation by the Spirit of life
On the night of the Passover, all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, of both men and beasts, were to be stricken by death
When the destroying angel saw the blood on the door, he passed over that house so that all the firstborn in that house were not smitten
He said that as the living Father had sent Him and He lived because of the Father, so he who eats Him, he also shall live because of Him
As they ate, their loins were girded, they had their staffs in their hands, and they were prepared to go out of Egypt at midnight
The blood did not strengthen them; rather, it was their safeguard, their covering, so that God's judgment would pass over them
All those who receive and enjoy Christ by eating Him will definitely be full of the life supply and power within
If we daily eat drink and enjoy Christ we will have the vitality in our daily life to overcome sin the devil the world and our natural self
The Lord Jesus was God who became a man and was put to death on the cross to bear our sins and suffer God's righteous judgment
Concerning the Lord Jesus coming into us as our life someone may ask Since we human beings are so small how can we contain this great Savior
On the one hand, He is the 'power plant' in heaven, and on the other hand, He is the 'indwelling electricity' in us
Our salvation is not merely a matter of saying that we have believed; rather, we must also be 'electrified' in our spirit
Even though some have believed into the Lord in their heart, they do not dare to confess before men that they are believers
We cannot say no, but they have merely obtained righteousness; they have not yet received the salvation in life
Believing in the heart is for justification, whereas confessing with the mouth and calling upon the name of the Lord are for salvation
That God causes every one who believes into Him to have eternal life means that God enters into His believers to be their life
He passed through death and resurrection and has become the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of this process
Christ walked into the tomb, went into Hades, passed through death, overcame death, and came out of death triumphantly
Christ is in us not only to be our life but also to lead us that we may pass through death, overcome death, and boast against death
The life within us, which is Christ as the Spirit, can bring us out of these deaths by our calling on the name of the Lord
Resurrection means that no event or circumstance can cause us, who have the life of Christ, to be pressed down
Paul treasured Christ's resurrection power, so he said in 3:10, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection'
While we are living among people on earth, many problems, sufferings, persecutions, and slanders often befall us
The Bible reveals to us first that God is both the eternal God and the God who created the universe and all the things therein
The Bible does not give us some doctrines in letter; rather, it reveals this life-giving Spirit who has become our life and reality
In the Old Testament, God wanted His people to keep the feasts; He did not teach them to bow down, kneel down, or 'kowtow' before Him
In the beginning, when there was the tree of life, there was no need for the shedding of blood because there was not yet the problem of sin
In the New Testament, in the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life, the manna that came down out of heaven, for us to eat
He took up the cup, saying that that was His blood which was being poured out for them and that they should take and drink of it
We can see that the life-giving Spirit is transfigured from the God who was the Word and who became flesh as the last Adam
Concerning resurrection, Paul told us that the Lord Jesus was like a seed that fell into the ground and died and then grew out of the ground
From that time onward this holy Breath, which was the Holy Spirit, entered into the disciples to be with them, never to leave them
In Him there are also the redeeming death, the death that terminated the old creation and all its things, and the resurrection power
Because we have Christ in us, though our body is dead because of sin, our spirit is life because of righteousness
Philippians 1:19 shows us that the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, has the bountiful supply
Divinity, humanity, the experience of human living, the effectiveness of death, and the power of resurrection are all in this Spirit
Sometimes what our mind thinks, what our emotion desires, and what our will resolves cannot obtain the approval of our conscience
People often say, 'I speak with my conscience'; this means that they do not speak according to their mind, emotion, or will
Our every move and action and everything we say or do should be by the Spirit, not by our mind, emotion, and will
Christ is God who became a man and was crucified on the cross to die and shed His blood for us to be our Redeemer
If we were not regenerated and did not have the life of God, we could never become the members of the organic Body of Christ
He was crucified on the cross and died by shedding His blood for us to accomplish the work of redemption and become our Redeemer
The processed Triune God passed through incarnation, thirty-three and a half years of human living, and crucifixion
He went into death and experienced Hades, coming out with a great victory, and then He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit
Our God is the eternal, infinite God in eternity, yet He entered into the womb of a created virgin for His conception
When the Holy Spirit entered into Mary's womb, that was the eternal, infinite God entering into Mary's womb for her to conceive a child
God entered into the womb of the virgin Mary a small created being and stayed there for as long as nine months and then was born in a manger
The Lord Jesus' being born through the conception of the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb was the process of God's incarnation
When He reached the age of thirty, He went out to preach, perform miracles, and declare God the Father for three and a half years
When one calls upon the name of the Lord Jesus, immediately he receives the Lord Jesus as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, as his life
When the disciples preached the gospel, many repented, called upon the name of the Lord, and thus were regenerated
They have received the life-giving Spirit as life in them, and they have all been placed on the same line, which is the line of life
There are many electric lamps in a meeting place, yet the electricity in the lamps and the electricity in the power plant are one
There is a great deal of the fellowship of electricity between the lamps in a meeting place and the power plant
If we live in our soul and body instead of living in the flow of life in our spirit, the flow of the fellowship of life will be cut off
If we all live in the spirit, having fellowship with one another and with God in spirit, then the church is here
When he considers the elders, they are not good; when he considers this brother and that sister, neither the brother nor the sister is good
When they have no more opinions and reasonings and turn from their soul to their spirit, the reality of the church will be manifested
When the brothers and sisters come to the meetings, they all live in their spirit, joyfully shouting hallelujah
They all live in the spirit, walk according to the spirit, serve in coordination in the spirit, and express Christ in the spirit
If we call on the name of the Lord every day, pray-read the Word, and drink of the one Spirit, we will be filled with the Holy Spirit within
We will experience the unlimited supply of the power of the Spirit, and we will be strong and living in spirit
Through the continuous transforming of the Spirit we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord to be His glorious Body
When the Lord comes back, we will all be transformed into the Lord's glorious image, and we will be exactly the same as He is
What we are today is only a miniature, but in that day we will be the full manifestation of the Body of Christ
