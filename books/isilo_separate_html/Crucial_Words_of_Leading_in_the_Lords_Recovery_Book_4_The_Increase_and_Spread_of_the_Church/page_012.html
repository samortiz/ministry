THE MEETINGS FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h2>
<p>Based on Acts 2:46, 5:42, and 20:20, small groups met from house to house. These three verses show that the church life of the saints in Jerusalem was mainly in the homes; the homes were the base. They broke bread, prayed, taught the truth, and preached the gospel from house to house. This is not something we invented; we discovered this by reading the Bible, and now we are presenting it to you. Since the Bible speaks of these four things, we should study how to break bread, pray, teach the truth, and preach the gospel from house to house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING STATISTICS AND HAVING A PLAN<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>From now on, we should use our statistics to understand our true situation more clearly. With these statistics we can make a plan. A plan involves more than a vow. Nothing can be done in a good way without a plan. Government organizations and large companies all have a business plan, but even a family or a single person should have a plan. A college student should not be impulsive; rather, he should know when he will graduate, when he should begin to look for a job, how much his monthly income should be, and how much money he can spend each month. If he does not have a plan, it will be easy to buy things that he cannot afford.</p>
<p>While we need a budget plan for income and expenses, we should also have a budget for our life. A person who desires to be married should have a &ldquo;marriage budget,&rdquo; that is, a consideration of things such as when to get married and the level of education and age of his or her spouse. Once there is the budget plan, he or she should pray earnestly, &ldquo;Lord, by Your mercy I am standing here today. I need a spouse who at least has a college education and who is within five years of my age. Lord, may You bestow grace upon me.&rdquo; We should all have a plan and pray to the Lord earnestly.</p>
<p>In the same principle, if we want the church to increase and spread, we must have a plan. If our plan is to have an annual increase equal to one hundred percent, doubling every year, then we will reach three hundred twenty-five thousand in six years. If we plan for a fifty percent increase, we will reach a similar number in ten years. Since any plan involves the church corporately, every member must contribute his or her part, including how many people to bring to the Lord each year and how to bring them in. Everything should be planned; we should not lack focus, expressing agreement with the church but returning home to sleep in peace. Without a plan we will not have even a one percent increase. The church must have a corporate plan, and the saints must have a personal plan.</p>
<p>The personal plan must be very practical and specific. For example, in a thorough consideration before the Lord, you can draw up a list of names of relatives and friends. You can narrow it down to a few who could be saved and then make them your target, praying for them specifically. You must pray until you even dream about them. If you have time to write letters, you can write to them or send them a few verses. After months of prayer, consideration, and contact, you will gain them as fellow believers.</p>
<p>A young person can consider his schoolmates and think about how to pray for them, how to speak to them concerning the gospel, and how to lead them and invite them to a home. Even if they are annoyed with you, you should still seek them out. Eventually, there will be a few who will listen, receive the gospel, and believe. We know of many stories like this. We can apply this way not only to relatives, friends, and schoolmates but also to colleagues and neighbors. When we make a plan in these areas, we need to be like a person planning to open a restaurant. He needs to consider how to attract customers, including whether he should distribute leaflets to his neighbors to notify them or to invite relatives and friends for a free meal. He cannot wait until the restaurant opens and then go to the roadside to notify people. In the universe, only God can produce something out of nothing. Since we are not God, we cannot expect instant, but unplanned, results. Therefore, we need a plan. Since we all agree that the church should have an increase equal to one hundred percent, each of us should go home and make a proper plan.</p>
<p>One day you and I will all stand before the Lord, and I believe at that time the Lord will ask each one of us a question based on John 15: &ldquo;Did you bear any fruit? How much fruit did you bear?&rdquo; How will we answer? It is not a miracle but a duty for a tree to bear fruit, because of the laws of nature. The people in the charismatic movement superstitiously believe in miracles, thinking that if they pray to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will be poured down and many people will be saved instantly. Actually, the number of people who are saved through the charismatic movement and who remain is very small because they do not work according to the &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; revealed in the Bible. The Bible speaks of the believers as being branches of the vine; branches bear fruit as a matter of nature, not as a consequence of miracles.</p>
<p>The Lord in whom we believe is real and living; He does not act on superstitious impulses. We should act according to His word because we will be accountable to Him based on His word. He said, &ldquo;You are the branches...In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&rdquo; (vv. 5, 8). How can He be pleased if we bear no fruit? I implore you to earnestly consider this message and to have a plan before the Lord. We all need to say, &ldquo;Lord, my past days have been consumed by locusts. Forgive me. I pray that You will have mercy on me; redeem this year for me so that I can bear at least two fruit.&rdquo; This is not such a difficult matter. May the Lord have mercy on us. The aggregate sum of each of our plans will enable the number of people to double or even triple. In this way the church will surely increase, spread, and flourish.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
