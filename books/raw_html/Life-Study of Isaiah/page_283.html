<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Being Made Leader and Savior</H2><P>In His ascension Christ was made Leader (the Ruler of the kings of the earth, King of kings) and Savior (Acts 5:31; Rev. 1:5a; 17:14a; 19:16a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Leader to Rule over the Unbelievers</H2><P>Christ was made Leader (the Ruler of the kings of the earth, King of kings) to rule over the unbelievers. All the unbelievers today, regardless of how unruly they are, are under Christ's ruling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Savior to Save the Believers</H2><P>Christ was made Savior to save the believers. He is both the Leader (the Ruler) and the Savior. Christ is the Leader (the Ruler) to the unbelievers and the Savior to us, the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Ordained to Be the Great High Priest</H2><P>In His ascension Christ was ordained to be the great High Priest (Heb. 4:14; 7:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Minister to the Believers the Heavenly Things with All the Riches of the Heavenly Christ</H2><P>Christ was ordained to be such a High Priest to minister to the believers the heavenly things with all the riches of the heavenly Christ (Heb. 8:1-2). Today the Christ whom we enjoy is not an earthly Christ but a heavenly Christ. If Christ were not in the heavens, He would not be so rich or so high. Today, the very Christ whom we enjoy is in the heavens as a Priest, ministering Himself to us with the things of the heavens.</P><P>Many Christians hold the understanding that the ministry of Christ includes only His incarnation, that is, His becoming a man, His death on the cross for our sins, and His resurrection that we may be resurrected with Him. I would not say that this is wrong, but this is only a small part of Christ's ministry. Today, Christ continues His ministry in the heavens. This is His heavenly ministry. In executing such a ministry, He is the Lord in the heavens, the Christ, the Head, and the great High Priest. As such a One He is busy today in the heavens. First, He is building up His universal Body. In the old creation Christ as the almighty One simply spoke a word, and things came into being (Gen. 1:3; Psa. 33:9). But in the new creation, He must do a lot of work in order to build up His Body. Then, concerning the world, concerning the great image in Daniel 2, Christ must do a lot of work. In recent world events, it seems that the United Nations is exercising its control over certain nations, but actually, Christ is controlling all the nations. Christ is administrating the entire world situation. Although Communism is a formidable system, it could remain in Russia for only seventy years. For this we must give the glory, the praise, to the Ruler of the entire earth. Christ is busy; He is preparing the situation, the environment, and the time so that He can come back with the eternal kingdom of God. He is getting everything ready so that He can return to smash that great image precisely on the ten toes, to defeat Antichrist, the ten kings, and their armies (Dan. 2:34-35; Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-16, 19-21). For the past forty-five years all the nations have been busy competing in the realm of military might. Today, Christ and the Antichrist also are preparing. One day there will be an ultimate war, which will be at Armageddon (16:16). In that war Christ will lead God's army, and Antichrist will lead Satan's army. Two armies will fight there. Christ is preparing His army. That army needs us to be overcomers, whom Christ will marry as His bride. Christ's bride will be His army (19:7-8, 11, 14). Today Christ is doing a lot of work in the heavens to prepare for that day.</P>
