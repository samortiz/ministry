   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING THE INCLUSIVENESS AND UNLIMITEDNESS OF CHRIST BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The apostle Paul wrote the book of Philippians during his imprisonment in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was mistreated there and may have expected to be martyred soon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, he said in Philippians 1:19 that he knew that his suffering would turn out for him to salvation because of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was not preaching ethics or morality; what he preached was the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Spirit has a bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This bountiful supply, which is all-inclusive and unlimited, enables us to endure what others cannot endure and to bear what others cannot bear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Ephesians 3:17 Paul said, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Make home here is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ makes His home in our entire being, we can experience the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the breadth?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the length?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the height?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the depth?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How deep is to be deep?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How high is to be high?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul indicated that the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the boundless dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why Paul said that the Lord's riches are unsearchable as the breadth, length, height, and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul experienced Christ to an extent that he reached the boundless dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, he knew that Christ's endurance, love, power, and wisdom are unlimited, and everything of Christ is boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He knew from experience that when we become His multiplication and increase and thereby experience Him, we will realize that our Lord is infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is all-inclusive and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES HINGING ON THIS SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This experience altogether depends on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The operation of electrical appliances, such as light bulbs, radios, microphones, televisions, audio and video tape recorders, and even computers, hinges on electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the electricity is cut off, all the electrical appliances stop their operation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All Christians' experiences of multiplication and increase depend on the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, the vision we have seen by the Lord's grace is that this Spirit is the key to all our spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not doctrines, religion, history, or any trend, but this all-inclusive and infinite Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Christ today is the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the reality of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we live in this Spirit, and when this Spirit flows out of us, we are the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When this reality is expressed in a locality, this expression is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Universally speaking, it is the universal church, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS OPERATING IN MANY WAYS TO MAKE US THE MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now this all-inclusive Christ is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is sent as the seven Spirits to all the earth, working in us in many ways to make us, one by one, His duplication, multiplication, and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, at His coming, there will be the manifestation of the kingdom, and the ultimate manifestation will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are His multiplication and increase, and when we live in this multiplication and increase, we become His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This testimony grows and increases day by day, first as the church, then as the kingdom, and lastly as the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord open our eyes and save us from our traditional and religious perspectives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In actuality we are not Christianity; rather, we are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This living Christ who is in us makes us who believe in Him His multiplication and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To us, to live is Him; hence, we are His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This testimony is not only individual but also corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First it is the church, then it is the kingdom, and lastly it is the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
