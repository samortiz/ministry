 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS<br />
OF THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 3:1-6; Acts 9:32; 1 Tim. 1:16; Rom. 15:16; 12:1-2; Col. 1:28-29; Rev. 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:9, 5; Luke 10:1-6; John 15:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The turn from the Old Testament priests to the New Testament priests:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The turn in John the Baptist:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Though he can be considered the last priest of the Old Testament, he rejected that priesthood and turned away from being such a priest&mdash;Matt. 3:1-4.</li>
		<li>He turned to become the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He did not offer bulls and goats as offerings.</li>
			<li>Instead, he offered the repentant sinners gained through him as offerings&mdash;Matt. 3:5-6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Continuing through the apostles and every believer:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With the apostles taking the lead to be the New Testament priests of the gospel, preaching the gospel extensively&mdash;Acts 9:32.</li>
		<li>With the Apostle Paul as a pattern&mdash;1 Tim. 1:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He was a New Testament priest of the gospel, preaching the gospel to save people and offering them to God as offerings&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
			<li>He led the believers under his care to offer up themselves as living sacrifices&mdash;Rom. 12:1-2.</li>
			<li>He presented the perfected saints, in all wisdom full-grown in Christ to God&mdash;Col. 1:28-29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>With all believers as the components of God&rsquo;s New Testament priesthood of the gospel&mdash;Rev. 1:5b-6; 5:9-10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It being a universal priesthood, and not a priesthood of a few people.</li>
			<li>It being for the preaching of the gospel, the telling out of the virtues of God&rsquo;s salvation, saving people to offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9, 5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way for the New Testament priests of the gospel to fulfill their duty:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As a New Testament priest of the gospel, every believer must personally preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, saving sinners and offering them up to God as offerings&mdash;Luke 10:1-6.</li>
	<li>As branches of the vine, being sent forth to bear fruit; this being a work not to be replaced by others&rsquo; labor&mdash;John 15:16.</li>
	<li>This being the way ordained by God and revealed in the Bible:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be God&rsquo;s New Testament priest of the gospel, one must personally save the sinners and offer them to God.</li>
		<li>To be a branch in the Lord, one must also personally bear fruit for God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In this message we will consider &ldquo;the New Testament priest of the gospel.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;priest of the gospel&rdquo; has been in the Chinese Bible for over a hundred years; it was not noticed by the students of the Bible. I have personally read the Bible for over sixty years. I had not paid attention to this term before either. I have heard many people preaching and have read many spiritual books, but I never heard, nor did I notice this term. It was not until March of this year, while I fellowshipped with the elders in Taipei, that the Holy Spirit enlightened me to see what Paul said in Romans 15:16 concerning being a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God.</p>
