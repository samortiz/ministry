   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God created man, He gave man a free will, so that now there are three wills in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One is the will of God, the second is the will of Satan, and the third is the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man wonders why God would not destroy Satan quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God would not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wants man to join Him in dealing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has His will, Satan has his will, and man also has his will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God wants man's will to be joined to Him; He does not want to destroy Satan alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not fully understand, but we know that God wants to do it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not want to act alone; He wants man to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the responsibility of the church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to do something, God must first put His will within us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will only accomplish something after we have echoed it in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God operates through this procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He works this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wants man's cooperation; He wants a will that is one with Him and that echoes Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God does everything without us, then man does not need to be here, and we do not need to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet every part of God's will needs someone to carry it out, and He wants our will to become one with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first step in carrying out His will is to pray out God's will and utter His will through our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this we see that prayer is a work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no work more important than this work because prayer is the speaking of God's will and the accomplishment of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, we have to know that God's will is uttered through our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, prayers that originate from our self-will are useless prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prayers that are according to God's will originate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He conveys His will to us through the Holy Spirit, and then we return the same thought to Him through our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Prayers that are after God's heart have God's will as the starting point; man is merely the transmitting and responding organ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Prayer that originates from ourselves has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In reading church history, we find that every great revival began with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prayer enables God to do what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, yet we can delay what He does want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is absolute, and we cannot change Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, and we cannot ask Him not to do what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if God needs a channel to carry out His will and we do not cooperate with Him, His work will be hindered on account of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, when we pray, we are not asking God to do what He does not want to do, and we are not asking Him to change His will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we are declaring God's will in prayer so that He can do what He intends to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we think that by begging desperately we can make God do what He does not want to do, we are wasting our energy; the effort is fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God does not want to do something, no one can make Him do it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only do one thing, and that is to pray for God to do what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God will accomplish His work through our oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The descending of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was prophesied a few hundred years prior to its occurrence, in the time of Joel Yet many disciples had to pray before the Holy Spirit would descend on them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God had ordained it already, but there had to be men who prayed before it could be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although God can do everything alone, He loves to wait for man to pray before He does anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God can do many things, but He is waiting for our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is willing to accomplish many things, but He is waiting for our willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is ready to do many things, but without our consent, He still has to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, although we cannot force God to do what He does not want to do, we can ask Him to do what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have lost many spiritual blessings because we have not expressed God's will through our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It would be wonderful if we could engage ourselves exclusively in the work of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is waiting for man to cooperate with Him so that He can accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some Christians have asked why God does not save more sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why does He not make every believer victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We sincerely believe that God would do these things, if there were men who first prayed for them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is not reluctant to work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is waiting for a group of people who will cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as man cooperates with God, He will work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is much spiritual work to be done, but God is waiting for His children to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether or not the work will succeed depends on how God's children pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should respond to God by consenting to work together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is waiting to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The question is whether or not we will ask.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who do not know God will say, "If God wants to do anything, He can do it all by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why is there the need for our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God knows everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we pray too much, we may tire Him out."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to remember that man has a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God will not act contrary to His will, but neither will He take over man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If man does not pray for God's will, He has to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If He wants His will to be done on earth as in heaven, He can do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Why does He need the disciples to pray, "Our Father who is in the heavens...Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth"?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If God wants His kingdom to come, He can do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why is there the need for His disciples to pray, "Your kingdom come"?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If God wants His name to be sanctified by all people, He can do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why does He have to ask the disciples to pray, "Your name be sanctified"?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The answer to these questions is that God does not want to do anything alone; He wants man's cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God is powerful, but we have to lay the tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more tracks we lay, the more God works.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, our prayers should be like a railway network, the more the better.</S>
