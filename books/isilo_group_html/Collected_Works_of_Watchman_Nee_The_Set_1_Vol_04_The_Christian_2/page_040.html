He wanted them to remember from where they had fallen. He wanted them to remember their former condition and weep for their present situation. He wanted them to lament saying, "I wish I could be like I was!" or "I wish I could return to the condition of a few months ago!" The remembrance of one's former condition will stir up in him repentance and aspiration. This is the first step towards revival. The remembrance of one's former experience will recover one's former position. A fallen saint cannot skip the step of "remembering."</P><P>"Remember therefore where you have fallen from." A perfect church in man's view is but a "fallen" church in the Lord's evaluation! Although the Lord praised their many activities, He could not help but call them the fallen ones! Our position before the Lord does not depend on how much we labor but on how much we have loved. Of course, when we have the love, we will have the labor also. No matter how much we work, if we have lost the love to the Lord, we are a fallen one. Adam had fallen. Israel had also fallen. It is a pity that even the church that has received God's grace and blessing has also fallen! However, God still gave them the chance. Hence, we should "remember therefore where [we] have fallen from."</P><P>The most important thing for a fallen Christian to do is to examine under God's light from where he has fallen. If we have not recovered the lost ground, even though our outward work may continue to be the same, our spiritual condition has already suffered a great blow. If a failure is not confessed before the Lord and cleansed by the blood, we may make further outward progress, but our years will be spent in vain. From where we have fallen, there we should return and should renew our onward journey. Our life after the fall is a journey in vain and is not reckoned by God unless we return back to the point of the fall and resume our walk from there. From where we fall, to there we must turn. The unfortunate thing is that after the saints have fallen, they still carry on with their activities. They do not realize that the foundation of their love to the Lord has been shaken already! In recalling the nature of our fall and the line from where we have backslidden, we should return to the starting point. This is the most important teaching in the Bible. This is true with individuals; it is also true with the church. If we want to know the true condition of the church today, we have to compare it with the apostolic church at the time of Pentecost. By this we will see if the church has degraded or advanced. As Ephesus had to remember from where it had fallen, in the same way the church today and the saints in it should not skip this step.</P><P>"And repent!" Amazing word! Does the church need to repent? There is a big difference between the repentance of the world and the repentance of the church. The latter has been washed by the blood and regenerated by the Holy Spirit. It does not need to repent of its dead works like the worldly people do. For the church, it is a matter of defilement in life and a loss in the love to the Lord. For this it has to return to its former position. Among the seven churches, the Lord charged five to repent! Repentance is a common need among the saints. It is easy to work busily and have enduring labor, but repentance is the most difficult thing for us to have. It is also the thing that we dislike the most. Although works of beating the air are exhausting, nevertheless, they do not require one to humble himself. It is therefore still bearable to the flesh. In addition, it wins a good name for a man. To confess one's mistakes and to repent of one's sin, on the other hand, will rob the flesh of its ground for exercise and will strip it of its glory. It even requires that one lay aside his own face and others' praises. How difficult this is! It is not that we are reluctant to serve the Lord, but we would much rather serve the Lord in a way that would not require us to do something that is too humiliating for us and which would sacrifice the achievements that we boast in. This kind of repentance is too embarrassing for us! It is alright for the sinners to do this, but for a saint to do this is too unsettling to his self-righteous heart! But then, the cross is not something up to our choice. Our duty is to be children of submission and slaves of obedience. Empty works may gain for us some adulation from man, but if they do not please the Lord, what profit is there? If the heart of our beloved Lord is not satisfied, even though we may have absolute contentment, we should relinquish it. If the saints were willing to have the same view as the Lord, there would not be so little repentance as there is today! If the heart of the Lord in the Holy Place is not satisfied, even if there are works that please others and oneself, we must ask for whom are these works done? If by the grace of God we would understand the Lord's view and would look at our present work from the view of eternity, we will realize the emptiness of our work and will esteem the value of pleasing the Lord. Of course, when we realize our lack in this way, we cannot help but be sorrowful in heart and repentant in spirit. However, the price of this self-humiliation and renunciation of glory is not small!</P><P>"Do the first works." This is the result of repentance. Without repentance there will not be a self-condemning heart. Without a self-condemning heart, we will remain in oldness and will not be renewed. If there is repentance, there must not only be the recovery of the first feeling, but the doing of the first works. What is it to do the first works? It must not be merely outward "works," for the Ephesians had that already. Neither must it be "labor," for the Ephesians have that also. It is not "endurance" either because they also have this. It is not being zealous to oppose sin. It is not being bold to try the falsehood. Neither is it suffering untiringly for Christ's name sake. All these are excellent in God's eyes and are acceptable, and the Ephesians had all these already. But the Lord Jesus went on to say that He had something against them, which was that they had left their first love. Hence, what is it to "do the first works"? Why did the Lord ask them to do the first works? Were not their works acceptable and praised already? If they were not the works the Lord praised, what then were the "first works"? Outwardly speaking, the first works are not much different from the former works of the Ephesians, but there is a difference in the motivating power and the goal. The works are the same, but the power that motivates the works is different. The "first love" is the same work with different motives. The "first works" are works that issue from the "first love." Although a saint's work may be exactly the same now as before, a difference in the inward motive will result in God's rebuke or praise. A work that issues from a heart filled with the zeal of the Lord's love is precious in the Lord's eyes. Concerning this He has no rebuke. Although a work that only satisfies the eyes presents no difference to others outwardly, it is not pleasing to the Lord who searches the heart of man. God's eyes are on our motive, and He judges accordingly. In the future at the judgment seat, many saints will be surprised at the amount of wood, hay, and stubble they possess. To them, all these works are important and valuable. How is your motive? This is the standard of God's judgment. All works that are not done out of love to the Lord, though they may be as numerous, perfect, and great as that of the Ephesians, are bound to be condemned. All other works are naturally even worse.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
