   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can we have our will strengthened?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's presence, as you receive the Word and touch the Spirit, will benefit you in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This habit of contacting Him will make your mind sober, without your even thinking about it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It will affect your emotions too.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may not ask the Lord to strengthen your will, but contacting Him will strengthen it unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How is it that after so many years of being a Christian, there doesn't seem to be any change in me?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why do I still lose my temper?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Should we expect to improve?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I understand your problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Day after day a mother takes care of her children, but she can see very little change in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She does not do anything purposely to make them grow, but by feeding them properly and by regulating their behavior, exercise, and sleep, little by little they are changing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The time will come when they will be full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is our Christian growth stunted?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is from our failure to take in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our eating and drinking are deficient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the main point of our meetings is guitar playing and singing the Psalms, we may enjoy ourselves, but year after year there will be no change in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as our human life requires that we eat, drink, sleep, and breathe, so for our spiritual life we must contact the Lord and take in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our meetings must also supply us with the solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result will be transformation, not by any outward doing, but by the life supply dispensed into us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We shall change.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the proper way to handle saints who would push "windy teachings" on you?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This requires wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Arguing with them is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you realize they cannot take your word, don't say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But you must be nourished with the good things of the Word and be faithful to attend all the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Time will show how you have grown, while those who persist in looseness remain degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A new sister is having a hard time reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can I help her?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Help her to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the new ones need such help to open them up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How does a young person get started on studying the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As I have previously mentioned, you must have your morning nourishment and your daily reading of four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For study, you first select a book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To get into it thoroughly, studying every word, you need reference books and some good translations, like Darby's and the American Standard Version.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Greek-English interlinear translation is a help, as is Young's or Strong's Concordance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By these means you will find out the proper meaning of the words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will help you to interpret and expound the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must do this consecutively and continually, not according to your whim.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After you have studied the book in this way, you may come back to study the major topics of that book.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans, for example, has such topics as justification, reconciliation, sanctification, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can study the distinction between sin and sins, between being in Adam and in Christ, etc. By going through a book verse by verse and then studying its major subjects, you will become thoroughly familiar with it and gain the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then take another book.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would especially benefit you to go through Matthew, John, Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In reading through the Old Testament, sometimes you go through a dry period.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can we get through this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If this reading is part of your four chapters, just let it be dry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The genealogy in Matthew 1 may be a frustration to you, but reading it still profits you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Scripture is God's breath; it refreshes you whether you understand it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Further, when you come around to read it the next time, or the third time, you will find that it is less and less dry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have come to cherish those first seventeen verses in Matthew 1; they are rich and solid.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you read the Bible, don't try to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may even need to pray sometimes, "Lord, help me not to try to understand Your Word"!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just understand as much as you can; the next time you read it, you will have more understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can we gain more knowledge of the Son of God Eph 4:13 ?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Would it be through studying, memorizing, pray-reading, or how?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I encourage you to read and study as much as you can.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is better than memorizing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From your reading and studying you will spontaneously remember.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The study of the Bible requires your whole mentality and much of your time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever we do with the Bible is a benefit, but spending the time to study is more useful, I think, than exercising so much to memorize.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Your study of the Scriptures will be helped by referring to other books too, especially the recovery books that we have printed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we come to contact the Lord, is it better to pray first or to read first?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Usually I find that I contact the Lord before I get to the Bible on my desk.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By saying "O Lord" I am in the spirit already, before I open my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please do not think that meditating on Him is helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You will no sooner close your eyes to meditate than your thoughts will travel to your nagging mother-in-law, then on to London, to Hong Kong, or elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The prevailing way to touch the Lord is to be in the spirit and in the Word; then you will fully enjoy Christ.</S>
