   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING ROMANS 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apart from the four negative things mentioned above, we cannot find a fifth item in the New Testament concerning which we should be strict in accepting others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, the New Testament commands us to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, it does not say that we should reject a person if he does not follow the teaching about loving others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same is true regarding the doctrine of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 13 the Lord Jesus speaks of washing one another s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this chapter does not say that we should refuse to have fellowship with another believer because he does not practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same principle, although the New Testament speaks emphatically about baptism, we are never told to reject a believer because he has not been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not separate ourselves from those believers who differ from us in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to remember Romans 14 and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today many Christian teachers are talking about the Body in Romans 12 without paying adequate attention to Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apart from Romans 14 we cannot practice the Body life revealed in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only through being liberal toward others with respect to doctrine can we have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among many Christians today there is no practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, there is division after division.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, there is more division among earnest Christians than among those who are worldly or indifferent to the Lord and His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Christians are revived and renewed in reading the Bible, they are more easily divided over doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of the divisiveness in today s Christianity, most Christians do not have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is especially true in the charismatic movement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although many in this movement are fond of talking about the Body, there is more divisiveness in the charismatic movement than in any other aspect of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason for this is that Christians talk about Romans 12, but neglect Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I repeat, only by practicing Romans 14 do we have the reality of the Body described in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Romans 14, there is room in the church life for those with different doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some believe that they can eat everything, whereas others eat only herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, some observe certain days, whereas others regard every day the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you realize that in the church life there can be different doctrines, and there should be?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Take the example of head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some sisters wear a head covering in the meetings, but many sisters do not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that among the sisters there are different doctrines concerning head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a very positive sign that the church can include both those sisters who wear a head covering and those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have been in Christian meetings where sisters without a head covering were not welcome.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the sisters who wear a head covering have different kinds of coverings and coverings of different colors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I have been in meetings where the sisters were required to wear head coverings of the same size, style, and color.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praise the Lord that in the church life we are not divided over different matters such as these!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wonderful that in the church we receive those with different doctrines concerning head covering!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we may differ in doctrine, we are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But those who are preoccupied with doctrine often argue about whether or not certain doctrines or practices are scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we can declare that the most scriptural meeting is the meeting in which believers with different doctrines are received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we contend for the faith and reject the four categories of negative things we have mentioned, we are liberal toward others with respect to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the only way to preserve the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we dispute over doctrine, we shall repeat Christianity s history of division.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>ESCAPING FROM THE SNARE OF DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>About a century and a half ago, the Brethren were raised up by the Lord and came to see many truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Certainly this was of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the Brethren eventually were snared by doctrinal knowledge and were divided again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In some cases they cared more for their interpretation of the Bible than for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, there are hundreds of divisions among the Brethren today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you visit certain Brethren assemblies, they may argue with you about doctrine, yet have little care for the Spirit or for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How pitiful to care for our interpretation of the Bible but to neglect the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Lord s recovery we have escaped from the trap of doctrine and are being brought back to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How I praise the Lord for rescuing me from doctrinal knowledge!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We in the Lord s recovery have no appetite for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the same time, we reject idolatry, fornication, division, and the denial of Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we are strict about these negative things, we are liberal toward others about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not for doctrines, practices, or ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We care only for Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we are truly one.</S>
