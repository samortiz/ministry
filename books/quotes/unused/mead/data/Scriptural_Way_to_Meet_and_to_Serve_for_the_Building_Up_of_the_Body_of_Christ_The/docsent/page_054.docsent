   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD SPOKEN BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter one of the Gospel of John, we are told that the Word was God Himself embodied to be Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Jesus speaks the word, whatever He speaks is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Word today is the Spirit and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because it is the Spirit, it is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord brought me into the line of life many years ago, I saw John 6:63.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From that day my understanding of the Bible was absolutely revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that day I never considered the Bible as something merely printed in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead I began to consider the Bible as the living Spirit and life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we contact the Bible only with our mind, the Bible will be only the letter to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But whenever we contact any part of the Bible with our spirit, that part of the Bible becomes spirit and life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SPIRIT FLOWING IN AND WITH THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit flows in and with the word John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Gospel of John has a very good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sequence in John s Gospel is not according to history or according to doctrine, nor is it according to the standard of morality like the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John s sequence is according to spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter one tells us clearly that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in chapter six, the word is something that comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter seven the Spirit becomes a flow vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First there is the Word, then the Word is the Spirit, and finally the Spirit is a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 7 says that rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord tells us clearly that this flow out from our innermost being is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With what does the Spirit flow from deep within us?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Spirit, who is the flow and who flows from within us, flows with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we speak the living word, bubbling with the word, the Spirit flows with the word we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have the proper word with which to speak, the Spirit cannot flow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why Paul tells us that we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must have a living storage of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then when we speak, the words that are stored within us will become water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the word comes out of us, water comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit can flow in and with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we speak the word, the more the Spirit flows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Word, God, and the Spirit are altogether one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 1 God was the Word, who was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 20, the Lord Jesus Himself became a Spirit that was breathed into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In between John 1 and John 20, there was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word became flesh, and whatever this One spoke was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit flows with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, this One went to the cross, was crucified, and through resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b as the very breath that could be breathed into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, John shows us the Word as God becoming flesh, and eventually this very Word becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today the very Word whom we speak is God Himself, Jesus Christ Himself, and the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Word is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Word has gone through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Triune God is the very essence of this Word, and this essence is altogether contained in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is the Word, the Word became flesh, and this Word today is the Spirit, so we all have to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we have to learn how to exercise to speak this wonderful Word, which is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul refers to the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The antecedent of which is the Spirit, indicating that the Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus indicated that the word is the Spirit, and Paul said that the Spirit is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is like saying Paul is the apostle and the apostle is Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These two are really one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must learn to speak this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To learn to speak any language, we must exercise to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not care about making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Your speaking will correct and improve you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not expect the new ones in a home meeting to speak so correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Children learn to speak by making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more they speak, the more they learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not much adjustment of their speaking is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Children also learn to walk and run by their exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First, they crawl until eventually they learn to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then through much trial and error, they learn to walk and then to run.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All of us can learn to speak by exercising to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must endeavor to have a meeting without a definite speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must put aside the practice of a single speaker in our church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When I hear the saints speaking in a meeting, I may hear incorrect things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But eventually the saints correct themselves when they continue to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sometimes I had the feeling to correct someone, but I decided not to.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we correct too much, no one will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our correcting may make others afraid to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is better to give others the freedom to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When you go to a home meeting, do not correct the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Let them speak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as they speak, that is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the full-time training in Taipei, I charged the trainees not to go to the home meetings of the new ones and become their pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is possible to make yourself the new ones pastor without having the title of a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Recently in Taipei, we began to have district meetings with at least fifty attendants in one district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Among these fifty there might have been ten to twelve good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I charged these saints not to become a corporate pastor of twelve persons in the district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If these twelve do all the speaking, they become a corporate pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This practice can also annul the functions of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must try to speak in a way that leads and guides all the rest to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When the other saints open up their mouths to speak, let them continue the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Give others the ground to speak, and do not try to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you correct them, they may stop speaking and the flow will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Treasure their speaking and even their making of mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Let them speak with the view of their being perfected in their function.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>On the other hand, the saints need to be balanced in their functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Some may like to talk all the time, and they may speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These saints may need some correction and adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Most of the saints do not need this kind of balancing word.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They need to be balanced by learning to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In Hosea 7:8 the Lord likened Israel to an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Cakes that are baked need to be baked on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Many saints may be baked on one side, but not on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We all have to be turned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you shout too much in the meetings, you have to be balanced not to shout that much.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If you would not shout at all, you have to be balanced to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If you shout too low, you have to be balanced to shout louder.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you shout too loud, you need to be balanced to lower your voice.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The burning young ones, however, should not be balanced too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you balance them too fast, the burning fire will be quenched, and this fire may not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Because I speak so much, I make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The more one speaks, the more mistakes he will make.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The best way not to make mistakes is not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The less one speaks, the less mistakes he makes.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the philosophy of the Chinese culture.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Japanese are also very quiet according to their natural constitution in their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>No matter what culture we come from, we all have to deny our self and our natural constitution by exercising to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit.</S>
