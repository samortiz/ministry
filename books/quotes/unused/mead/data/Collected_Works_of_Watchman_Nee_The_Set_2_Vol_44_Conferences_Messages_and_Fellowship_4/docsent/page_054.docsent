   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN A FORETASTE OF THE POWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE AGE TO COME Scripture Reading: Heb 1:13; 2:5, 7-8; 4:9; 6:5; 8:8-12; Matt 5:3; 11:28; 12:29; 16:18; 26:29; Luke 10:18-19; 11:20; 18:30; John 6:47; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>36:26-27; Jer 31:31-34; Rom 6:5; Zech 13:1; Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:16-18; 1 Pet 1:5; Eph 2:8a; 2 Tim 1:10; 1 Cor 15:55; Rev 11:15; 12:9; 20:1-2, 4-5, 14a; Col 1:13 THE POWERS OF THE AGE TO COME God's Riches</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's riches are available for man to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, they are mainly for man to enjoy in the age of the kingdom and not in the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the age of the church God's riches are not as abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the church and the kingdom are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as the church age passes away, the kingdom age will come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of God's provisions for the church are a preparation for the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The salvation described in 1 Peter 1 has to do with the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In God's eyes He has prepared only one set of blessings for those in this age and the next age; there are not two sets of blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, God wants to have a group of people in the church age who will have a foretaste of the riches of the kingdom in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Luke 18, the Lord mentions one kind of eternal life, which we inherit in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is for the kingdom and not for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in John 6 the Lord says, "He who believes has eternal life" v. 47 . Actually, the eternal life that Christians receive in the church age is no different from the eternal life that God's children receive in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the eternal life in the kingdom is a general blessing, whereas the eternal life in the church today is a foretaste and a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Zechariah 13:1 says that in that day there will be an opened fountain for the people of Israel for sin and for impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church believers are already experiencing the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rest</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hebrews 4 mentions another Sabbath rest, which is enjoyed in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in Matthew 11:28 the Lord said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is something that we can enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ezekiel 36:26-27 refers to the kingdom age, in which God will lead the Israelites back to their own land and give them a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church we are regenerated and have a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For God's chosen people, the Israelites, both the indwelling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will be experienced in the kingdom Joel 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in the church today we have a foretaste of these gifts Acts 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jeremiah 31 shows us that the new covenant is something that God will establish with the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But today the church is enjoying all the contents of this new covenant Heb 8:8-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The resurrection spoken of in Revelation 20 is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But today Christians are resurrected with Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Gifts of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joel 2:28-32 tells us that the Holy Spirit will be poured out in the future, but in Acts 2 the church experienced it first.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Annulling of Death</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 20:14 says that death will be thrown into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is something that will happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, 1 Corinthians 15 says that the power of death has been removed in the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>55-57 , and Christ has nullified death 2 Tim 1:10 .</S>
