   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXTENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BELIEVER'S SALVATION Issue No. 15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all know that we are sinners and that we have eternal life through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we want to see to what extent God saves us through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, to what extent will our person be saved by God through Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the last two or three years, I have noticed one thing: I have felt that there is definitely something wrong with my personal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I read the Bible, I confess that I do not have what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the Christian life of some seems to be worse than mine, and although some who have deeper experiences have answered my questions by saying that I have already attained, I still feel that I do not have what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now I know!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Indeed there are better things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Indeed these better things can be obtained and can be obtained even now.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So, today what I want to talk about is the extent of our heritage in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not about the future heritage in heaven something which we will have in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not talking about eternal life something which we have through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not talking about the glory in the kingdom something which will be ours in the millennium to come.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we want to emphasize the extent to which God can save us as persons today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us read some verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will read them one by one as we move along.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We want to see the extent to which God can save us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I. CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse speaks of the extent to which Christ saves our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His blood can purge our conscience from dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please ask yourselves today if there are still accusations in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If from time to time there are still accusations in your conscience, then what you have obtained is not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord saves us, and His blood purges our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our conscience can be purified by His blood from every kind of self-accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we gather together, we pray, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thank You that our hearts have been sprinkled from an evil conscience."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But many times we still feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we have done is just a cover-up and a mental gloss-over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the blood of God's Son does purify.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If your conscience still accuses you, it does not mean that God's salvation cannot save you to that extent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It merely means that the salvation which you have received is not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He can save us to such an extent!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is possible for our conscience to be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>HEART</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mark 7:21-23 says, "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these wicked things proceed from within and defile the man."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Also Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two verses speak of the original defiled condition of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They also tell us how Christ can save our heart to the extent of being pure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The heart mentioned in Mark is our natural heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What about this heart?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord said that all evil things come from men's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these evils are from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the Lord said, "Blessed are the pure in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord is able to save such a bad heart to the extent of being pure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The salvation of our heart does not mean the suppression of the inward evils so that they do not break loose.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The salvation of our heart means that our heart is cleansed from within.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we plan to cover up or seal up, this is not salvation, because we have not been saved by God to the extent of being pure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to ask God, "How many evil thoughts are there in my heart?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How much deceit?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How much jealousy?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How much pride?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If all these are merely suppressed inside us and we are merely covering them up tightly, our heart has not been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What God says is, "Blessed are the pure in heart!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today our shortcomings, problems, and lack of testimony are due to the fact that our heart has not been cleansed to that extent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many times we see someone sin, but we dare not reproach him, because we realize that this person's outward condition is but the blossoming of sin; the seed of this blossom is also in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although we do not love the world like some, our hearts are nevertheless affected.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are no different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we do not have a pure heart, we do not have a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God would not leave any filthiness in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even a heart that is as evil as the one mentioned in Mark can be saved by God to the extent of being clean.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God can save us until we have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We praise and thank God that He can save us to such an extent!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He can deliver such an evil heart to become a pure heart.</S>
