   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S MOVE IN CHINA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We did not do something on our own in order to have a unique style.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, we studied church history and compared everything with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1922 Brother Nee began the first meeting in Foochow, which is in southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was more than sixty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meetings in northern China began in Chefoo in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The responsibility for the meetings in northern China fell mainly on me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been in the Lord s recovery from 1932 until today, 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is a total of fifty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since 1827 when the Lord raised up the British Brethren, the light of the truth has been pouring out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were several famous Bible teachers among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most famous Bible teacher was J. N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Brethren published many books that have helped countless Christians over the past one hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Spurgeon once praised a teacher from the Brethren named William Kelly and said that Kelly s mind was as great as the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>C. H. Mackintosh wrote Notes on the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. L. Moody once pointed to his personal collection of books and said, You can burn all the books on these shelves except for the Bible and Mackintosh s Notes on the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that the truth that the Brethren received had a great influence on others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the last half century, Christianity in America has been influenced mainly by the Scofield Reference Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The top American theological seminaries, such as Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible Institute, base their teachings on the Scofield Reference Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>More than ninety percent of the notes in the Scofield Reference Bible are based on the Brethren teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though these theological seminaries did not take the way of the Brethren, they fully accepted the teachings of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China; that was after the first war in Europe which ended in 1918.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time many spiritual books were put out in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only were the Brethren publishing spiritual books; other believers were also putting out books.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The books of Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis were quite influential.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There were also books by C. H. Spurgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most of his books were published in England and were highly valued.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In America books by A. B. Simpson were published.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have included many of his hymns in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. B. Simpson founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simpson was spiritual, and his messages that contain the basic revelation concerning Christ as our life are well-known.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CHRISTIANITY NOT MAKING PROGRESS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FOR MANY YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It has been thirty-nine years since the end of the Second World War in 1945.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Based on my knowledge and observation, it is hard to find a weighty spiritual book that was published during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people might say that I am too much and that Christianity puts out many books and magazines.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, not one of these publications is spiritually weighty in scriptural exposition, in the light of the truth, or in the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hong Kong is the center of Christian publications in Chinese, and for the past several years no publications of spiritual weight have been put out from there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The number of weighty spiritual publications that were put out between 1820 and 1930 cannot be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, very few spiritual publications of weight have been put out over the past thirty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many publications have been put out, but not one of them has spiritual weight and value.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the more than twenty years that I have been living in America, I have been observing the books put out in Christianity; some of the brothers have been helping me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is difficult to find a book or a message that contains the light of truth or the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, a group of scholars have done an excellent work over the past ten years and put out several lexicons for the Greek New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These books have helped us tremendously.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I began to use the Greek New Testament in the winter of 1932, and I have continued using it for the past fifty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though I do not understand Greek literature, I can be considered an expert on the usage of Greek words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the Greek lexicons published in the past cannot compare to the quality of the Greek lexicons that were published during the past ten years in America.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, with respect to light, truth, life, and scriptural exposition, the situation in America is just as poor as everywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christian publishers in America have no way other than to reprint old books.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the situation in all of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the progression of the history of Christianity from after the apostles until the present.</S>
