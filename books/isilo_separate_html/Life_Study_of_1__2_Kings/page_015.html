SEEKING FOR GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Loving Jehovah and Walking<br>in the Statutes of David His Father</H2><P>One very positive point concerning Solomon was his seeking for God (1 Kings 3:2-4). He loved Jehovah and walked in the statutes of David his father (v. 3a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Sacrificing and Burning Incense<br>in the High Places</H2><P>On the one hand, Solomon was seeking God. On the other hand, he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places (vv. 3b-4; cf. Deut. 12:5-14). In the Old Testament "high places" is a negative term, for it refers to the places where the Gentile people, the Canaanites, worshipped their idols. In this matter Solomon was foolish and lacking in vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. SEEKING FOR WISDOM</H2><P>First Kings 3:5-15 describes Solomon's seeking for wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Appearing to Him in a Dream</H2><P>Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream and promised to give him whatever he would ask (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Asking Jehovah to Give Him Wisdom and<br>an Understanding Heart to Judge God's People</H2><P>Solomon asked Jehovah to give him wisdom and an understanding heart to judge God's people (vv. 6-9). Wisdom is a matter in our spirit, and understanding is a matter in our mind. The expression "an understanding heart" (v. 9) actually refers to an understanding in our mind because the mind is the main part of the heart. Quite often we may have wisdom in our spirit but are lacking the capacity to understand in our mind. Thus, we need God's wisdom in our spirit and God's understanding in our mind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. His Request Pleasing God</H2><P>Solomon asked God not for prosperity nor for longevity but for wisdom that he might know how to behave himself among God's people for God's kingdom. Solomon's request pleased God, and God promised to give him a heart of wisdom and understanding (vv. 10-12). In addition, God promised to give him riches and glory and longevity, things for which he did not ask (vv. 13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Solomon Understanding<br>Where He Should Offer to God</H2><P>Through this dream in which God appeared to him, Solomon understood where he should offer to God. He did this after he went back to Jerusalem, and he made a feast for all his servants (v. 15).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
