   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM MAN'S THIRD FALL 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we continue our study of the third fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although no one likes to hear the word "fall," we need to realize that the falls portrayed in the book of Genesis are the background of a very positive picture which shows what God has done with the fallen human race.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The main purpose of the record of Genesis is not to show the fall, but to show how much God's grace can do for fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fall is a black background which helps us see a white picture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the black background, the white picture would not be so impressive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 3 we saw man's first fall and what God did for fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 4 we saw man's second fall and something further which God did for the fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we shall see what God did as a result of man's third fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Way of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>from the Third Fall</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we consider the third fall of man, we shall see more of what God has done for fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the first fall, Adam and Eve were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a small thing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Adam and Eve were fallen, they nevertheless were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam said, "Living," and Eve said, "I have acquired."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam and Eve were not saved by themselves, but by Christ who is the Lamb of God and the seed of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After seeing how God dealt with Adam and Eve, we saw that Abel offered sacrifice and gifts to God Heb 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sacrifice was offered for his sins, and gifts were presented for God's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Can a fallen man please God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Abel was a fallen man, but he pleased God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not only saved, he also satisfied God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abel did not please God by and with himself; he pleased God by and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We go from Adam to Abel and from Abel to Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Enosh initiated the matter of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With the case of Enosh, it was not just a matter of salvation or of pleasing God, but of calling on the Lord that man might enjoy all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we proceed from Genesis 4 to Genesis 5, we find even more riches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter five we learn that the saved ones lived, begat, and walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After all of this, there is still more in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis 6 we see that Noah certainly was saved, pleased God, called on the name of the Lord, and enjoyed all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Noah also lived and begat, for he begat three sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition to all of these positive aspects of the life of the saved ones, Genesis 6 shows us even more items.</S>
