   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Christian, whether or not he is a worker, should have his own work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Austin-Sparks used to say, "We can never say if our work is of the Lord, nor can we say how much of our work is of the Lord and how much of it is of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know only after the work has left our hand."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I heard this remark from him seven or eight times during the year I stayed in London.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe this word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a work is no longer in our hand and others criticize it as being not of the Lord, we will feel unhappy, discontented, or uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This proves that the work was a thing, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is not after our work, but after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day our work will go away, but Christ will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul intended to preach in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was recorded in the Acts of the Apostles 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But it was really the non-acts, rather than the acts of the apostles, that were recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our obedience to the Lord depends more on what we do not do than it does on what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In fact much of man's "inactivity" is God's very "activity."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church should realize that all things are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I like the word in Luke 17:7-8: "But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will...not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Plowing is a work to gain the outsiders, whereas tending sheep is a work to take care of the insiders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people pay attention only to the first two works and neglect to "serve me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This service is our service to the Lord apart from our work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A day will come when the Lord will show us how vain and shameful our work has been.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been laboring on things only.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been taking care of the business of the church, but we have not been serving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a very positive light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Behavior</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For many Christians behavior is a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their humility, meekness, and zeal are nothing but performances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, God wants to show us that the very characteristic of Christianity is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet we give others the impression that the characteristic of Christianity is things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of the virtues are good and necessary, yet Paul did not pursue after the knowledge of virtues but the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the unique virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All religions are the same, and they are good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But they only touch the virtues, the things, and not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They touch our conduct, goodness, love, diligence, sacrifice, and suffering for others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, God is after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All He wants is for Christ to do all of the work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He does not care about what we do or what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not see ourselves in a thorough way, we do not see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The real behavior is the Lord working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the Lord who is loving in us, the Lord who is humble in us, and the Lord who is meek in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>CHRIST'S NAME BEING "I AM"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said that His name is "I AM."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No other name in the Old Testament is greater than this name "I AM" Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is the Lord the "I AM" in this and that matter?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the crux of the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In everything we have to ask: Is this the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Two thousand years of Christianity have shown us that everything that is not Christ will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>True Chris- tianity is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is Christ our power?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is Christ our love?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is Christ our meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people can only say that Christ gives them power, love, and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But I will tell you that Christ can do something deeper than this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will not only give you power, love, and meekness, He will be everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only those who take Christ as everything in this way can say, "Christ our life" Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people can recite this verse, but we need a new beginning today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to not only recite this verse, but to live out this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Prayer: Lord, these words are feeble, ineffective, and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many are familiar with them already.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May You speak to us personally and accomplish what no man can accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the Israelites left Egypt once and for all, give us a vision and deliver us from all the substitutes once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, may there be nothing in us that would replace You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All we can do is imitate You, but these imitations are not You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Open up the meaning of the words "Christ our life" to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many of us need to be torn down before we can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May we find Christ everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can say this, but we often do not see it from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May this matter be deeply rooted in us so that we will not see it just once, but all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May we find Christ everywhere, and may Christ be our all because He is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May we testify that Christ is indeed everything in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May Christ be everything to many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May Christ be all of our things, and may we take the lead to experience Christ as the One who is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Your name we pray, amen.</S>
