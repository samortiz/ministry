<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16-17; see also Eph. 3:14-17).</p>
<p>In these two verses the Son prayed to the Father to give the Spirit. Thus, the Father, Son, and Spirit all co-exist. In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ could make His home in our heart. In both portions the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are mentioned. The three co-exist. According to Ephesians 3:14-17, the Father hears our prayer, the Spirit strengthens the believers, and Christ the Son makes His home in their hearts. This clearly shows that the Father, Son, and Spirit co-exist.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:14; see also 1 Cor. 12:4-6).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship, or flowing, of the Holy Spirit, showing that the three co-exist. First Corinthians 12:4-6 speaks of the gifts of the Spirit, the ministries of the Lord, and the operations of God. Here we can see the Spirit, the Lord, and God. Once more this reveals that the Spirit, the Son, and the Father co-exist and work simultaneously. The Spirit gives gifts, the Lord ministers, and the Father operates.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Three Being One</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Son Being the Father</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 9:6).</p>
<p>The baby named Jesus, who was born in a manger in Bethlehem, was called Mighty God. If we believe that the child born to us is the Mighty God, we must also believe that the Son given to us is the Eternal Father. The Son is the Father. This is based on the pure Word of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Son and the Father Being One</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:30).</p>
<p>This word clearly shows that the Son and the Father are one.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Last Adam Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:45).</p>
<p>Jesus is the last Adam, and the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit, there is no other Spirit who can give life, yet this verse clearly indicates that Jesus, who is called the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Lord (the Son) Being the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p><em>Lord</em> in this verse refers to Jesus, and <em>Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. To say that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit is absolutely according to the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head3">All Three Being in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:6).</p>
<p>This verse clearly says that the Father is in us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am...in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:20).</p>
<p>The Son is also in us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory&rdquo;</strong>(Col. 1:27).</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:17).</p>
<p>The Spirit is also in us.</p>
<p>The Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us. This is very clear. According to our experience, however, these three are one because the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Being a Mystery</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:1).</p>
<p>This is a mystery. Are the Word and God one, or are They two? They are both.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord and the Spirit are spoken of as being one because the Lord is the Spirit, but later in the same verse the Spirit of the Lord is mentioned. This indicates that there is an aspect of distinction. Are the Lord and the Spirit one, or are They two? This is a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;But of the Son, &ldquo;&lsquo;Your throne, O God...Therefore, God, Your God, has anointed You&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:8-9).</p>
<p>In verse 8 the Son is called God, but verse 9 speaks of God as being His God. It is not possible to explain this mysterious matter.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Seven Spirits&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</p>
<p>The one Spirit of God in Ephesians 4:4 is called the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation. This is another mystery.</p>
<p>Because the Triune God is a mystery, our limited mentality cannot completely understand the Triune God as a doctrine. The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment. God being triune is for His economy. He is triune to dispense Himself into us and to become our life and our everything. The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
