<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee during a conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, from September 4 through 7, 1963. These messages have not been reviewed by the speaker. </p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE GREAT MATTERS IN THE SCRIPTURES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:11; Gen. 1:26; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S MOVE IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>Before I moved to the United States, I had no thought that I would ever do so. When I visited the United States, I came simply as a visitor with no intention to stay, but while I was here, I carefully observed the situation. One night while I was in San Francisco, I told the brother with whom I was staying that I had the definite sense that the Lord wanted to do something on the West Coast of the United States. After staying with this brother for two or three nights, I left the United States and had no plans to return. My thought was that if the Lord wanted to do something in America, He would surely raise up some saints in America to do this work. After a while, although I still had no thought to move to America, I felt that the Lord was urging me to visit again. Because of this, I came to the United States for a third time. My intention was to stay for three months and then to return to the Far East. When the three months were nearing an end, I made arrangements to visit Taiwan and Manila. Everything was ready for my departure, but the Lord would not allow me to leave. The Lord simply kept me here. This was a great suffering to me. I desired to leave, but the Lord would not allow me to leave. Eventually, I became clear that I had no other choice but to submit myself to the Lord. I told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I have to go along with You. I give up. I will go along with You, and I will stay here.&rdquo; Then I became very clear, and I immediately sent a cable to the Far East, telling the brothers there that I would not be able to return. I also made a call from Seattle, where I was staying at the time, to San Francisco. I told the brother there that I had the burden to visit Sacramento and then to go to Los Angeles. Shortly after this, I visited Sacramento. That was the first time I visited a place without first being invited.</p>
<p>At that time the Lord greatly used two books written by Watchman Nee&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life</em> and <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> Prior to the publication of these two books in America, I visited place after place and saw that the Lord had raised up seeking ones. I also observed that nearly all these seeking ones had been raised up by the Lord in the preceding two to five years. Because the Lord had prepared all these seeking believers, when these two books were published, the hungry Christians devoured their contents. These two books were published at exactly the right time. In fact, <em>The</em><em> Normal Christian Life</em> was published in the very same month that I became clear that the Lord was leading me to stay in America. At that time, in addition to observing the tremendous response to the writings of Watchman Nee, I received letter upon letter and call after call from believers all over the country. These things have confirmed to me that the Lord truly desires to do something wonderful in the United States in these days.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE GREAT MATTERS IN THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>In this message we will consider three great matters in the Scriptures. The first matter is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, God&rsquo;s ultimate intention. God is a divine person with a mind, emotion, and will and is full of wisdom and desire. Thus, in His divine mind there must be a purpose, and this purpose must be both divine and eternal. Ephesians 3:11 says, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; In light of this verse we need to ask, &ldquo;What is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose?&rdquo; The second matter that we will consider in this message is the way that God takes to accomplish His eternal purpose. Once we have seen that God has purposed something according to His own desire, we need to find out how He accomplishes this purpose. The third matter that we will consider is the way in which God applies what He has accomplished to us. First we will consider God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, then we will consider how God accomplishes this purpose, and finally we will examine how the accomplishment of this purpose is applied to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>The entire Bible reveals that in eternity past, according to His own desire, God purposed to do something. He purposed to do one thing&mdash;to gain a group of people who would be His living Body and would express God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a living, corporate Body through which He can express Himself as the Triune God. God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit will be expressed and manifested through a corporate Body composed of human beings.</p>
<p>God is mysterious, infinite, and unlimited, yet He desires to be expressed and manifested. To this end God created man. Man was the last item of God&rsquo;s creation. This indicates that everything that God created prior to creating man was in preparation for man. Once God had made everything ready, He created man. This reveals that man is the center of God&rsquo;s creation. God created man as the center of His creation in a very purposeful way. Man was created in the image of God and committed with God&rsquo;s divine authority over all creation (Gen. 1:26). The fact that man was created in the image of God reveals that man was created to express God, for an image is an expression. For example, if I take a picture of you, the picture will capture your image and will be an expression of you. The fact that man was given authority over all the earth means that man is to be God&rsquo;s representative on the earth. From the way in which God created man, we can see that God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man was that man would express Him and represent Him. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">The Accomplishment of God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>How does God accomplish that which He has purposed? How does God gain a group of people to express and represent Him? God accomplishes His purpose through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. In incarnation God Himself became a man. In so doing He joined and mingled Himself with man. Jesus was a God-man, a man joined and mingled with God. This man lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and then died on the cross. His death was all-inclusive; when He died, everything died with Him (cf. 2 Cor. 5:14). Following His death, He rose from the dead, and in His resurrection He imparted His life into man (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3). In incarnation He brought God into man, and in resurrection He brought man into God (John 14:6, 20). This was the way God accomplished His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Application of the Accomplishment<br />
of God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how this accomplishment is applied to us. The application of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is carried out absolutely in and by the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, following the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Holy Spirit was poured out from the heavens to the earth. This Spirit is all-inclusive. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection are all in this Spirit, who is the realization of Christ. God the Father is embodied in the Son, and God the Son is realized as the Spirit (14:10, 16-20). In this Spirit is everything that we need.</p>
<p>The Spirit takes three steps in applying the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to us: He regenerates us, transforms us, and causes us to realize that we are members of the Body. When we first heard the gospel and received the Lord, the all-inclusive Spirit entered into us and regenerated us (3:6). In regeneration we received God Himself as life into us. This was the beginning of our spiritual life. Regeneration is the first step that the Spirit takes in applying the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose to us. After regenerating us, the Spirit continues to work in us to transform us from our old, human nature into a new, divine nature. This is the second step that the Spirit takes in applying the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to us. The third step that the Spirit takes is to work in us to cause us to realize that we are members of the Body of Christ. The Spirit works in us, demanding that we enter into the Body life, the church life. While the Spirit is transforming us, we will have the realization that we must fellowship with others and have a meeting life. A meeting life is a life of meeting with other Christians. This is the life of the Body. We can never be individual Christians. Instead, we must join ourselves to other believers. This is a demand of the Spirit within us.</p>
 <p>If you meet with the Lord in the morning by yourself, surely the Lord within you will lead you to meet with the saints in the evening. Whenever you go to the Lord, the Lord will send you to the saints. This is because the Lord&rsquo;s desire is to have a built-up Body as His corporate expression. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, His work of transformation in us will be completed, and He will transform even our body into His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). At that time we with all the saints will be a divine, corporate expression, manifesting and expressing God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit. May we all go to the Lord and consider where we are in relation to these three matters&mdash;God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and the application of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can you tell us what kind of spiritual movement you are starting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In response to this question, I would say that we do not want to be a part of any movement. Upon hearing this answer, you may wonder, &ldquo;If Brother Lee is not starting a new movement, then what is he doing?&rdquo; I can only answer you in the following way. God created the heavens, the earth, and man, but man fell. Thus, through incarnation God Himself came to be the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). This man died on the cross to put the entire old creation to an end, and then in resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit so that He could impart His life into all those who believe into Him (v. 45). Those who believe into Him and receive Him as life into their spirit are the Body of Christ. God&rsquo;s desire is that this Body would express God the Father in the Son as the Spirit. This Body is the church (Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18). Wherever they may be on this earth, the believers should come together as the corporate Body of Christ. They should come together to express, exhibit, exalt, and preach Christ. This is the church life.</p>
<p>We know from church history that Satan has done and continues to do many things to damage the Body of Christ and the genuine church life. One of the main things he has done is to bring many foreign things into the church. If you put a nail into your physical body, this foreign item will damage your body and cause it to suffer. This is an illustration of what Satan has done to the Body of Christ. In addition to bringing foreign things into the Body, Satan has done much to divide the Body. Thus, if we consider the condition of today&rsquo;s Christianity, we see these two things&mdash;foreign things and division. The Roman Catholic Church has brought many foreign things into the church, and the Protestant groups have produced a great number of divisions. I once read an article that was written following World War I. The brother who wrote the article said that in 1919 there were more than one thousand five hundred denominations. He also said that at that time there were more than one hundred divisions among the Brethren. That was in 1919. Consider how many more divisions there are today. This is a terrible and wicked situation.</p>
<p>Faced with a situation marked by foreign things and division, what shall we do, and what is the Lord doing? Today the Lord is working to deliver His people from all the damage caused by foreign things and division. We do not want to have any kind of movement; rather, we realize that the Lord is going to deliver us from the negative things, bring us back to the original state of the church, and lead us to have a very simple church life. We must forget about all the foreign things and all the division, and we must practice the church life in a simple and general way. Wherever we are and wherever we go, we should meet together with the saints as a corporate Body to express, experience, exalt, and preach Christ in a simple way. We believe that this is something that the Lord will recover in these last days.</p>
<p><em>Question: Who should be excluded and who should be accepted into the church life? Who would you recommend that we receive into our church life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The only ones who should be excluded are those who are not saved. We must include all the believers. All the regenerated believers are members of the Body of Christ, even those in the Catholic Church. If some from the Catholic Church desire to participate in the church life, we must welcome them. If they do not have this desire, that is their business, and there is nothing that we can do. Our responsibility is to forget about all the foreign things and to forsake division. If someone were to come to me and ask what church I belong to, I would tell him that I simply belong to the church. There is only one church in the entire universe, and I belong to that one church. If they were to ask me what kind of Christian I am, I would say that I am simply a Christian.</p>
<p><em>Question: Some would question the practicality of actually doing this on a local scale. We are all members of the spiritual church, but how can this be carried out in actuality?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In the Scriptures this is very practical. Wherever Christians are, they should come together to practice the meeting life, the assembly life. This is a demand of the Spirit within all believers. If you are in Las Vegas, you should come together with the other believers in Las Vegas. You should not stay home and be a secret Christian. You need to join with others. This is very simple. The problem is that we have become confused by the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. If we were living in the first century and we had received the Lord, I believe it would have been very simple. We would have realized our need to join ourselves with the other Christians around us. Today we should do the same thing. If we live in Los Angeles, we should simply join with the other believers in Los Angeles. The problem today is that when a believer goes to Los Angeles, he does not know where to go, because there is so much confusion. The present situation is confusing, but in principle the church is something simple. It is genuine, divine, eternal, heavenly, spiritual, and of the Lord. Today if we want to realize the church life, we need to rid ourselves of all the foreign things in Christianity, forsake all the divisions, and be simple, general Christians, coming together in the place where we are, to worship God in Christ through the Spirit and to experience, exalt, exhibit, express, and preach Christ.</p>
<p><em>Question: It does not seem easy to find a group of believers whose desire to grow spiritually is strong enough that they are willing to take this way. What does it take for a believer to be brought to the point where he has the desire to take this way?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This relates to the third great matter that we considered earlier in this message&mdash;the application of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The question you are asking relates to how we can apply what Christ has accomplished. When we meet an unbeliever, we need to preach the gospel to him. This is clear to all of us. However, what should we do when we meet believers? When we meet a group of Christians who have been regenerated by the Lord and we realize that they do not have much realization of spiritual matters, we need to help them. First of all we need to help them to be impressed with the love of Christ. For this we need to pray much. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I need these saints. I realize that they are genuine brothers and sisters in Christ. However, I also realize that although they have been regenerated, they do not love You very much. Work in them and cause them to love You more.&rdquo; In addition to praying for these believers, we need to fellowship with them to stir up their hearts to love the Lord more. If they would begin to love the Lord more and would offer themselves to the Lord, the Spirit would have the ground within them and would be able to work in them and cause them to desire to take this way.</p>
<p>If we have the desire to realize the genuine church life, we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord again. We should go to the Lord and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, cause me to love You more.&rdquo; Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #368 says, &ldquo;More love to Thee, O Lord, / More love to Thee! / Hear Thou the prayer I make / On bended knee; / This is my earnest plea: / More love, O Lord, to Thee, / More love to Thee, / More love to Thee!&rdquo; We need to love the Lord more, and we need to help others to love and seek the Lord more. Then the Holy Spirit will have the ground in us to bring us on and to apply to us everything that God has accomplished for His eternal purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO CONTACT THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 9:23; John 6:51; 7:37-38; 2 Cor. 13:14; Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 15:45; John 20:22; 2 Cor. 3:17; John 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAN CREATED AS A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s central thought and eternal intention is to work Himself into us to become life to us and even to become everything to us. To accomplish this intention, God created man as a vessel (Rom. 9:23). A vessel is made for the purpose of containing something. Thus, in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was created, a vessel must be filled with something. Since man was created as a vessel, we need to consider what man was made to contain. With what was man meant to be filled? Man was made to contain God. We are containers of God, and God must be our content. This is why human beings often have a sense of emptiness within. We feel empty because we were made to contain God, and if we do not have God within us, we are merely empty vessels. This is why we need to believe in the Lord Jesus. To believe in the Lord Jesus is not merely to believe that He is our Savior; to believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into our spirit (John 1:12; 2 Tim. 4:22). When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God in Christ as the Spirit enters into our spirit and begins to dwell within us. We are containers, and the Triune God&mdash;the Father in the Son as the Spirit&mdash;is the content within us. As the content within us, the Triune God wants to fill us with Himself in order to become our life and everything. When we are completely filled with God in this way, God will be our content, and we will be satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH GOD<br />
BY EATING AND DRINKING HIM</h2>
<p>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him into us, we can be filled with Him by eating and drinking Him. The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord is the heavenly bread for us to feed upon and the living water for us to drink (6:51; 7:37-38). Matthew 4:4 also tells us that we should not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God. God&rsquo;s word is the expression of God Himself. Thus, to take in God&rsquo;s word is to take in God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE<br />
SO THAT WE CAN PARTAKE OF HIM</h2>
<p>We who have believed in the Lord Jesus have the Lord dwelling within us (Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5). Since we have received the Lord into us, the question is, &ldquo;How do we partake of the Lord day by day and moment by moment as our food, drink, and life supply?&rdquo; This is the question that we will address in this message. This question is mysterious, divine, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal, yet the answer is actually quite simple. To understand the way for us to unceasingly partake of the Lord as our food, drink, and life supply, we must see that God is triune.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14), yet this does not mean that there are three Gods. There is only one God (1 Cor. 8:4), yet this one God is three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. He is the Triune God. We can see the matter of the Triune God in Matthew 28:19, which says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s charge to us is that we would disciple all the nations. Concerning those among the nations who receive the Lord, the Lord instructed us to baptize them into &ldquo;the name.&rdquo; The Lord did not use the plural form of the word <em>name,</em> saying that we should baptize the nations into the names; instead, He used the singular form, <em>name.</em> The three of the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;have one name. They are three, yet They have only one name. This indicates clearly that God is triune.</p>
<p>In a limited way, water is a helpful illustration of the Divine Trinity. Suppose we have a large piece of ice. Ice is very solid. Suppose, however, that we leave the ice in the sun for an hour. If we do this, after an hour the ice will melt and become water. Furthermore, suppose we leave the water outside for an entire day. If we do this, at the end of the day the water will be gone. After a day in the sun, the water will turn into vapor. Over the course of the day, we will have ice, then water, and then vapor, but can we say that these are three different items? We cannot say this, because the ice, water, and vapor are the same substance in three distinct forms.</p>
<p>We can apply this illustration to our partaking of the Triune God. If you have a large chunk of ice, it would be very difficult to take it into you. If you allow the ice to melt and become water, it will be easier for you to take it in. If you allow the water to become vapor, it will be even easier to take it into you. When water becomes vapor, you can very easily breathe it into you. Thus, we can say that in order for us to partake of the water, it has to pass through three steps. First, it is ice; second, it is water; and third, it is vapor. Similarly, our God has passed through a process of three steps in order to make Himself available for us to partake of Him and receive Him into us. In the first step God the Father is the fountain, the source, of the Divine Trinity (cf. Psa. 36:9; Jer. 2:13). In the second step God the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God (Col. 2:9; John 1:18). Through incarnation the Son as the complete Triune God became flesh (1:1, 14) in order to bring God into man and to accomplish our redemption through His crucifixion on the cross. In the third step God the Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father (14:16-20, 10). In His resurrection the Son as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit to be the consummation of the processed Triune God (1 Cor. 15:45). This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is like water vapor, and we can breathe Him in (John 20:22).</p>
<p>Because the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), our partaking of Him is not limited by time or space. Wherever we are and whenever we desire, we can simply breathe Him in. All we need to do is to &ldquo;tune&rdquo; our heart and our spirit to Him. I use the word <em>tune</em> because the Spirit can also be likened to the radio waves in the air. Whenever we tune our heart and spirit to Him, we have the sense that we are being touched within. The Holy Spirit comes and touches our heart. We all need to have this experience. When we repent, confess our sins, sincerely turn our heart to the Lord, and believe in Him, we sense that we are being touched within and that something is moving within us. This is the moving of the Spirit within us.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like the vapor in the illustration of the ice, the water, and the vapor. In this regard, we can say that the Spirit is the last &ldquo;form&rdquo; of the Triune God. He is the consummation of the Triune God, and today it is easy for us to breathe Him in. When we tune our heart to Him, He comes into our spirit, and we have the sense that we have been touched within. At times we even sense that there is a speaking within us. This speaking comes not from outside of us but from within us. This speaking is the divine visitation of the Triune God. God the Father comes to us in God the Son as God the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH, CONTACT, AND ENJOY<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>It is wonderful that we have this divine person dwelling within us. The very Triune God of this universe is within us, and He will never leave us. The question now is how to deal with Him. How do we deal with, contact, and enjoy this wonderful One who is dwelling within us? How do we take Him as our life and everything in a practical way in our daily life? The Triune God being within us is not a matter of doctrine; it is very real and practical. Thus, we must consider how we should deal with, contact, and enjoy Him within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Loving Him</h2>
<p>The first thing we must do is love the Lord. In the Gospel of John the Lord did not ask us to do many outward things. Rather, He asked us to do two things&mdash;to believe into Him and to love Him. After He had risen from the dead, the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; Then the Lord asked Peter two more times, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&rdquo; (21:15-17). I believe that the Lord is asking us this question today. Do we love the Lord? It is a pity if we do not love Him. We all must love the Lord. I believe that within every believer there is a longing to love the Lord. Even backsliding believers have this longing and have some love for the Lord within them. We all have such a longing and such a love in our heart. Our love for the Lord may be very small, but even though we may have only a little love for Him in our heart, this is sufficient. This small amount of love is like a seed that will eventually grow. All of us must love the Lord. I have traveled to many places on this earth, and I have observed that every Christian has something within him that is calling and even demanding that he love the Lord. Each of us has such a sense within&mdash;something urging and demanding that we love the Lord. We must take care of this feeling and respond to this inner voice. We need to answer this call and tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I must love You, and I do love You, but my love for You is very small. Cause me to love You more.&rdquo; We all must pray to the Lord concerning our love for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecrating Ourselves to Him</h2>
<p>In addition to loving the Lord, we must consecrate ourselves to Him. At least once in our life we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord in a definite way. We all must pass through this crisis. If we have never consecrated ourselves to the Lord in a definite way, we must do so now. We must go to the Lord and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I have been bought by You. You have purchased me with Your precious blood, and I have been ransomed and redeemed by You. Lord, I am Yours. I belong to You, so I hand myself over to You. Because I love You, I offer myself to You.&rdquo; Many of us might have done this before, but if some years have passed since the last time we consecrated ourselves to the Lord, we must do it again; we must renew our consecration. After we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, the Lord will have the ground to operate in us. The Lord will have the ground within us, and He will begin to move and speak in us. In addition, we will have the ground to contact the Lord and to enter into fellowship with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reading and Praying the Word in Spirit</h2>
<p>In addition to loving the Lord and consecrating ourselves to Him, we must spend time in His Word. Every morning we must open His Word. We do not need to read too much; we should simply open the Word and read it with our heart and our spirit. We may know how to read the Word with our mind, and we may even know how to read the Word with our heart, but do we know how to read the Word with our spirit? Second Corinthians 3:17 states that the Lord is the Spirit, and John 6:63 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. To read the Word with our spirit means that when we come to the Word, we need to contact it with the innermost part of our being. We must contact the Word with the deepest part of our being, and we must not merely understand the Word but sense the Word. We must not only understand the Word with our mind and love it with our heart; we must also sense it with our spirit. There is a great difference between reading the Word and reading the newspaper. To read the newspaper, we only need to use our eyes to see the words and our mind to understand them. To properly read the Word, however, requires something more. To properly read the Word, we also need to use our heart to love the Word and our spirit to contact and sense the Word.</p>
<p>This matter of sensing the Word may be unfamiliar to many. Some may wonder what this means and how we can use our spirit to sense the Word. To sense the Word with our spirit requires us not only to read the Word but also to pray over the Word. After reading a verse or two, we need to spend some time to pray with the verses and concerning the verses. For example, suppose we read Luke 18:19, which says, &ldquo;But Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One&mdash;God.&rdquo; After reading this verse, we need to pray about it. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, Your Word says that no one is good. Thus, I am not good. No one is good except God Himself. Lord, I do praise You. You are the only One who is good. There is nothing within me that is good.&rdquo; After praying in this way, we may continue to pray, &ldquo;Lord, since there is no good in me, please save me from trusting in myself, and teach me how to enjoy You and trust in You. You are the only One who is good.&rdquo; By praying with the Word and concerning the Word in this way, we exercise our spirit, and by exercising our spirit in this way, we contact the Lord in the Word. Instead of merely reading the Word with our mind, we can exercise our spirit by praying over the Word. We can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, no one in this universe is good except One&mdash;God. God is the only One who is good.&rdquo; Of course, we need to understand what this verse means, but even more we need to exercise our heart to love this verse and our spirit to contact the Lord in this verse. We should immediately turn our reading into prayer, praying, &ldquo;Lord, this is so wonderful. No one is good, not even me. Only You are good. Lord, I thank You that You are the only One who is good. Cause me to realize that I am not good and that there is nothing within me that is good. Save me from having any confidence in myself and from trusting in myself. Teach me to trust in You, to take You as my life, and to live by You. You are the only One who is good.&rdquo; This is the way to come to the Word&mdash;to turn all our reading into praying. By doing this, we exercise our spirit and contact the Lord in the Word. This is the simplest and most effective way to read the Word.</p>
<p>Every believer should read through the whole Bible in a quick way at least once so as to get an overview. Then, after reading quickly, he should go back and digest every verse in a slow way, verse by verse. The first kind of reading can be likened to going to the supermarket, purchasing a great amount of food, and bringing the food home and storing it. The second kind of reading can be likened to cooking and eating the food little by little every day. Every day we should eat a little food at breakfast, a little at lunch, and a little at dinner. In like manner, every day we need to take a little of the Word into us. If possible, we should rise up every morning and spend some time to contact the Lord by reading His Word in a living way. Every day we should spend ten minutes to come to the Lord early in the morning. In those ten minutes we do not need to read too many verses, nor do we need to think too much about what we are reading. Instead, we should simply read a few verses and pray over them. By taking a little of the Word into us every day, the Word of God will be our food, and we will live by it.</p>
<p>If we pray over the Word every day, we will sense the presence of the Lord and the anointing of the Holy Spirit. In addition, we will learn how to pray from our spirit. In the past we may have prayed solely from our memory or from our mind, but by praying over a few verses every day, we will learn to pray from our spirit. To pray from our spirit is to pray from our inner sense. Instead of merely praying what we have memorized or what we are thinking, we pray according to the sense that is within us. We can illustrate this in the following way. Suppose a certain brother&rsquo;s mother becomes sick. This brother may be concerned about his mother, but when he comes to contact the Lord, he should forget about his mother&rsquo;s sickness. He should forget about everything and simply come to the Lord, praying to the Lord not according to what is in his mind but by using the Word and by praying according to his deep inner sense. He should pray according to his inner feeling, not according to his memory. If he does this, the more he prays, the more he will sense the presence of the Lord. Eventually, while he is in the presence of the Lord, the Lord within him will remind him to pray for his mother. Then, when this brother prays for his mother, his prayer will not be out of his self but out of the Lord who is within him.</p>
<p>By reading the Word and praying to the Lord in this way, we can contact the Lord and be contacted by Him. The Lord can speak many things to us, bring us into His presence, enlighten us, and show us all our weaknesses, faults, and defilements. When He shows us these things, we must confess to Him. Then He will cleanse us with His precious blood and purge our conscience, making it bright and pure. As a result, our conscience will be fully at peace, and our spirit will be living and prevailing. Consequently, we will have the living anointing within us all day long. We will be able to fellowship and converse with the Lord continually, and as we do this, gradually we will be filled with the Lord until our whole being is full of the Holy Spirit. This is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>The sisters know that the best way to cause their children to grow is to feed them. We Christians also grow by feeding. We grow by feeding on the Lord, and we feed on the Lord by reading the Word in a living way and by praying to the Lord with the Word. This is absolutely not a matter of doctrine. If we take this matter as a doctrine, it will not benefit us. Rather than being a doctrine, this word is a direction for us to take and practice. We all should endeavor to practice. Every morning we should try our best to rise up fifteen minutes earlier than we usually do. Then we can use these fifteen minutes to spend some time with the Lord and to read His Word. We can read at least one or two verses and at most nine or ten verses. We can read in a silent way with a sincere heart and pray about what we read. In fact, we can even pray with what we read. Then we should spend some time to pray in a prevailing way according to our inner sense. If we follow these instructions, we will genuinely contact the Lord. It would be wonderful if we had more time, but we should spend at least fifteen minutes to read the Word and pray to the Lord in this way.</p>
<p>If we spend fifteen minutes every morning to contact the Lord in this way, there will be many results. We will experience the infilling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and spiritual gifts, light, life, and power will flow out of us. When children eat well, they experience change and growth every day. However, Christians today remain the same because they are starving spiritually. The majority of Christians merely come to &ldquo;church&rdquo; and sit in the congregation as &ldquo;pew members.&rdquo; From time to time they have the opportunity to pray a little. When they do, they pray according to their environment, situation, and circumstances, or solely from their memory or natural mentality. Most Christians simply do not know how to exercise their spirit. Even when they read the Word, they exercise only their mind, and the result is that they have many peculiar thoughts. The goal of our reading of the Word, however, is not to receive peculiar thoughts but to contact the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Spirit, and the Lord is in His Word. Thus, when we pray and read the Word, we do so not to receive knowledge, doctrines, and teachings but to contact the Lord and to be fed by Him. We need to feed on the Lord through the Word and to contact the Lord through prevailing prayer. Then the Lord will speak to us, reveal Himself to us, and bring us into the light, exposing to us our real condition. Then we will know the Lord and ourselves in a real way. We will also experience the Lord, enjoy the Lord, and be filled with Him. This will cause us to grow and will release many positive blessings. If we spend fifteen minutes every day to read the Word and contact the Lord, after a few weeks even the meetings of the church will be changed. They will become rich, powerful, strong, and living, and in such an atmosphere many sinners will be brought to the Lord. The secret, the key, to all these wonderful things is to contact the Lord through reading the Word and praying in a prevailing way.</p>
<p>In some places that I visit, I ask the brothers to sign their names on a piece of paper, promising that they will spend fifteen minutes with the Lord in the morning. After the brothers who are willing sign this piece of paper, I keep it, and after two weeks I write a letter to each brother asking him whether or not he has kept his promise. Often, brothers have written me back, telling me how wonderful their experience has been. I hope that all of us will make such a decision to spend time with the Lord in the morning to read His Word and to pray to Him in a prevailing way. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, so starting tomorrow I will try to learn to rise up a little earlier in the morning to spend some time with You to read Your Word and to pray in a living, new way.&rdquo; May we all endeavor to enter into this practice.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is there some significance to spending this time with the Lord in the morning? Is there a particular reason that you mention the morning?</em></p>
<p>Answer: All of our environments and circumstances are different; therefore, for some saints it is very difficult to have this time in the morning. If this is the case, you should spend this time with the Lord in the evening. It is better to do it in the evening than not at all. There is, however, a reason that I encourage you to have this time in the morning. In the morning everything is fresh and new. In the evening after working the whole day, you may be tired, so it may be difficult to contact the Lord in a fresh and living way. Someone once asked George M&uuml;ller why it is necessary to spend time with the Lord in the morning. M&uuml;ller answered that in the Old Testament the children of Israel were instructed to offer the fat of the sacrifice to the Lord and not the dung (Exo. 29:13-14; Lev. 4:8-12). M&uuml;ller went on to say that spending time with the Lord late in the evening is like offering the dung to the Lord, but spending time with the Lord in the morning is like offering the Lord the fat. This is because the morning time is the best time. In the Old Testament the children of Israel had to collect manna every day during the time that they were in the wilderness. When did Jehovah tell them to collect the manna? He told them to do so in the morning. The entire Bible is also filled with examples of the Lord&rsquo;s seekers rising early to contact Him (Gen. 19:27; 21:14; 22:3; 28:18; Exo. 8:20; 9:13; 24:4; 34:4; Josh. 3:1; 6:12; 7:16; 8:10; Judg. 6:38; 1 Sam. 1:19; 15:12; 17:20; Job 1:5; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:22; John 20:1; Acts 5:21).</p>
<p>In the past years in the Far East, we have strongly emphasized our need to spend time with the Lord in the morning. We call this the &ldquo;morning watch.&rdquo; Every Christian should rise up early in the morning to keep the morning watch, spending time with the Lord by reading the Word and praying. If we do this, the Lord will speak to each one of us, and the churches where we are will be greatly improved.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is the Lord waiting for us to take action, or should we wait for the Lord to take action?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must realize that the Lord has been waiting for us for generations. Thus, if we realize that we are vessels and that the Lord desires to fill us with Himself, we should take action to contact Him. The Lord wants to fill us with Himself, but we need to cooperate with the Lord. The way that we do this is by loving Him, consecrating ourselves to Him, and contacting Him in His Word every day. The best time for us to do this is early in the morning. If we do this, we will grow in the Lord in a very quick way.</p>
<p>During the first seven years of my Christian life, I did not make any improvement. I went to Christian meetings five times a week&mdash;in the morning, afternoon, and evening on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and in the evening on Tuesdays and Thursdays&mdash;and I studied the Scriptures diligently with my mind. Yet during those seven years I did not make any improvement. Then, after seven years of no improvement, in one year I improved a great deal. How did this happen? This happened because in the eighth year I was helped to learn how to contact the Lord in a living way by reading the Word prayerfully and praying to the Lord in a prevailing way. When I learned how to do this, the Lord began to speak many things to me. He touched me, purged me, cleansed me, transformed me, and called me. It was also in that year that the Lord raised me up to begin to speak for Him. This was how my service in the ministry began. According to the Lord&rsquo;s grace, I can testify that I never attended a Bible school, nor was I taught by a minister or preacher. Instead, one day I was helped by the Lord&rsquo;s children to learn how to contact the Lord in a living way. Many spiritual things have issued from contacting the Lord in this way. Thus, I have the assurance that if the saints will practice to contact the Lord in this living way, many blessings will result. There will be gifts, power, strength, preaching, edifying, and light. Moreover, this will produce the genuine church life. The Lord is living, real, and available, and He is waiting for us to enjoy Him, receive Him, and experience Him.</p>
<p><em>Question: When you spend time with the Lord in the morning, do you simply pray according to what you feel, and is it possible to have this time without reading the Bible?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When you come to the Lord in the morning, you should do two things&mdash;read and pray. It is possible to spend time with the Lord without reading the Bible, but it is better to do some reading. You should read a few verses and then try to pray concerning them according to your understanding of them. If you do not understand what the verses are saying, you should not be bothered. If you understand the verses, you can pray over them, but if not, you can simply pass over the verses and go on to the next verses. Perhaps when you come to these verses again after two years, you will understand them and will be able to pray over them. Do not try to understand. If you have some understanding concerning the verses you read, take the verses and pray over them; if you do not have any understanding, simply continue reading. If you practice to pray while you are reading, this will nourish your spirit. Learn to pray while you are reading and to read while you are praying.</p>
<p>We must also learn to pray from our innermost part. We should not pray in a shallow, superficial way but in a deep way from the deepest part of our being. If we pray in this way while reading the Word, we will contact and enjoy the Lord. He will be our life supply, and we will feed on Him. Before you go to work, you eat breakfast, and the food that you eat in the morning energizes you and enables you to live during the day. This is something physical. In like manner, we need to eat spiritual food to energize our spirit and to cause us to grow spiritually.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is the ability to be mingled with God limited to only a few believers?</em></p>
<p>Answer: No, it is not. It is for everyone. I have seen thousands of believers meeting together and enjoying the Lord in this way. Even those who are unlearned have been &ldquo;burned&rdquo; by the Lord and used by the Lord to bring many sinners to Him. They have even become leading, functioning members in the church. As long as we contact the Lord in this way morning by morning, the Lord will burn us and set us on fire. Before we can use an iron to press our clothes, we must plug the iron into an electrical outlet. When the iron is plugged in, the electricity &ldquo;burns&rdquo; the iron. In like manner, every morning we need to get &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; into the Lord by contacting Him.</p>
<p><em>Question: Romans 8:26 says, &ldquo;Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&rdquo; Is this the kind of prayer of which you are speaking?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, sometimes this is the only way that we can pray. Sometimes we have a sense or a burden deep within us, yet we do not know how to utter it. In this situation we just groan, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord.&rdquo; This is the most prevailing kind of prayer. The more we groan in this way, the more we sense the anointing within us. This is to pray unutterable prayers from our spirit.</p>
<p><em>Question: Do you find that it is easier today for you to contact the Lord than it was years ago?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The way that I am describing to you is the easiest way to contact the Lord; there is no easier way. Of course, after practicing this way for a while, you will get used to it, and it will become your habit. Then you will be able to contact the Lord in this way even while you are driving or at work. If the sisters practice to contact the Lord in this way in the morning, eventually they will be able to contact the Lord in this way while they are taking care of their household affairs or while they are cooking in the kitchen. The main need of Christians today is to contact the Lord in a living way. If you ask me what has kept me pursuing and serving the Lord, I would say that it is this one matter&mdash;contacting the Lord in a living way by reading and praying over His Word.</p>
<p>Today we need to cooperate with the Lord and give Him an opportunity to be everything to us. The Lord is like the air that we breathe. There is fresh air all around us, but we must exercise our lungs to breathe in this air. When we cooperate with the air by breathing it in, we allow the air to become our portion. Similarly, we need to exercise our being to contact the Lord in a living way so that He can become everything to us.</p>
<p>Our Lord is not a doctrine or a teaching, and the Christian life is not a matter of doctrine and teaching. Our Lord is a living person, and this living person is the Christian life. Christ is living, real, rich, infinite, and available, yet He needs us to cooperate, enjoy, take, and experience Him. If we do this, many things will happen. If you allow the Lord to burn you, all your neighbors will be burned. There will be a fire in your neighborhood, and perhaps one of your neighbors will become a genuine Peter&mdash;one who will be used by the Lord to bring one thousand people to the Lord.</p>
<p>I have the deep sense that many of the Lord&rsquo;s children are good brothers and sisters with sincere hearts for the Lord, but I also sense that they have a great need. They do not need to be taught more doctrine. This does not work. The one thing that they need is to take this word and to practice contacting the living Lord every day. If the believers in a certain place would practice to contact the Lord in this way every morning and then would come together in the evening and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to express, exalt, and exhibit the Christ whom they have experienced, they would become a most wonderful church. We must contact the Lord in the morning and then come together in the evening and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to fellowship with one another and to share the Christ whom we have experienced as an exhibition and a testimony to the whole universe. We must also preach to our neighbors the very Christ whom we experience and exalt. If we do all these things, the result will be wonderful. The disciples who were used by the Lord on the day of Pentecost were merely Galilean fisherman. They were small, unlearned people, yet the Lord used them. Why did the Lord use them? He used them because they contacted Him in a prevailing way and gave Him a free way to move through them. This is what we need today. We do not need more teaching; the Lord Himself will be our living teaching, our living message. He will speak in us in a living way, and then we will be able to speak for Him. We need to enter into the real Christian life, which is a life of contacting the Lord in His Word and of giving Him the freedom to move through us. May the Lord bring us all into such a life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
AND TO BECOME<br />
GENUINE SPIRITUAL MEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A GENUINE CHRISTIAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Merely a Good Man or a Religious Man</h2>
<p>All human beings have the tendency to try to be good. Even sinful people often have the thought that they should try to be good. In addition to trying to be good, some people feel the need to be religious. Being religious is going a step further than simply trying to be good. It is possible to try to live a good life without having any consideration concerning God. Throughout history there have been many people like this. Although these people had nothing to do with God, they appeared to be good people. Whether or not they were truly good is another question, but to those around them they appeared to be good. On the other hand, people who are religious consider God. They fear God, worship God, and endeavor to live and walk according to the will of God. Many of these religious people become Christians, thinking that to be a Christian is to be one who fears God, worships God, and attempts to live and walk according to God&rsquo;s will. Is this concept correct? Is this what it means to be a Christian? Surely, as Christians we must be good. Moreover, no one can dispute the fact that true Christians fear God, worship God, and seek to live and walk according to God&rsquo;s will. Nevertheless, we must see that being a Christian is much more than this. Being a Christian is more than merely being a good or religious person.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Christ-man&mdash;One Who Is Filled with Christ</h2>
<p>To be a Christian is to be a spiritual person. What does it mean to be spiritual, and what is the difference between being spiritual and being good or religious? To be spiritual is to be mingled and filled with Christ. Thus, a true Christian is a person who is mingled and filled with Christ. The word <em>Christian</em> means &ldquo;an adherent of Christ.&rdquo; A genuine adherent or follower of Christ is a man of Christ, a Christ-man, one who is filled with Christ.</p>
<p>A cup of tea is a good illustration of what it means to be a Christ-man. A cup of tea is not composed solely of tea; it is tea that has been mingled with water. It is neither merely water nor merely tea; it is tea plus water, water plus tea. Thus, we can call it &ldquo;tea-water.&rdquo; Human beings are like a cup of water, and Christ is like tea. When Christ as the tea enters into us as the water, He is mingled together with us, making us Christ-men. A true Christian is a Christ-man&mdash;one who has been mingled with Christ and has Christ as his life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Spiritual Man&mdash;<br />
One Who Is Filled with the Spirit</h2>
<p>To be spiritual is also to be one who is filled with the Spirit, for the Spirit is the reality of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit (1 John 5:6; John 16:12-15; 1 Cor. 15:45b). If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have Christ, because Christ is the Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 clearly states, &ldquo;And the Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Furthermore, Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse reveals that we are of Christ because we have the Spirit of Christ. Thus, if we do not have the Spirit of Christ, we do not belong to Christ. We can never divide the Spirit from Christ, because Christ and the Spirit are one. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are not three separate Gods. They are one God who is three-one. Just as the Triune God is one, Christ and the Spirit are also one. Thus, if you have the Spirit, you have Christ. This makes you a Christ-man&mdash;a man who is mingled and filled with Christ. Furthermore, a Christ-man is a Spirit-man&mdash;a man who is mingled and filled with the Spirit of Christ. This is what it means to be a Christian. A Christian is not a good man or a religious man; a Christian is a spiritual man, a man mingled and filled with Christ as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCES AMONG BEING A GOOD MAN,<br />
A RELIGIOUS MAN, AND A SPIRITUAL MAN</h2>
<p>Suppose there is a man who does not believe in God. He does not love God, fear God, worship God, or have any consideration for God. However, because he is a human being, this man feels that he should be a good person. He feels that he should try to love his neighbors and that he should be good toward others. This is the kind of person that we would call a good man. However, suppose that one day this good man begins to realize that in this universe there is an almighty Being, a God. With this realization, he begins to fear, love, and worship God. Eventually, this man hears that he is a sinner before God and that God sent His Son, the Lord Jesus, to die on the cross to redeem man. As a result, this man believes that Jesus is the Savior, repents to God, and is saved. He then begins to attend Christian meetings and to endeavor to live according to God&rsquo;s will. In addition, he begins to study the Bible and to read many Christian devotionals and religious writings. He even begins to collect sermons and to practice delivering sermons. He also learns how to compose prayers, and when he comes to the meetings, he offers to God the prayers that he has composed and delivers to the congregation the sermons that he has prepared, reading from his notes. The question now is what kind of man he has become. Previously, he was a good man&mdash;a man who attempted to do good apart from God&mdash;but now what kind of man is he? Surely he has become something more than a good man, but can we say that he is a spiritual man? We cannot. This man has become a religious man, but it is doubtful that he has become a spiritual man. From this we can see that it is very possible to become a religious person without becoming a truly spiritual person.</p>
<p>Suppose that one day the Lord comes to this brother and brings him into His light. As a result, the way this brother prays begins to change. Rather than praying from his memory, from his mind, or according to his circumstances, he begins to pray according to what he senses in his innermost being, and his prayer often comes out in broken sentences. He prays, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord, I am sinful. Lord, how sinful! Lord, forgive me. Oh, forgive me. I am sinful.&rdquo; Then this brother fully gives himself up to the Lord, and the Spirit has the way to possess, occupy, and fill him. As a result, when this brother comes to the church meetings, he is filled with the Spirit, and there is something energizing, burning, and bubbling within him. He cannot control it; neither can he quench it. When the opportunity arises in the meeting, he offers prayers in a living way. Although his prayers are not grammatically correct like the prayers that he used to compose, he prays from his spirit, and a living stream flows out from within him. All the brothers and sisters in the meeting sense the presence and anointing of the Lord in his prayers. When the opportunity arises for this brother to give a short word in the meeting, he stands up and speaks from his spirit. Previously, he shared from his prepared notes; now he shares from the burning, energizing, strengthening, and bubbling within him, testifying to the congregation of the living One who lives within Him. What kind of person is this man? Clearly he has become a spiritual person&mdash;a person filled with Christ as the Spirit. He is not merely a good man or a religious man; he is much more than this. He has become a spiritual man, a man who is according to God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is that we would be spiritual, that is, that we would be filled, occupied, and saturated with Christ. Only when we are spiritual can we be living and functioning. If we are not spiritual, we may be good and religious, but we will be dead. It is possible to be a good Christian and a religious Christian and at the same time be a dead Christian. A dead Christian has no living impact, no genuine spiritual gift, and no power or authority. All he has is religious knowledge and Christian teachings. This is why we need to be filled and saturated with the Spirit. When we are filled and saturated with the Spirit, we become genuine spiritual men.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
AND TO BECOME GENUINE SPIRITUAL MEN&mdash;CONTACTING THE LORD<br />
IN A DEFINITE AND PREVAILING WAY</h2>
<p>Since our need today is to be filled and saturated with the Spirit, we must consider what we need to do in order to experience the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s Word reveals that on God&rsquo;s side everything is ready. God is ready and is waiting for us. We need to do something, but what is it that we need to do? The first thing we must do is to go to the Lord. To do this we need to learn how to contact the Lord in a definite and prevailing way. I am afraid that many believers have been praying for a number of years and have spent much time reading the Word but have never contacted the Lord in a definite and prevailing way. Thus, we need to consider at length how to contact the Lord in this way.</p>
<p>I was born into a semi-Christian family. My family was about fifty percent Christian and fifty percent Buddhist. At a young age I began to study at Christian schools and was thereby brought into the realm of Christianity. I was exposed to Christianity, but I was not saved. In fact, I did not like Christianity at all. When I was nineteen years old, I heard an announcement that a young, twenty-five year old lady was coming to my town to hold a public gospel campaign. This surprised me greatly, and I decided that I would go to one of the meetings to see what it was all about. At the first meeting the Lord met me. I went to the meeting not to see the Lord but to see if anything strange would happen there, but when I got there, the Lord met me, and I was saved. In fact, I was saved in a prevailing way.</p>
<p>After receiving the Lord, I thought that I needed to begin to behave like a Christian. In my mind this meant that I needed to be good and religious. With this concept, I began to read and study the Scriptures, and I also sought out a place where I could obtain the best knowledge concerning the Scriptures. After finding such a place, I studied the Bible and learned the Scriptures there for seven years. Day after day and week after week I prayed and attended the meetings, but within I was dead.</p>
<p>One day in August 1931 the Lord spoke within me. He asked me, &ldquo;What are you doing here? Are you living or dead? What kind of Christian are you?&rdquo; This was a real crisis for me. The very next day I went up to a little mountain close to my home to pray. I went there early in the morning and knelt down and cried out to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me! There must be something wrong with me. Week after week I attend Christian meetings, study the Word, and pray, but I am still so dead and weak, and for many years I have not brought one soul to You.&rdquo; When I cried out in this way, the Holy Spirit flooded through me like a mighty tide. I realized that I was sinful, dirty, and rebellious. I cannot describe how I felt at that time. I simply prostrated myself on the ground and told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am sinful. I am the most sinful person in the whole world.&rdquo; As I confessed to the Lord in this way, tears came down my face. Later, as I was on my way down the mountain, I was filled with happiness, joy, peace, and a heavenly feeling. At that time I did not know where I was. I could not tell if I was in the heavens or on the earth.</p>
<p>From that day on, for more than seven months I rose up early every morning and went up to that mountain. Day by day I went up to the mountain to pray to the Lord in a living way. During this time it was easy for me to meet the Lord. I would read the Word, pray, and call upon the Lord in a living way. Sometimes when I would call upon the Lord, I had to stop calling because tears would be pouring down my face. For seven months I went up to the mountain by myself to pray in this way. I was just a young person at the time, and no one could understand me. My family thought that there was something wrong with me and even wondered whether something had happened to my mind. They realized that there had been a great change in my life. After seven months of praying in this way, I learned the difference between being religious and being spiritual, between reading the Scriptures with the mind and reading the living Word of God with the spirit.</p>
<p>After seven months of praying to the Lord every morning on the mountain, something else very wonderful happened&mdash;the Lord began His ministry through me. A few years before that time the pastor of our denomination had asked me to give a sermon on the Lord&rsquo;s Day during the morning service. I was only around twenty-three years old at the time. For an entire week before that day on which I was to give the sermon, I worked on my sermon. I wrote down notes concerning all the points on which I would speak, and when the time came for me to give my sermon, I spoke from the platform according to the notes that I had prepared. Although I had written everything down, I still missed several points that I had intended to cover. Years later, when the Lord began to use me to minister for Him and opened the way for me to begin speaking for Him, my first thought was to write down all my points on a piece of paper as I had done before. Initially, I tried to do this, but eventually, I found out that this way does not work. Once I discovered this, I dropped this way and simply began to speak from my spirit. At that time I learned that there are two ways to speak. One way is to speak from memory, from the mind, which does not work. The other way is to speak from the spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is that all His people would be genuinely spiritual. However, in order for us to become spiritual, we all need to have at least one time when we come to the Lord and are met by Him in a definite way. We must come to the Lord in a definite, purposeful way, not to pray for various things but to meet the Lord and to be met by Him. We must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, here I am. I am ready to be searched by You. I am ready for You to meet me, break me, and speak to me. I am ready. Lord, here I am.&rdquo; We all need to go to the Lord and have such a time with Him at least once in our life.</p>
<p>Thus far we have considered our need to spend time with the Lord in the morning to practice contacting Him in a living way by reading His Word and praying in a prevailing way. We all need to do this, and it is absolutely right for us to do this. However, in order for our morning time with the Lord to be successful, we must first do one thing. We must go to the Lord to have a definite time in which we allow Him to search us, enlighten us, and meet us. We must go to the Lord in a purposeful and definite way to have such a time. We have no choice, and we cannot argue when it comes to this matter. If we desire to be normal, living, and spiritual Christians, we must go to the Lord in this way. If we do this and are met by the Lord in a definite way, what will be the result? The result will be that we will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and there will be a great change in our life. We will realize that to be a Christian is to be in the spirit and that the Christian life is absolutely a matter in the spirit.</p>
<p>All genuine believers have been regenerated, and all true Christians have the Spirit within them. However, most believers have never been truly filled with the Spirit. They have not been occupied, possessed, and saturated with the Spirit. This is our great need. Christians today, especially those in America, do not need more teachings or doctrines. They already have plenty of both. The primary need of Christians today is to be filled and saturated with the Spirit in a living way. The reason many believers are not satisfied with their present condition, church life, prayer life, and gospel preaching is that they have not been filled and saturated with the Spirit. There are not many reasons; there is only this one reason. Our greatest need today is to experience the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit, and the only way for us to receive this experience is to go to the Lord. We must go to the Lord and allow Him to meet us in a definite way. Once we have been met by the Lord in a definite way, I believe that the Lord will meet us again and again morning by morning. May we all pray prevailingly and go to the Lord in a definite way that we may be brought into this experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can going to the Lord in the way that you are speaking of and praying in such a prevailing way be considered complete surrender?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This matter surely includes complete surrender. We simply need to go to the Lord at least one time in our life and tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I am not here to ask anything of You. I am just here. Lord, search me, enlighten me, and bring me into Your presence and light.&rdquo; If you pray in such a way, the Lord will honor your prayer, and He will bring you into His presence and light. When He does this, you will realize your faults and sinfulness. Then when you confess them before the Lord, He will cleanse, purge, and search you. As you open in this way, you will have some sense within as to what you should pray. Simply follow this inner sense and utter your prayer to the Lord according to it. Through this kind of prayer we breathe out all our filthiness and breathe in the Lord&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p><em>Question: Have you ever been afraid of what the Spirit might do if you opened yourself to Him in this way?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need for us to be afraid. Matthew 7:11 says, &ldquo;If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s promise to us. He will give us only good things when we ask. Moreover, if we seek the Lord with a sincere heart, a right spirit, and a pure motive, the Lord will surely keep, guard, and protect us. All those who desire to enter into the real Christian life and church life, to have the prevailing preaching of the gospel, and to realize the genuine testimony of the Lord Jesus in their city must be filled with the Spirit. It is not difficult to receive this filling, so there is no need to worry. We simply need to go to the Lord in a definite way to be met by Him. May the Lord bring us all into such an experience and bring us from being good and religious men to being genuine spiritual men.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO HAVE<br />
PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 16:13, 16-17; 1 Cor. 14:26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A CORPORATE LIFE</h2>
<p>Throughout the New Testament Christians are likened to sheep (Matt. 10:16; 18:12; 26:31; John 10:1-16, 26-28; 21:15-17; Rom. 8:36; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 2:25). This is an indication that Christians are people who need to be together. Sheep are different from dogs and cats because they are always in a flock. A dog or a cat can be alone, but a sheep must always be in a flock. The life of a sheep is a life in the flock. In order for us to be normal Christians, we must join together with other believers. Just as sheep cannot live independently of the flock, we cannot be independent or individual. We must have a Body life, a church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF THE EARLY CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our need as Christians is to come together with other Christians, but when we do so, we must come together according to the revelation and teaching of the early church as unveiled in the New Testament. When the early Christians came together during the time of the apostles, they did not have any regulations, forms, or rituals. Rather, they came together in a simple way to meet and to fellowship. In the book of Acts there were no regulations, forms, or rituals. All we see are saved persons, who had been filled with the Holy Spirit, coming together to fellowship and to share, exalt, and glorify the Lord with one another. This was their church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEGRADED CONDITION OF TODAY&rsquo;S CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>The early church met in such a simple and living way, but the church eventually fell from this genuinely spiritual condition into a man-made condition of having religious &ldquo;services.&rdquo; The religious services that take place in Christianity today are not spiritual. In Christianity the nature of the Christian meeting has changed and become degraded. Suppose a person who lives by the Lord, walks in spirit, contacts the Lord in his spirit, and is filled with the Holy Spirit were to come to a religious service in today&rsquo;s Christianity. He would feel that this religious service does not match his spirit. His spirit would be looking for one thing, but the religious service would offer him something else. It would not match his spirit, meet his need, fit his spiritual condition, or satisfy the longing of his spirit. This proves that there is something wrong with these so-called Christian services. They are formal and religious and are filled with regulations, forms, and rituals.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETING</h2>
<p>What then is a proper Christian meeting? A proper Christian meeting is one in which saints come together to exercise their spirit apart from regulations, forms, rituals, and all other religious bonds and hindrances. In a proper Christian meeting there is a spiritual order and a divine atmosphere of decency, but there are no religious bonds, hindrances, or frustrations. In such a meeting the attendants express what is in their spirit and what they sense in their spirit. They also display what they have experienced of Christ in their daily life. In such a proper Christian meeting the brothers and sisters who come together are like burning wood. Each of them has been set on fire, and each of them also sets others on fire. They burn one another like burning wood that is piled together. After each meeting, each saint has been burned and is burning. When they go home, they burn their families; when they go to work, they burn their colleagues; and when they go to a restaurant, they even burn the people in the restaurant. They are always being burned and burning others. This is what a proper Christian meeting is like.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Forsaking Regulations, Forms, Rituals,<br />
and Everything Foreign to the Scriptures</h2>
<p>In order to have proper Christian meetings, when we come together, we must forsake regulations, forms, rituals, programs, and every other thing that is not in the Scriptures. In 1932, after I had prayed to the Lord for several months, the Lord began a ministry, a work, in my hometown. At that time many of us felt that there was something wrong with Christianity, so we made a decision to forsake everything of Christianity. We received the Lord as our Savior and all-inclusive Lord, we fully received the gospel that had been preached to us, and we absolutely received everything in the Bible. We received these three items absolutely, but outside of these three things we did not receive anything that Christianity brought to us. We realized that the Lord is right, that the gospel is right, and that the Scriptures are right, but we also realized that Christianity is wrong. We made a clear differentiation between these three items and Christianity. In fact, we made a list of all the things in Christianity and examined them one by one to see if we could find these things in the Scriptures. Eventually, we had to cross nearly every item off our list and let it go because we could not find it in the Scriptures. For example, where in the Bible does it say that it is necessary to have a pastor to take the lead in a Christian meeting? You cannot find such a thing. Furthermore, where in the Bible does it say that when the believers come together, they should all sit in pews and wait for a pastor or an elder to read the Scriptures, pray, give a sermon, and then give a benediction? Nowhere in the Bible does it say this. We checked the things that we saw in Christianity against the Scriptures, and one by one we crossed nearly everything off our list.</p>
<p>After we crossed nearly everything off our list and gave up Christianity entirely as a religious system, we did not know what to do, so we simply came together. Our meetings at that time began in a variety of ways. In my home province a group of saints composed primarily of medical students began to meet together. These students had been saved and led to know the Lord in a living way. As a result, they had the desire to meet, and they began to do so. Since they did not have any place in which to meet, they went to a cemetery. Most cemeteries in China are located outside of town at the base or top of a mountain, so these young believers went to the outskirts of town to meet together in a simple way in a cemetery. In many cemeteries in China, each gravesite has a small pyramid next to it along with a stone table that people use for offering sacrifices to their ancestors. When these young believers came together in the cemetery, they sat down on the ground, put the bread and the wine on one of these stone tables, and began to meet together. At that time none of us knew what to do or how to practice the church life. The only thing that we knew was that we had to give up all the regulations, forms, and rituals, because these things cannot be found in the Scriptures.</p><h2 class="head2">Experiencing Christ, Bringing Christ,<br />
Exhibiting Christ, and Offering Christ</h2>
<p>In addition to abandoning all the things that were foreign to the Scriptures, we knew that we also needed to pray. We prayed much, and gradually the Lord began to lead us to go on in a new way. We began to receive light from the Scriptures concerning the proper way for the Lord&rsquo;s children to meet together. One thing that we began to see was that when the Lord&rsquo;s children come together, they must bring something of the Lord with them to the meeting and offer something of the Lord to God. We also saw that in order to do this, we had to experience the Lord day by day. For example, suppose there is a person whom you cannot love by yourself, but because you experience the Lord as love, you are empowered to love that person by, through, in, and with the Lord. Suppose that you also experience the Lord as patience. Although you are unable to be patient with the members of your family by yourself, you learn to experience Christ as your patience and are able to be patient with them in Christ. If day by day you experience Christ in many different ways, and all the other brothers and sisters do the same, when we come together, we will all have something of the Lord to bring with us. You may come to the meeting with the Lord as your love and patience, I may come to the meeting with the Lord as my peace and joy, and another brother may come to the meeting with Christ as his rest and satisfaction. When we come together, we can exhibit the Christ whom we have experienced, and we can offer our Christ to God. We can do this by offering a prayer or praise during the meeting. You can simply pray, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You. You are so wonderful to me. In these days You are so real to me. By You I can love those whom I would never be able to love by myself, and by You I can be patient with those with whom I would never be able to be patient.&rdquo; This kind of prayer exalts, glorifies, and exhibits the Lord. It also puts the enemy to shame and ministers Christ to the other saints. After you pray, a sister may declare, &ldquo;O Lord, I praise You. You are so real to me. I testify before the principalities and powers in the heavenlies that You are real to me. By You I can do what I would never be able to do otherwise.&rdquo; After this sister prays in this way, a brother may ask all of us to sing a hymn. The hymn may be an old hymn, but since we all have experienced Christ during the week, we can sing it in a new and living way, and as we sing, we can praise the Lord. After we sing a hymn, another brother may stand up and read a passage from the Scriptures and give a short message or testimony. If we meet in such a way, surely Christ will be exhibited and expressed, and all the saints will be strengthened, anointed, and enlightened. Christ will be ministered to all the attendants, and their needs will be met. If an unbeliever were to attend a meeting like this, surely he would be saved. This is the kind of meeting we should have.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament when the children of Israel came together, the Lord demanded that they not come empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). They had to come with their hands full of the produce of their labor. Throughout the year they had to till the ground, sow the seed, and care for their crops so that when the time of the harvest arrived, they could reap an abundance of rich produce from the land. Then when they came together, they brought the produce of their labor. Some brought wheat, some brought corn, and some brought wine. Each brought the firstfruits of his harvest and offered it to the Lord. The people also shared what they had brought with one another and enjoyed it together. Thus, both they and the Lord enjoyed what they brought when they came together.</p>
<p>The experience of the children of Israel is a picture of the proper Christian meeting. The rich produce that the children of Israel brought and offered to the Lord is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. The riches of the good land typify the many riches of Christ. Christ is full of rich produce for us to enjoy. Before we can enjoy Christ&rsquo;s riches, however, we need to labor on Christ day after day. We must till the ground, sow the seed, and reap the harvest. We should not be lazy but should labor on Christ every day. Our hearts are the ground, and Christ is the seed. Every morning we should rise early to till our hearts and to allow Christ to sow Himself into our hearts. If we do this, there will be a spiritual harvest of Christ in our daily living. Christ will be produced in us, and we will be able to live by the produce of Christ within us. In addition, we will also have a surplus of Christ that we can bring to the meetings and offer to the Lord. From Monday through Saturday we labor on Christ; that is, we experience Christ. Then on the Lord&rsquo;s Day we come together with all the saints and bring the Christ whom we have enjoyed. I bring my Christ, you bring your Christ, and we all bring our Christ and offer Him to God. This pleases the Father. This is also a great enjoyment for all of us, for we all enjoy each other&rsquo;s Christ. Meetings like this are wonderful, spiritual, heavenly, and full of Christ.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, &ldquo;each one has.&rdquo; The little word <em>has</em> in this verse is full of meaning. It means that everyone comes to the meeting with something. One has a teaching, one has a revelation, one has a tongue, and one has an interpretation. This is the pattern of the New Testament for Christian meetings. The religious services in today&rsquo;s Christianity, however, are not like this. Instead, all the members of the congregation are merely &ldquo;pew-sitters.&rdquo; Everyone comes and sits in the pews, and perhaps only one or two pastors or ministers do everything. This is wrong. This is not a proper Christian meeting. A proper Christian meeting is one in which all the participants bring something of the Lord to exhibit, express, and share with one another.</p>
<p>While there should be no regulations or forms in our practice, we have realized in the past that there are certain things that can help us have a proper Christian meeting. One of them is to sit in a mutual way, facing one another. We call this having a &ldquo;round table&rdquo; meeting. If I were to invite some brothers to my home for a meal, I would never have them sit one in front of the other, all facing the same direction, the way pews are set up in the services in Christianity. If we were to sit this way while having a meal together, what kind of feeling would this create? I would never ask the brothers to sit this way. Instead, I would ask them to sit around the table so that we could look at and speak with one another. In our meetings it is good to sit in a similar way. Of course, this is not a form, because forms never work, but we have found that sitting in this way can be very helpful to our meetings.</p>
<p>To have proper Christian meetings, we must contact the Lord daily in our private life so that we will be living Christians. Then we must come to the meetings with the realization and understanding that we are coming to exhibit Christ and to share Christ with others. When some hear this word, they may feel that since their Christian life is marked by failure, they have nothing to bring to the meetings. They may feel that they cannot function in the meetings since their experience of Christ is so poor. Even if this is your condition, you must realize that you can still function in the meetings. You can come to the meeting and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am so poor. I have failed you many times this week. Please forgive me and have mercy upon me. I have come to this meeting with nothing of You.&rdquo; If you come to the meeting and pray in this way, many of the saints may be deeply touched, and tears may come to their eyes. Moreover, you can also pray, &ldquo;Lord, since I have nothing of You, I come to contact You in Your Body and through Your Body. I believe that You have something for me in this meeting.&rdquo; You can pray in such a way, and you can also open yourself to the saints in the meeting and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, please pray for me. I have been trying to live the Christian life, but I have failed the Lord again and again. Please pray for me.&rdquo; If you bring your failures to the meeting and open yourself to the Lord and to the Body, your failures will disappear. I once knew a brother who had a very bad temper. He tried very hard to overcome his bad temper, but by himself he continually failed. One day this brother brought his weakness to the meeting and opened to the Body. After that, a wonderful thing happened&mdash;his weakness disappeared. If we experience Christ during the week, we can share our Christ during the meeting, and if we fail during the week, we can share our weaknesses with the saints. We must learn to allow others to bear our weaknesses. If we practice in this way, our meetings will be living, rich, edifying, strengthening, and enlightening.</p>
<p>When we come together to meet, there is no need for us to be formal. Let us suppose that we set the time of the meeting for 7:30 in the evening. It is good to set a definite time for the start of the meeting, but we do not need to be too formal about the time that the meeting actually begins. For example, if one sister arrives at 7:15 and a few brothers arrive at 7:20, they do not need to sit quietly until one of the leading brothers comes at 7:30 and calls a hymn. This is rather formal. If you come at 7:15 and are the first one to arrive for the meeting, you can begin to pray to the Lord quietly. When another saint arrives, the two of you can begin to pray together in a living and prevailing way. You can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, we come together for this meeting. Grant us Your presence.&rdquo; If two of you are already there, you can simply begin the meeting in this way. When others arrive at 7:25 or 7:30, they will sense the presence, anointing, and moving of the Spirit. In everything we do, we must act according to the Spirit in a very fine, divine, and orderly way, but there is no need for us to be formal. We all have the full liberty and freedom to follow the Spirit.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two requirements to having a proper Christian meeting. The first requirement is that all the attendants seek and contact the Lord in their daily lives. We all must learn how to contact the Lord in a living way and must labor to experience Christ every day. The second requirement is that when we come together, we must forget about all regulations, forms, rituals, routines, and programs. If we have a program for our meetings, we will quench the Spirit and kill the spiritual life within us. When we come together, we must abandon all things of religion and do one thing&mdash;exhibit Christ. We do this by expressing, sharing, exalting, testifying, and preaching Christ in a living way to one another.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: You have mentioned how we should begin the meeting, but how should we end the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In principle, we should end the meeting in the same way that we begin the meeting&mdash;according to the leading of the Spirit. We should end the meeting when the saints all have the sense that it is time to end the meeting.</p>
<p><em>Question: It seems that the only way for a group of believers to meet in this way is if they are one. Is this correct?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is absolutely correct; we must have the genuine oneness. This oneness is not a oneness in doctrine; it is a oneness in loving and experiencing the Lord. You love the Lord, and I love the Lord; you experience the Lord, and I experience the Lord. You may believe in baptism by sprinkling, and I may believe in baptism by immersion, but that should not bother us, because our oneness is not a oneness in doctrine but in loving and experiencing the Lord. We should not endeavor to have oneness in doctrine. Such a oneness is not genuine oneness. If we try to have oneness in doctrine, we will create division. As long as a person believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, that He was incarnated to be a man, died on the cross, was resurrected on the third day, and is now in the heavens as our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord, that is good enough. Such a believer is our brother. It does not matter whether he believes in immersion or sprinkling or what he believes related to head covering or foot-washing. These kinds of doctrinal matters should not bother us and should not be allowed to damage our oneness.</p>
<p>If some come among us and seek to promote a particular practice or doctrine, we should not exclude them. For example, in the past some have tried to promote the things of the Pentecostal movement. We did not exclude these ones; we welcomed them. We told them, &ldquo;Dear brothers and sisters, we welcome you, and we respect you, but we beg you not to promote the things of the Pentecostal movement. If you do this, you will scare some of the other brothers and sisters away. This is not the place for you to promote or to push these things. This is a place for all the believers to come together in a general way.&rdquo; Most of the ones with whom we fellowshipped in this way saw this matter and remained with us. Others who were more subjective, however, stopped coming because they could not dance or play the tambourine as they wished. When they played the tambourine, we begged them not to, saying, &ldquo;Dear brother, please do not play the tambourine here. You can play at home, but if you play here, you will scare some of the others away. We love you and respect you, but we are not in the Pentecostal church. We are here simply to come together in a general way.&rdquo; Praise the Lord that there were many who received this kind of fellowship. Some even agreed not to speak in tongues in the meetings for the sake of others.</p>
<p>We must not take any special standing. Our standing is the general standing of the church. We are simply Christians who have been saved and regenerated by the Lord and who are coming together to practice the church life in a general way. All the Lord&rsquo;s children are our brothers and sisters, and we are open to them. We do not have anything special here. Everything is general. This way truly works.</p>
<p><em>Question: How do you carry out &ldquo;Sunday School&rdquo; for the children?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In principle, there should be some teaching and some ministry in the meetings for the children and for the young people on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Strictly speaking, this kind of meeting is not a meeting of the church; it is a meeting of the work. This kind of meeting is part of the church&rsquo;s ministry, the church&rsquo;s work. When the brothers and sisters come together to pray in a mutual way, this is a church meeting. When the saints come together to have the Lord&rsquo;s table in a mutual way, this is a church meeting. When you come together to share your testimonies or to study the Word in a mutual way, this is also a church meeting. However, if you have a meeting for the children or young people, you need to have some teaching, some ministry. This is not a meeting of the church but a part of the work of the church. Similarly, when we have a meeting in which a servant of the Lord gives a message, this is not a church meeting but a meeting for the ministry, the work.</p>
<p><em>Question: If we were to have a meeting for young people on a certain evening during the week, would that also be considered a ministry meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If this meeting consists solely of a group of young believers coming together to fellowship with one another, this would be in the principle of a church meeting. Church meetings are meetings of mutuality. Meetings that are for the purpose of teaching or ministering the Word are meetings of the work, but meetings that are conducted according to the principle of mutuality are meetings of the church. It may not be possible to always have meetings for the work, but we should always have meetings in which the saints come together to pray, study, testify, and admonish in mutuality (Heb. 10:24-25). In these meetings it is not necessary to have particular ones take the lead or bear the responsibility. We must realize that in the meetings of the church, everyone has the responsibility to share something in a mutual and spontaneous way.</p>
<p><em>Question: What happens when there are visitors among us? Does this change the nature of the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If we have the Lord&rsquo;s grace, when a believer comes to our meetings for the first time, even he will be able to share something and to mingle with us. Actually, there are no &ldquo;visitors.&rdquo; We are all members of the family of God. I am a child of God, and so are you. Thus, when a believer comes to one of our meetings for the first time, we should not view him as a visitor but as a member of the family who has come home. This is the real church life.</p>
<p>If we will give up all the hindrances, bonds, and frustrating elements, the Holy Spirit will have a free way to move. When the Holy Spirit has the free way to move, many things will begin to happen. Our numbers will begin to increase. Many new believers will be brought into the church. Another thing that will happen is that the saints will genuinely grow in their spiritual life, and their spiritual gifts will begin to be manifested. In addition, the saints will begin to love one another more. The experience of the divine life will result in an increase in love, because love is the issue of life (1 John 3:14). This will cause the church life to be living, prevailing, functioning, and powerful. This is what God&rsquo;s people are longing for. Deep in their spirits they are longing for this. They cannot utter or explain what they desire, but they have such a longing. If the believers in a particular city would practice this and be faithful in this matter, many believers would be attracted.</p>
<p><em>Question: I am worried that when those who have never heard this kind of fellowship come among us, they will not understand what we are doing. Is this not a concern?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to worry that others will not understand. If we are faithful before the Lord to practice to have proper Christian meetings in a way that is truly spiritual and full of life, when others come among us, they will appreciate what we are doing and realize that it is of the Lord. Surely the Holy Spirit will move in them to vindicate, prove, and confirm this way.</p>
<p>Every day we have three meals a day&mdash;breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is not a form; it is a human need. If you eat only one meal a day, this will be detrimental to your health. To maintain the health of our physical body, we need to eat at least three times a day. Similarly, to maintain our spiritual health and to have a proper church life, we need to meet together several times in a given week. It is not healthy to meet only once a week. Every week we need to meet together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship together and admonish one another. It is fine to mingle the study of the Word with the prayer or with the fellowship, but in principle we need to have times together every week to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship. In addition, according to the pattern of the New Testament, we also need to meet to have the Lord&rsquo;s table. First Corinthians 11:25 says, &ldquo;Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.&rdquo; The word <em>often</em> in the phrase <em>as often as you drink it</em> indicates that we need to have the Lord&rsquo;s table as often as possible. In the book of Acts the saints had the Lord&rsquo;s table every day (2:46). Later the believers had the Lord&rsquo;s table on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the first day of the week (20:7; Rev. 1:10). In addition to these four kinds of meetings&mdash;meetings for prayer, for the study of the Word, for fellowship, and for the Lord&rsquo;s table&mdash;the Lord may also raise up someone among us who has the gift of teaching. If this is the case, we can gather together periodically and allow this gifted one to minister the Word to us. This would be a special time for the ministry of the Word. This will be a help to us, but this is only something special. Ordinarily, the saints need to meet together three to four times a week for prayer, the study of the Word, fellowship, and the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, this should not be considered a regulation but a principle to meet our spiritual need.</p></body></html>
