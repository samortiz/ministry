   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many years ago, the inner-life people made being regenerated too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regeneration is instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D.L. Moody said that regeneration is the biggest miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a great miracle that a sinner can be made a son of God in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regeneration and being filled with the Spirit essentially and economically are very normal, but they are also miraculous to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are miraculous normalities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the winter training of 1987, I gave a message on the miraculous normality in God's New Testament economy see The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ chapter thirteen .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever has been bequeathed to us in God's New Testament economy is very normal in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The very Christ has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now He is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is even in our mouth and in our heart Rom 10:8 see note 1, Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We just need to call, "O Lord Jesus," and we get Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may not have much time in the morning, but at least we can set apart ten minutes to spend with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can spend these ten minutes to say, "O Lord Jesus," and we can turn to His Word to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The heavenly manna has been made available to us, and we just need to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The leading ones in the churches must learn and be burdened to be revived by the Lord every morning, and they have to help the other brothers and sisters to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whoever practices this will become living and even victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will be eager to speak Christ to their relatives, acquaintances, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They will also anticipate meeting in the evening with their family and with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they meet, they will have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will have something living to render to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The key point is that we need to have a revived life, a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not just a matter of changing our way outwardly to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like changing the coffin of a dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The new way is to raise up the dead ones to be the living ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The new way is altogether not a formal thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why visiting people requires us to pay a big price.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to lose our face and sacrifice our time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to suffer people's rejection of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that all of the saints can be brought into the top way of preaching the gospel, the way of visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No other way is as effective or as prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also need to endeavor to set up home meetings with the newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This requires much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The home meetings test us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we are, how much we have, and how much we can do will be tested by the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having home meetings is not a simple matter of reading a few verses from the Bible or a passage from the Life-studies or Life Lessons with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The success of the home meetings depends upon who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Can we enliven people?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This depends upon what kind of persons we are with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The new way is not just a way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is actually a proper life, a revived life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The new way requires us to have a permanent revival day by day.</S>
