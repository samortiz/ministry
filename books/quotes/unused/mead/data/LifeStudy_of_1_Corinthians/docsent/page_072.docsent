   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING THROUGH THE SUPPLY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once again I wish to point out that when we read or study the Bible, we need to get into the spirit of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 3 the burden in Paul s spirit was to help the believers at Corinth realize what they had and what they needed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They had the divine life and the Holy Spirit, and they needed growth growth in life and growth in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how could these believers grow?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they were to grow, they needed to be watered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the saints may water others, growth comes only from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because growth comes from God alone, those who water others must help them contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, contacting God is itself the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the best way to be watered is to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you can help a weaker one or a young one have some contact with God, that will bring in the genuine watering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The watering will then supply the ingredients of life to those who already possess the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As these ingredients are added to them, they will have an additional supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then spontaneously they will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as fertilizer helps plants to grow in a spontaneous way, so the believers in Christ also grow spontaneously by receiving an additional supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of those in the charismatic movement or the Pentecostal movement do not care for life or for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most of them do not even understand what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of concentrating on the development of the divine life within the believers, they give their attention to the pursuit of miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, many who emphasize things such as speaking in tongues are extremely immature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul s emphasis in 1 Corinthians is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This book reveals that Christ is the unique center of God s economy and also our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This wonderful One is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Continually we need to exercise our spirit to be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we contact the Lord in this way, the more we are watered, supplied, and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then spontaneously we shall grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I thank the Lord that many of the saints in the churches throughout the world are experiencing the genuine growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need in the Lord s recovery, and what the Lord is seeking among us, is more growth in life, more development of the initial gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have seen that in 3:1 Paul indicates that the believers at Corinth were infants in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They, of course, had been genuinely saved, but they were fleshly and even fleshy, not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They exhibited the signs of infancy: not able to receive solid food, but only milk; being full of jealousy and strife and walking according to man; and exalting spiritual giants to cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The situation in Corinth was the same as that found among many believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In almost every Christian group certain leaders are exalted in such a way as to cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, many Christians are not able to receive solid food, but only a small amount of milk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul knew that the Corinthian believers needed feeding, watering, and the additional supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They needed to be fed with solid food v. 2 , they needed to be watered continually vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>6-7 , and they needed the additional supply of life from God so that they could grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are the very things we need in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be fed with solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also need to water others and to be watered ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that even the youngest and weakest among us is able to water the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in watering others we should not try to solve their problems or presume to do God s work by trying to help others grow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, we should simply take time to contact God together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then others will be watered, and God will give them growth through the additional life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May we all see that what is urgently needed is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we live in a way which produces the growth in life, and may we function by planting, feeding, watering, and also by leaving the actual growth to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>GOD S FELLOW-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 8 Paul says that he who plants and he who waters are one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same verse he goes on to say, Each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reward is an incentive to the ministers of Christ who labor by planting or watering on God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 3:9 Paul says, For we are God s fellow-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that God is also a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While the ministers of Christ, His fellow-workers, are working on His farm, He also is working.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What a privilege and glory that men can be God s fellow-workers, working together with God on His farm to grow Christ!</S>
