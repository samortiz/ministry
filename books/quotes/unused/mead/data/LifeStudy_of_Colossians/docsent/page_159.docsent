   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:19 Paul says that the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With God Himself there can be no growth, for He is complete and perfect eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, the Body still needs to grow with the growth, the increase, of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more God is added into us, the more we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what it means to grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for any living organism to grow, there must be some element which causes it to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must have something with which and by which to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, if children do not eat, they cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way we grow spiritually is to have God added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that we grow with the addition, with the increase, of God, by having God added into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The little word with in 2:19 is important.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With what does the Body grow?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Does it grow with doctrine or Bible knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We grow with the increase of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God in Himself is perfect and complete, but there is still the need for Him to increase within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As I was praying over 2:19, the Lord showed me that although He is eternally perfect and complete, I did not have that much of Him within me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I realized my need for God to grow in me, to have Him added into me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I was enlightened to see the meaning of Paul s expression in 2:19, grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need God to be added into us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to have Him grow in us, to increase in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we consider 2:19, we must realize that the word God is not merely a term, and God Himself is not simply the object of our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is rich in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is rich in glory and in all the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is rich in love, kindness, mercy, light, life, power, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Oh, God s riches are endless!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now this rich God is adding Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is implied by the phrase, grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s riches are the element and substance by which we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 3:10 and 11 Paul speaks of the new man, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the new man Christ is all the members, and He is in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no room for the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no room for Americans or Chinese, for British or French, for you or me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the new man Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church as the new man, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This implies that He is every brother and every sister.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This also implies that every brother and sister must be constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the new man there cannot be Jewish members and Gentile members; there can only be Christ-members.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would be constituted of Christ, Christ must be added into us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must be permeated with Christ, saturated with Christ, and have Christ organically wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, we shall be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, in reality, He will be all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will be every member, every part, of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The new man does not come into existence by taking Christians from various countries and bringing them together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That would be a new organization, not the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The new man comes into being as we are saturated, filled, and permeated with Christ and replaced by Him through an organic process.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The new man is Christ in all the saints permeating us and replacing us until all natural distinctions have been eliminated and everyone is constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ as all and in all in the new man should not be mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, the rich, substantial Christ must actually be wrought into us organically until He replaces our natural being with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This can take place only as we remain rooted in Him and absorb His riches into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These riches will then become the substance, the element, which will saturate us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then Christ will become us, and we shall become constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not only to grow with Christ, but it is also to be built up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>ABSORBING THE RICHES FROM THE SOIL</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both the growth and the building depend on being rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why Paul uses the perfect tense to say having been rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ, the good land, is the portion, the allotment, of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the good land, He Himself is the rich, fertile soil.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Having been rooted in Him, we must daily absorb the rich nourishment of Christ into us to be the element that causes us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All day long tender roots should absorb the riches of Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we absorb these riches, the more we shall be saturated by Christ and organically replaced by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is to grow and to be built up in Christ.</S>
