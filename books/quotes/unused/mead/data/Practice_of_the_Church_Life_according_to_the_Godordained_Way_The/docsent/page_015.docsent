   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. Concerning the Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dissenting ones also raised questions concerning the matter of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1986 I gave a series of messages that were misunderstood and misused by them see Elders' Training, Book 7, One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They thought that I meant that I am the leader in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, in the 1987 Summer Training I gave additional messages to point out that, actually, the New Testament leadership is not a person but is the teaching of the apostles see The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy, chapter nineteen, especially pages 172-173, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul's teaching, the teaching of the New Testament, not Paul himself, was the actual leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, among us the teaching of those who teach the New Testament apostles' teaching is the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The leadership in the Lord's recovery is actually not according to anyone's teaching, but according to the apostles' teaching, which is the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, the saints in the recovery should not follow me; they should follow my teaching, if my teaching is according to the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1934 Brother Nee encountered much opposition in his ministry, and I went to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I said to him, "Brother Nee, from the first day that we began to have contact, there was no personal affection between you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, I have followed you absolutely, and I do have the assurance that I am following the right way because you have the Lord's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The revelation you pass on is according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, I am not following you personally; I follow the revelation you have released."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then I said, "Brother Nee, even if from today you would give up the way of the Lord's recovery, I would remain in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you believe that you are in the Lord's recovery following a man?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of the dissenting ones repented to the uttermost that he listened to only one man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said that in doing so he had committed a great sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would like to ask you all: Do you listen to one man's word?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, you do not listen to one man; you listen to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have the assurance that since I began to speak for the Lord, I did not speak anything that was not according to the New Testament principles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, to follow the ministry is absolutely right; it is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's recovery was raised up in China through Brother Nee's teaching for exactly thirty years, from 1922 through 1952.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In those thirty years there was no one else who put out the New Testament teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the 1950s I was sent to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of his imprisonment in 1952, from that time Brother Nee's speaking ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had no intention to stand up to replace him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I only knew to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I put out teaching after teaching, but I did not have the intention that I would be the only one who would teach the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we moved into the hall in Anaheim, I gathered the leading co-workers in the country to have a writers' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I encouraged all the co-workers to write something, and they all took my charge to go back to write.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, I found out that very little writing came out of them directly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nearly all of their writing was a reprinting of my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Several localities put out magazines, but most of the messages in those publications were a reprinting of my teaching, with some being a repeating of Brother Nee's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Realizing that this was the situation, in 1986 I encouraged all the brothers to stop this kind of repetition, and they all complied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Speaking honestly, in the forty years from 1950 through 1990, whose teaching has been available to raise up the church, to build up the church, to feed the saints, and so forth?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, the foundation was laid by Brother Nee's teaching, but by whose teaching has the building up been carried out?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In my home I still have a book published by the top theological school in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In that book, which encourages people to study the Bible and teaches people how to study the Bible, there is a brief word that says that for the past forty years, counting from 1949, among the Chinese Christians the expounding of the Bible could never go beyond the realm of the teaching of the "Assembly Hall people," that is, the teaching in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we were to take away Brother Nee's teaching and my teaching, where would the church be today?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By this we can see the enemy's subtlety, which is just to smear the ministry.</S>
