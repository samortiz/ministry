We can consider the matter by an illustration. In the Western world, men build houses with concrete blocks. These blocks are like the Chinese bricks, except that they are hollow inside. When men build walls, first they fill up these blocks with cement, then put cement outside the blocks to join the blocks together. The life that we received is the Lord's life; it is not the life of our flesh. We become one Body through the one Holy Spirit. What we have received within from the Lord is the Holy Spirit, and the nature of our oneness without is also the Holy Spirit. It is like the concrete blocks which have cement within and without. The nature of what is there within is the same as the nature of what is there without. We are baptized into one Spirit, and we are made to drink of the same Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). That which is first put into us is the same as that which is added on to us later. This is why we can become one Body. What we have received from the Lord is the same as what is joining us together. The basis of life is the basis of fellowship. We can say that there is only one Body because all the members are of the same nature. The Body is one, because there is only one Holy Spirit. The members issue from the Body, and though there are many members, it is still one Body (1 Cor. 12:12). The origin of the members is the Body. From the one Body, the many members are produced. Later, the Holy Spirit joins these many members into one Body again. It is like a wall being composed of many bricks, and the many bricks put together become the one wall. Oneness is not based on having the same heart. It is based on having the same nature. We drink of the Holy Spirit within, and we are baptized into the Holy Spirit without. This is the oneness of the believers. As members, we proceed from the Body and consummate in the Body. Looking back, we are one Body, and looking forward, we are also one Body. Because we are one, we can be coordinated together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Power of the Holy Spirit<br>Being in the Body</H2><P>Based on this oneness, there is the consciousness of the Body. The operation of the Holy Spirit is found in the Body. The Holy Spirit is not simply the power of single individuals, but the power of the Body. The service of the Body should be the manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit. An individual before God is like a one-dimensional plane, whereas the Body before God is like a three-dimensional object. Today, the age of individual ministry is over. The gospel has to be preached by the whole church. Everything needs to be dealt with by the whole church. In the past, a single individual might have been able to preach the gospel and to have results in his work. But today, all these things must be done in the Body. Once we touch the reality of the Body, the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested. Many times, matters cannot be taken care of by one or two brothers alone. Many people think that the power of the Holy Spirit is for individuals and that a man can take home a bundle of the Holy Spirit's power and use it bit by bit. However, we have to realize that the power of the Holy Spirit is in the Body. Life issues from the Body and returns to the Body.</P>
