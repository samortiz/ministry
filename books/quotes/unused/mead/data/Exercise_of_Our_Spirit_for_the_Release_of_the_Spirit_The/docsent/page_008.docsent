   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELEASING THE SPIRIT BY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REJOICING, PRAYING, THANKING, AND PRAISING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We not only must pray but also thank the Lord, praise Him, and rejoice in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To do this is to open our mouth, our chimney.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of keeping the chimney closed and thereby choking off the draft, we must open the chimney.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we take the cover off the chimney by opening our mouth to rejoice, we cause the Spirit to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead of reading the Word in a formal way, we should remove the covers, open the chimney, and let the air in by rejoicing while we read.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the fire will burn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At times we should even be beside ourselves when we read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 2 Corinthians 5:13 Paul says, For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before man we should be sober, but before God and in His presence we must be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, we must be released from our self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have never been beside ourselves before God, we are somewhat abnormal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to release ourselves by opening our mouth to rejoice and sing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must learn how to release the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This matter of releasing the Spirit has much to do with rejoicing, praying, thanking the Lord, and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:16-19 Paul says, Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This short passage mentions four matters: rejoicing, praying, giving thanks, and not quenching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is clear from this passage that the matter of not quenching the Spirit is very much related to the other three matters of rejoicing, praying, and giving thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not rejoice, pray, or give thanks to the Lord, we will surely quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we must learn to rejoice, pray, thank, and praise so that the Spirit will not be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is very simple yet very vital.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Much of the time we choke off the draft and quench the Spirit because our spirit and mind remain closed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would simply open ourselves, the draft would come in, and the Holy Spirit would burn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way to open our being is simple; it is to rejoice, pray, thank, and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some might say that they do not have the grace to be open and that if they had the grace, they would be open.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We ourselves must open our being and let the air come in. If we allow the air to come in, the Spirit will burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUR NEED TO BE SIMPLE AND OPEN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today in Christianity there are two kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, there are the worldly, backslidden believers who have no heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are indifferent toward spiritual things, the things of the Lord, and come to the meetings in an indifferent way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Obviously, it is very difficult for such persons to open themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, there are the so-called spiritual believers who are often so spiritual that they close themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, both the backsliding believers and the spiritual believers close themselves so that there is no opening or entrance for the draft and, consequently, no burning of the Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not consider ourselves better than the backslidden believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not think that although they have not seen a vision, we have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not think that we are so spiritual or consider ourselves higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, we should remove the cover from our being, allow the draft to come in, and let the Holy Spirit burn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should be simple and open like a child Matt 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, when we pray, we should not pray in an overly spiritual manner; rather, we should pray like a child cf.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Luke 18:10-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our urgent need as Christians who are seeking the Lord is that we open ourselves, make ourselves simple, and remove all the coverings so that the Spirit can get through and can burn within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BEING SIMPLE AND OPEN IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The longer we meet together, the more formal we tend to become, and the more formal we become, the more we quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are formal in the meetings, everyone is careful not to open himself, and no one dares to open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must break through this barrier, forget about everything, and make our meetings simple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should come to the meeting as if we have just been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Inwardly we should be new.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There should be nothing old; everything should be in newness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we must take care of others in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the children of God should come to the meeting and feel free to participate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we pray too spiritually, we intimidate those who are uncomfortable to open their mouths and those who are afraid that they do not come up to our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes in the meetings the saints only say amen when the more spiritual brothers speak and never when the younger ones share.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This shows that they prefer the spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the spiritual ones do not need any more encouragement because they are already bold enough.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The younger saints, on the other hand, are weak and timid and need our encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they pray, we should say amen to encourage them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not make the meetings too spiritual because this kills the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more spiritual the brothers become, the more dead they become and the more dead the meetings become.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must forget about spirituality and be simple and open.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must endeavor not to know spirituality, Christianity, knowledge, doctrines, or anything else except to open ourselves, to be simple, to praise the Lord, and to remove the covers and let the draft in so that the Spirit can burn.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In our meetings there must be a real burning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should pray as children so that others will be encouraged to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we were like children, our meetings would be simple, free, and open.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our meetings must liberate and release people, not bind them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever people come to our meetings, they should have the sense that they have been liberated, set free, and released.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For this we need the burning of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This matter is very much in the hands of the responsible and leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who are taking the lead in the churches must take care of this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If they do not take care of these matters, the Spirit will always be quenched in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The responsible ones must take the lead to open themselves, to break through the barrier of formality, to forget about spiritual rules and regulations, and to even forget about spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They must realize that we do not want anything other than Christ Himself in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What we need today is not more knowledge but to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we have the burning of the Holy Spirit within us, we will have power, impact, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, by the Lord s mercy, grace, and help, let us determine to learn to open ourselves and to let the draft in so that the Spirit may burn within us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A FEW MATTERS THAT CAN QUENCH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Spiritually speaking, it is relatively easy to start the fire, but it is just as easy to quench the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even a small matter such as being a little careless or saying something slightly improper can quench the fire of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you want to start a fire in a stove, you must do certain things to help the fire to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the same way, the Spirit needs our cooperation in certain matters in order to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, it is difficult for the Spirit to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we are loose and careless in our speaking, in our attitude, and in doing things, no matter how small they may seem, we will quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thus, we must be careful not to be careless or loose.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Many times in the meetings and in our daily life we have the sense to pray, but we do not obey this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even a little disobedience like this can quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, if we obey this feeling and pray, the Spirit will burn.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you are a sister in the kitchen washing the dishes, and you have a feeling to pray, then you should immediately pray.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no need to stop washing; you can pray as you wash.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, if you have the burden to stop washing and pray, you may stop and kneel down in the kitchen to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is no need to go anywhere else to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Gossip also quenches the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Nothing quenches the Spirit so much as a little gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must realize that whenever we gossip with others, we are quenching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As Christians we must completely give up our gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We may think that these matters are trivial and do not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, they do matter because they determine whether the Spirit will burn or whether it will be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we turn our gossip into prayer, the Spirit will burn.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Joking can also kill the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we joke too much, we will quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This does not mean that we must always be formal or official.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, we should not joke because our joking does not help the Spirit to burn but only quenches it.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When we go to the Lord to pray, we should not consider and think about what to pray, because this also quenches the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we go to pray, we should forget about everything and pray in a spontaneous, natural, and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The more we pray in this way, the more we will have the flow and the burning of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We must take care of all these small matters because these are the things that can quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we take care of these matters, we will be those who are always on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The basic matter is that we must learn how to open ourselves by rejoicing, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything.</S>
