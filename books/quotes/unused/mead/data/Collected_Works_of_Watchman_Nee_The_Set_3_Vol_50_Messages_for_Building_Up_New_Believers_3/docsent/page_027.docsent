   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ASCETICISM HAVING NO PLACE IN CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a person is saved, he subconsciously carries this thought of asceticism into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Though he never practiced it in the past, he admired those who practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Gentiles indulge in lusts on the one hand and admire asceticism on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They crave material things, yet they admire those who are free from material things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They cannot be a certain way, yet they admire those who are that way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After they become Christians, they carry their privately cherished ascetic ideals into the church, thinking that it is the duty of a saved person to practice asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Meaning of Asceticism</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being the Denial of Material Things</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and the Suppression of Lust</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does asceticism mean?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To many people, it means the denial of outward material things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The less they have to do with outward material things, the better they think they are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are afraid that outward material things feed their inner lust.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All ascetics admit that all kinds of lust reside in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the lust for food to the lust for sex, every kind of lust resides in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These lusts control the conduct of almost everyone on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many think that in order to be holy, they have to overcome these lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Outwardly speaking, asceticism is a denial of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Inwardly speaking, asceticism is the suppression of one's own lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They hope that they can become holy by depriving lust of any form of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Christians Not Advocating Asceticism</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we must realize that a Christian should never advocate asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a Christian advocates asceticism, he is practicing something very superficial indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us read some portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people try to suppress themselves in the matters of food, lust, or other material things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They think that this is Christianity and that this is the ideal life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Bible shows us that asceticism has no place in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>HAVING DIED WITH CHRIST AND BEING FREED</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>FROM THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians 2:20-23 says, "If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch, regarding things which are all to perish when used according to the commandments and teachings of men?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and lowliness and severe treatment of the body, but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A. A Fundamental Fact</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Crucifixion with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul said to the Colossian believers, "You died with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul considered this a fundamental Christian fact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians are those who have died with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament shows us that every Christian has died with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 6:6 tells us that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Galatians 2:20 also says that we have been crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Galatians 5:24 shows us that our flesh with its passions and lusts has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible repeatedly says that Christians are those who are crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the cross of Golgotha is the cross of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Christian life begins with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It begins not only with Christ's cross, but also with one's own cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The cross of Christ became our cross when we accepted it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person is not a Christian if he has not accepted the fact of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he is a Christian, he has claimed the reality of the cross of Christ as his own.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, he has died in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul had no doubt about the reality of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not question this fact at all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He took it as the basis of his argument.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In effect, he was saying, "Since you have died with Christ, certain things will happen."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Ting is sitting here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the fact that his name is Ting is indisputable, we can make some statements based on this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the statements are based on an indisputable fact, the statements will also be indisputable: "Since your name is Ting, I can say this and that."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul was giving a conclusion based on a fact.</S>
