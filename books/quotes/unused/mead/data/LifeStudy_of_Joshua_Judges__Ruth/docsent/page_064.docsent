   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE FIVE RUTH S REWARD FOR GOD S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Ruth 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider Ruth s reward for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that Ruth made a choice for her goal and that she exercised her right to enjoy the rich land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Under the prodding of Naomi, Ruth sought for a resting place, and finally she received a reward, a gain, for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A real seeker after God, Ruth eventually gained what she sought after.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She chose her goal, she exercised her right, and she sought for a husband and a home as a resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. GAINING A REDEEMING HUSBAND</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to chapter four, there are four aspects of Ruth s reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, in verses 10 through 13 she gained a redeeming husband typifying Christ as the redeeming Husband to the believers Rom 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ruth s gaining of such a husband was witnessed and blessed by the people and the elders in the gate Ruth 4:11-12 , and it was also blessed by God v. 13b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be impressed with the fact that Ruth s reward was for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man was created by God with a purpose according to His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This economy is not a common plan or merely a small arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the universe the divine and eternal economy is second only to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to His economy God created the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God s enemy came in to attempt to break the line that joins man to God and God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 3 Satan cut this line, but eventually Christ as the promised seed of the woman v. 15 came to repair the line by redeeming man back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, there were not many on earth who had linked themselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of Ruth the line between God and man was very thin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was thin to such an extent that it consisted mainly of two persons, a couple Boaz and Ruth This couple was brought together in a marvelous and sovereign way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Boaz was born an Israelite and Ruth was born in Moab, an incestuous country, Ruth was brought to the good land, even to Bethlehem, the city of David.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ruth had the right to glean from many different fields, but she went to Boaz s field.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Naomi, Ruth s mother-in-law, learned that Ruth had gleaned in Boaz s field, she was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Desiring to find a resting place for Ruth, Naomi instructed her about what to do 3:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ruth followed Naomi s direction, and she and Boaz were brought into a courtship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they were at the threshing floor, she applied to be his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said to her, All that you say, I will do for you; for all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And now it is true that I am a kinsman, yet there is a kinsman closer than I. Stay for the night; and in the morning if he will do the kinsman s duty, fine; let him do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if he is not willing to do the kinsman s duty for you, I will do it for you, as Jehovah lives vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a very kind way Boaz was indicating that he would act in accordance with God s ordinances Lev 25:25; Deut 25:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their courtship led to their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through that marriage Ruth, a Moabite widow, gained the holy citizens citizenship, becoming one among God s elect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The crucial point here is that, as part of her reward for God s economy, Ruth gained a redeeming husband, who typifies Christ as the redeeming Husband to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only Christ can be both our Husband and our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before we were saved, we were in trouble and could not get out of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now as believers in Christ, we have a Husband who is our eternal, present, and daily Redeemer, rescuing us, saving us, delivering us, from all our troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a gain this is!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>REDEEMED FROM THE INDEBTEDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>OF THE DEAD HUSBAND</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition to gaining a redeeming husband, Ruth was redeemed from the indebtedness of the dead husband Ruth 4:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This typifies being redeemed from the sin of the believers old man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ruth s dead husband had sold his field, and the indebtedness of that transaction had fallen upon her in the marriage union and needed to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Boaz said to the kinsman who was closer than he, On the day you buy the field from Naomi s hand, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead man, in order to raise up the dead man s name upon his inheritance v. 5 . That kinsman replied, I cannot redeem it for myself, or else it will mar my own inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Redeem for yourself what I should redeem, for I cannot redeem it v. 6 . Boaz did so, redeeming Ruth from her indebtedness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our Husband, Christ, is not merely capable; He is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has redeemed us from the indebtedness of our dead husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to Romans 7 the dead husband, our old husband, is our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God created us to be His wife, but we rebelled against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We gave Him up and assumed the position of the husband for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our sinful husband encumbered us with many debts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But on the day we married Christ, we received a Husband who is our almighty, omnipotent Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all need Christ to be such a Husband to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Having Him as our Husband, we should come to Him and simply say, Lord Jesus, I need You.</S>
