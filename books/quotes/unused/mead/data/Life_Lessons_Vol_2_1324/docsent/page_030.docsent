   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This tells us that once we are saved, we should offer to God the rich surplus from our material riches, which He gives us for the advancement of His gospel.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, there is a need for the believers to supply them with the material riches they offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Timothy 5:17 tells us that the believers ought to supply material riches to the elders who take the lead well and those who labor in God's word and teaching the local elders .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen previously that, according to 3 John 2, prosperity is God's blessing to prosper us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should determine the amount of our offering to God based upon the condition of our being prospered due to His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Each person should determine his own amount according to whatever he has, not according to what he does not have 2 Cor 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2 "He who sows sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who sows with blessings, with blessings also shall reap; each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver" 2 Cor 9:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our offering of material riches, we will reap little if we sow little, and we will reap much if we sow much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each person should purpose in his own heart how much he should offer without sorrow or necessity, since God loves him who is a cheerful giver.</S>
