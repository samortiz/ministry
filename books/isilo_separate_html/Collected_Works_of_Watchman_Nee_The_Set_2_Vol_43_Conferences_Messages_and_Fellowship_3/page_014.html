We need to see the work of His love. God is love, and He loves man. But how does He love man? Does He show His love by simply patting us on the shoulder and saying, "I love you"? What would be the use of this kind of love? We have already seen that man is a sinner and that he needs to be saved. But man has no way to save himself. Since man has no way, God provides the way. We have no way, but God's love provides the way. Romans 5:8 says, "God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." God's love was expressed by Christ coming to this world to die on man's behalf and solve the problem of perdition. Man is a sinner and cannot afford to pay the high price that is required to save himself. How does God save man? He put man's sins upon Christ; Christ received God's judgment on our behalf. When we see Christ's vicarious death on the cross, we know that God's love has been manifested. This is the third revelation in the Bible concerning God's love. There are three great revelations concerning God's love in the Bible: (1) God is love, (2) God loves man, and (3) God's love is manifested through the cross. These three great revelations give us an assessment of God's love.</p><p>The word love results in many things. Because God loves us, He does many things for us. If God did not love us, there would be nothing for Him to do. Suppose a person does not love anyone; his life will be very ordinary. However, the minute he loves someone, trouble comes. He wants to do many things for the one he loves. Because God loves man, He does many things for man. God's salvation is based on His love for man; there is no other explanation for God's salvation. He has saved us because He loves us, not because He owes us some debt or has some moral responsibility to do so. God does not have any responsibility to save us. The salvation that is spoken of in the Bible is based upon love. Love is the only reason, the only motivation, of God's salvation. If God did nothing, no one could say that He was wrong. But because God loves us, He is willing to do a great deal, even having Christ die on the cross for us.</p><h2 class="head1">MERCY AND GRACE</h2><p>Now let us consider how God's love is manifested. The Bible shows us that God's love is manifested in two aspects: One is grace, which is positive; the other is mercy, which is negative. There are several verses in the New Testament that put mercy and grace together. Mercy is God's perception of man's present condition; grace is God's saving of man from his present condition. Mercy is God coming to us, whereas grace is God bringing us to Himself. Mercy is God coming down, whereas grace is God lifting man. Mercy is God looking upon man's suffering, whereas grace is God granting man salvation.</p><p>Suppose a brother has ragged clothes, ill health, and a poor family. If you have compassion on him, you will have concern for his ragged clothes, ill health, and poverty. This is mercy. This is not grace, because you did not do anything for him. If you treat him nicely, provide him with clothes, food, dwelling, and some money, this is grace. Grace is your favor toward him, whereas mercy is your concern toward him. It is not enough to have just mercy. Mercy cannot solve man's problems. Grace must come in before one can receive the help.</p><p>Mercy is God coming into our midst, whereas grace is God bringing us into His midst. In His incarnation as a man, God apprehended man's sufferings and bondage to sin, pain, and Satan. This is His mercy. When Christ came to the earth, He spoke mostly of mercy and not much of grace. The four Gospels rarely mention "grace." Grace came in only after He died on the cross, when God put man's sins upon Christ and Christ took our sins away. The Epistles frequently speak of grace because God's salvation has been accomplished. God loves us; His heart is filled with mercy toward our condition. Therefore, He accomplished something for us to save us. God's heart is full of mercy for us&mdash;this is the best factual basis for asking God to do something for us. When we pray that God would forgive our sins, what is God's basis for answering our prayer? We can say, "O God, I am evil. I am a sinner. I cannot save myself. I cannot even come to You for salvation. But the Bible says that You love mercy and not sacrifice. O God, please have mercy on me; forgive me." Both the New Testament and the Old Testament say that God desires "mercy and not sacrifice" (Matt. 9:13; Hosea 6:6). Mercy is God giving something to man, whereas sacrifice is man giving something to God. But God says, "I like to give something to you, but I do not like you to give anything to Me." We cannot perform any good. Even if there is some goodness in us, it is not perfect. We have nothing to depend on; we have nothing to rely upon. We can only depend on God's mercy. We can count on God's mercy and say, "God, unless You have become a merciless God, I am delighted and happy to seek Your mercy. I want to be a person on whom You have mercy."</p><p>Grace, however, requires some kind of work. Love is in the heart, mercy is in the feelings, but grace is in the actions. If there is love within but no grace without, nothing much can be accomplished. Love is something hidden within, and grace is accomplished without. When grace is received, it becomes love. When love is manifested, it becomes grace. What is within is love, and what is acted out is grace. Grace has two special characteristics. First, it is generous, and second, it is God doing something for man. In the Bible there is God's grace and Christ's grace. God's grace mainly refers to His generosity, whereas Christ's grace mainly refers to His work for us. One verse which we are all familiar with and which is often used by pastors in the denominations for their benedictions is 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</p><p>Why does this verse speak of the love of God, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit? Can we change it to "the grace of God," "the love of the Lord Jesus Christ," and "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit"? No, because the characteristic of God is love. God is love. God in heaven is the source of all love. He is the source of love. Then Christ came to the earth to actually accomplish God's work of love. He died on the cross; He was crucified by men for the redemption of man. This is the work of God's love for man, which is grace. Therefore, God's characteristic is love and Christ's characteristic is grace. The fellowship of the Spirit is the flowing into us of all that Christ has accomplished for us. The source is God. Following God's love is Christ's work which is His grace. God is love and Christ came to manifest this love. But if it merely stops there, it is still of no benefit to us. Christ died on Calvary. He died on the cross to accomplish the work of redemption for us. This is good. But the accomplishment of Christ can only be applied to man through the Spirit. God's love is the source, Christ's grace is the operation of God's love, and the Spirit's fellowship channels this work of Christ to man. The Spirit changes the objective things of Christ into subjective experiences of Christ. He wroughts that which is outside of man into man. This is why 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</p><p>An illustration of this can be found in the hospital where a doctor gives a prescription, a pharmacist dispenses the medicine, and the nurse ultimately delivers the medicine to the patient. If you only know the kind of medicine you need without having anyone deliver it to you, the medicine cannot get into your body. You need to have all three before the medicine can take effect. Hence, 2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit.</p><p>Grace is what Christ does. If it is something we do, it is not grace. If you earn money for your living, it is not grace. Suppose I am a beggar, and others give me something to eat&mdash;this is grace. Since grace is Christ's work, it is generous. In the Bible grace has three qualities. We can describe them in business terms. The first quality of grace is that it is not a purchase; it is not even a fair exchange. It is not something that is worth a few dollars and that is bought for a few dollars. Second, grace is not cheap; it is not like an item that is worth two dollars but is sold for one dollar. Third, grace is not loaned; it is not something which you receive that must be repaid later.</p><p>Grace cannot be purchased. If we have to do something before we can come before God to be saved, this salvation is not based on grace. Grace does not use our good work as the basis for our redemption. Grace is given to us freely. Therefore, the Bible says we are saved by grace, not by works (Eph. 2:8-9). Grace is freely given to us by God.</p><p>Grace is not cheap. Grace is not something that we can bargain for at a low price. It is not that we work a little and Christ supplements the rest, as if Christ were some kind of collateral. If we had to do something first and then trust in the Lord for what we could not do, our salvation would be nothing more than shopping for a bargain, because we would be paying a certain amount first and then relying on Christ to pay the rest. No, grace is absolutely not a bargain purchase. None of us can afford to pay even the slightest amount of the price. Grace is entirely the work of Christ.</p><p>Third, grace is not a loan. Many people say that grace is necessary for salvation, but that Christ will reclaim His salvation if we do not produce good deeds after salvation. This is like saying that grace has been loaned to us, and that it needs to be repaid. This is absolutely wrong. Grace is forever the work of Christ. It is totally and freely given. There is no need for us to ever repay anything.</p><p>Now let us read some more verses. If this is God's word, you have to believe it; if it is my word, you can ignore it. Please read Romans 3:23-27. This is the most difficult passage in the Bible. Man has a big problem: He is a sinner. If God did not love us, nothing would happen even though man is a sinner. Since man sins, God could let man perish, and there would be nothing that God would have to do. But God has two big problems. First, man has sins, and second, God loves man. Satisfying the demands of these two items requires God's work. In order for God to satisfy His love toward man, He must first solve the problem of man's sins. Because man has sinned and because God loves man, there is the need of grace. The initiation or motivation of grace is God's love for man, while the necessity of grace is due to man's sins.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
