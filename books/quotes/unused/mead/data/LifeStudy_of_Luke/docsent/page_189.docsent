   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shining the Word of Life as Luminaries Reflecting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Brightness of Jesus Christ, the God-man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we live Christ as the God-man, we should shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life Phil 2:15b-16a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is to shine as luminaries reflecting the brightness of Jesus Christ, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we cooperate with the operating God within us by obeying Him, the God-man as the pneumatic Christ with His bountiful supply will enable us to shine the word of life as luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of merely teaching or preaching, we shall be shining the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We shall be luminaries reflecting the brightness of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Found in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we live Christ as the God-man, we shall be found in Christ Phil 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As one who was the reproduction of the God-man, Paul desired to be found in Christ by all his observers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all His believers would discover him fully in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Him as Our Subjective Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A condition for being found in Christ is that we have Christ as our subjective righteousness, as our surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the righteousness referred to by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5:20: For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Righteousness here does not refer to the objective righteousness, which is the Christ we receive when we believe in Him so that we may be justified before God 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, it refers to the subjective righteousness which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Philippians 3:9 Paul calls this the righteousness which is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word for of means out of or out from.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This righteousness is actually God Himself lived out of us to be our righteousness through our faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such righteousness is the expression of God, who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the surpassing righteousness is God Himself living out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not our own righteousness; it is God as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Power of His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Philippians 3:10 Paul said, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse indicates that Paul lived Christ in the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul had been terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in the resurrection of Christ he enjoyed the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The power of Christ s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead Eph 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reality of the power of Christ s resurrection is the Spirit Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To know this power requires identification with Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Death is the base of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would experience the power of Christ s resurrection, we need to live a crucified life as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being identified with Christ s death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up so that His divine life may be expressed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Conformed to His Death</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Philippians 3:10 Paul also speaks of being conformed to Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be conformed to Christ s death is to take His death as the mold of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The mold of Christ s death refers to His continual putting to death of His human life so that He might live by the life of God John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our life should be conformed to such a mold dying to our human life to live the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we would be found in Christ and live Him as the God-man, we must be conformed to His death.</S>
