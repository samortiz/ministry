   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTING THINGS PASS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE HANDS OF OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The right way is this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the first day that I come here to serve, I may do ninety percent of the things and leave ten percent in the hands of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after one month, I am taking care of only sixty percent, and the other thirty percent has passed into the hands of some others who have come in to serve with me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After another month, I may take care of only thirty percent, and another month later, maybe only five percent, then a little later, only one percent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The rest of the job of the service goes to all the related brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One sister takes care of the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A brother takes care of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another takes care of this, and another takes care of that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To serve the Lord in this way I need to learn many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each one of us naturally thinks that he is the best and would never let others do the same thing he does.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself, how to be limited by others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, you could not bring people more and more into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was a sister in China who was quite capable, educated, and experienced in doing things, and she loved the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when she came into the service of the church, the more she served, the more everything came into her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After two or three months, it seemed that all the others had been dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day the elders asked her why it was that there were only two or three left in the Lord s service, when a few months ago there had been quite a number.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They asked where the others were.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Her answer was that they did not know how to do things, and they did not do them well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more she served, the more all the others were dismissed, dismissed because of her ability and her capability.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one could work as fast as she could.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In everything it seemed she was right because she was so capable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in spiritual reality she damaged the church life very much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She acted independently.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later on, with this sister there was a great spiritual cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A cancer is a part of the body that overdevelops, a group of cells that goes wild, that goes too far.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to be limited by others so that you will not be a cancer to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You need to be limited by others so that you will be a member coordinated with others, not a cell gone wild.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best way for us to serve the Lord in the church is this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first week that you come to serve the Lord, you may take care of seventy percent of the things, and the others take care of thirty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The next week, you take sixty-five percent, and the others thirty-five percent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third week, you may take sixty, and the others, forty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With you, the percentage is always being reduced, and with the others, it is always being increased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From another angle, the first week that you come, only five percent of the saints are serving with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After one week, there are eight percent, then twelve, twenty, and eventually, maybe after one year, one hundred percent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The percentage of the work in your hands is always being reduced, yet the number of the people serving with you is always increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After maybe one or two years, the service will be absolutely out of your hands and one hundred percent in the hands of all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The number of the serving ones will be increased from just a handful to more than a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you take this way, you will learn to be limited, to be broken, and to submit yourself to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you don t serve the Lord with others, you will never know yourself, but when you serve with others, you will be exposed how good you really are.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this kind of service there are many lessons for you to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>TESTED BY THE COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In my experience I have always been tested by the brothers in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kind of testing is very hard to take, but you simply need to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may tell the Lord, Lord, this is a cup from You, and I have no choice but to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way for you to learn the lesson of serving the Lord in the way of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you do things by yourself, it seems that everything is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when you do things with others, it seems that nothing is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, I would always prefer to travel by myself in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, in China, under the Lord s sovereignty and under the coordination for the co-workers, I always had to travel with two or more brothers and even to be the leader among them for the traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am a person who always likes to have everything ready ahead of time, to leave nothing to be done at the last minute, and I would urge the brothers to have everything prepared for our trip.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time there would be someone who was not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually I would have to help him get ready, take care of things for him, and do everything for him, and we would not be ready on time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I encouraged everyone to take responsibility for their own things and not to burden others, but whatever way I tried, nothing seemed to work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually I had to submit to the Lord and learn to be patient, and I had to take care of all the suitcases and all of the problems for the others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more people you have traveling with you, the more problems you have the luggage, the things others forget, all the special needs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have no choice but to help.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It seems that the others have come to help you, but you have to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They become a burden instead of a help, but they are really a help for you to learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One of the biggest problems is to go with several co-workers to visit a church and to be received for hospitality by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many co-workers simply do not know how to be guests.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are many problems and many lessons for us to learn in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What shall you do in all these situations?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You cannot dismiss your co-workers and send them home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You simply have to learn the lesson in the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the only way for you to serve the Lord with others, to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You should not be a giant.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You should not be the one who is on the top.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You always need to be coordinated with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you will try this way, you will surely see where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are always ready to dismiss others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When some matters of the service were assigned to certain brothers or sisters, many times they would say that they wanted to make it clear that no one should come to the place where they were to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If they were to do the cooking, they would insist that no one else come to the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the one hand, this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But on the other hand, they needed a few not only to help them but also to be a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Otherwise, there would be no lesson for them to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you have some helpers that are a burden to you in the service, then you will be limited, broken, and adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You need someone to be your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You may be too quick, and you need someone to burden you to slow you down.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then you will learn the lesson, and you will bring people in.</S>
