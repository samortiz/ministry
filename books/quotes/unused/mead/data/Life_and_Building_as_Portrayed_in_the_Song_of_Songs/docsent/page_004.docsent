   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE IS A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then what is life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Life is Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 11:25 and 14:6, Jesus says, "I am the life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 3:4 speaks of "Christ who is our life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life is a wonderful Person!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Simply to say that life is a Person is quite easy, but it takes time for us to get into the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The very life which we received when we believed in the Lord Jesus is a Person!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you know the difference between a person and a life?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With a person there is a personality with a will, desires, intentions, and emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But a life may not have all these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A tree has life, but this life has no personality, no will, no intention, and no desire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the life which we have received of the Lord Jesus is not a mere life; it is a Person!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a Person with a divine and a human personality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This Person has a will, an intention, and a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the life which we have received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THREE KINDS OF LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the Greek New Testament, there are three different kinds of lives: the bios physical life, the psuche psychological life, and the zoe eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must realize that the zoe life is not merely a life; it is a divine-human Person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is the unique Person with both the divine personality and the human personality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The zoe life which you received when you were saved is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE STRONGEST PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But with such a Person there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If zoe was merely a life, it would be easy to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But since the zoe life is a Person, we have some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simply to take a life is easy, but to take a Person is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I were just a mere life, it would be easy for you to deal with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in fact it is really difficult for you to deal with me because I am a person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The main problem between husbands and wives is that they are persons with different personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A man has a male personality, and a woman has a female personality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When two personalities are put together, there really is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If all the brothers' wives had no personality, it would be wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the problem is that each of our wives has a unique, strong personality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And the brothers' personalities are just as unique and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The problem always arises from the matter of personality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why life is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus, who is our life, is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not take Him as a Person, then we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we take life, we must take Him as a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 John 5:12 says, "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Son is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse does not say that he that has the life of the Son has life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It says that he that has the Son has life!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Person is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not take this Person, it will be rather difficult for us to get the life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The life is the Person!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If this vision could be wrought into us, it would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all must be clear that the zoe life is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, Christ is a Person with the strongest personality!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can be assured that His personality is much stronger than ours, and that it can never be subdued by ours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is waiting continually to subdue our personality with His.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Zoe is not merely a life without a personality, but a Person as life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we take zoe as our life, then surely we must take Jesus as our Person, because this life is a Person.</S>
