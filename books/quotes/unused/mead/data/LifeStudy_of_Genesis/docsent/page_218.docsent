   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Divided Eventually</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why, then, were the people divided?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were divided because they began to have different worships and because they had different goals, interests, and purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 10:31 reveals four ways in which the people were divided: according to their families; according to their languages, that is, according to their different words, concepts, understandings, and utterances; according to their different lands; and according to their different nations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let me say a little about each of these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does a family signify?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It signifies a relationship in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people do not care for God, for His purpose, or for His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They only care for their family.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why are they one with their family?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Simply because their family is composed of their relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is the same among the Lord's people today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many divisions have been caused by relationships in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every fleshly relationship is the start of a division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we may not be in the same family according to the flesh, we may have a fleshly relationship nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps you love a certain brother because he is the kind of person that you love, yet you may not love other kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you love certain people because they are the kind of people that you love, you are a fleshly family, forming relationships according to your fleshly taste.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in order to maintain genuine unity, we must overcome the fleshly relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another cause of division is language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Language not only means speech; it means the utterance of your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Language is the expression of your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Divisions may be caused by our differing understandings and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You hold one concept, I hold another, and a third person holds still another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, the three of us will speak different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we all may speak English, we each speak in our own way, talking in our own language.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will result in fighting and division.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have families because of our fleshly interests and we have languages because of different concepts and utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These different utterances cause fighting, and fighting brings in division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Look at Christian history.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning, many dear saints were absolutely one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, at a certain time some of those saints took in different concepts and began to speak differently; they began to talk a different language.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the history of the division in Christianity throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Language truly is a factor of division.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What do the lands signify?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They signify territories.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was young, I learned that the missionaries who went to my province preaching the same Lord and the same gospel held a conference in which they divided a part of that province among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They said that a certain territory belonged to the Southern Baptists and that other territories belonged to the Presbyterians, Open Brethren, etc. They divided that part of the country into four or five territories.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were strict about this, saying to those who encroached upon their territory, "Why do you come to our territory to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Don't you know that we have agreed to divide this part of the country into territories?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord has led us to release the matter of the church ground of locality in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ten years ago the church ground of locality was strongly opposed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now it has become a hot item on the market.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People are talking about the local church, and many are proclaiming that they are the local church in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, so many groups have not become local churches but local sects.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some have said to us, "We are the local church here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don't come to bother us."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Others say, "We are the local church here and we have the autonomy."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is this autonomy?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the dividing of the land for the sake of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When people say, "Don't bother us we are the local church in this locality," in God's sight they are a local sect, not a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today the divisive people will use any excuse to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yes, all the local churches are locally independent, yet universally they are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may say that there are many local churches, but we can never say that there are many bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although there may be a thousand local churches, the Body of Christ universally is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ does not have more than one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the brothers here in Anaheim would proclaim that they are the church in Anaheim and that others should not bother them, they immediately become a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have divided the land.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let us take the example of the United States, a nation composed of fifty states.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These fifty states are not divided lands.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can travel from one state to another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may be a citizen in California today and a citizen in Oregon tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A short while later you may move to Arizona and become a citizen there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although the United States is composed of fifty states, it is not divided into fifty lands.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once you have become a fleshly family, you will have an opinionated language and a divisive way of dividing the land.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, you will become a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is meaningful that in English the word denomination includes the word nation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In typology, it is a nation; in Christianity, it is a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A denomination means that which is denominated.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In typology there are the nations, such as Ethiopia, Egypt, Sheba, etc.; in Christianity there are the denominations, such as Lutheran, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, etc. All of these are nations or denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All are divided.</S>
