<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE RESTORATION OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</H2><P>After the fellowship of life is broken, we have to restore it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By the Confessing of Our Sins</H2><P>We have to confess our sins. First John 1:9 says that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. He forgives us according to His word faithfully and also according to the redemptive work of Christ righteously. Thus, by confessing our sins, our broken fellowship of life can surely be restored.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By the Cleansing of the Blood</H2><P>The confessing is on our side, and the cleansing is on God's side. If we confess, surely the blood cleanses us and the broken fellowship is always restored.</P><P>The focus of this message is as follows: the fellowship of life, being the flowing of the divine life, comes from the life of God and is preserved by the sense of life to supply us with the riches of the divine life.</P>
