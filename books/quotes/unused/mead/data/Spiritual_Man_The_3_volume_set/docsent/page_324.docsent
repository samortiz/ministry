   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Resisting is a real warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Resistance requires the combined strength of the spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the main part that must be exercised is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Deciding, choosing, and rejecting are all matters of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But resisting is a matter of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Resisting is the act that expresses the attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It involves a wrestling in the spirit and with the power of the spirit in which the will pushes out the ground that the evil spirits stand on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is an assault on the battleground of the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Resisting is a driving away, a chasing out, and a pushing aside with the power of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Evil spirits occupy the ground that the believer has given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they see the believer's attitude of opposition, they still occupy their original ground and will not retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To resist is for the believer to drive out evil spirits with "real power."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To resist is for the believer to "compel" the evil spirits and force them to be "evicted."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, when a believer is engaged in such a resisting work, he must exert his strength and exercise his will to drive out the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, a declaration in the attitude is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Practice must go side by side with attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, it is of little use to resist without also rejecting, because promises given to evil spirits at the beginning must be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the process of reclaiming the ground, the believer must decide with his will and choose and reject.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He must resist with his will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He must decide to fight the warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must choose freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must reject all ground and withstand the enemy from occupying further ground and taking away his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the midst of such decision, rejection, choosing, and withstanding, the believer is fighting for his sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never forget the matter of the free will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has given us a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we ought to be our own master.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet now, evil spirits have taken over our members and their functions and have become the masters of our "being."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have lost our sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a believer begins to reclaim his ground, he is opposing the evil spirits in their work of "replacing" him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, he has to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believer must continually declare that he will not allow evil spirits to infringe on his right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will not allow evil spirits to infringe on his personality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will not allow evil spirits to attach themselves to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will not allow evil spirits to take over his being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will not follow evil spirits blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will not!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will not!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will be his own master.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He wants to know what he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will take control of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He wants his whole being to be subject to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He rejects all the works of evil spirits on him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He rejects all their rights to work on him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he exercises his own will to utter his own decision, choice, and rejection, evil spirits will not be able to go on with their works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the will has decided, rejected, and chosen, he should follow up with the resistance of his will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the believer reclaims the ground with his will, his life will experience a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What was done wrongly is done.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now he has a fresh start.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He can reclaim all the things that he offered to evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His spirit, soul, and body must be taken back from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He should consecrate them once again to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the ground given to evil spirits through ignorance should be repudiated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the rights given to them should be taken back.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way is as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rejecting everything that he once received.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Departing from everything that he clung to.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Canceling everything that he scheduled.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Repealing everything that he promised.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not believing in anything that he believed in.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Destroying everything that he did before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Retracting everything that he said.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Dissolving everything that he joined himself to.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Speaking out on everything that he held silence on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Opposing everything that he cooperated with.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Refusing to give what he previously gave.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Overturning all previous considerations, discussions, and promises.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rejecting all previous prayers, answers, and healings.</S>
