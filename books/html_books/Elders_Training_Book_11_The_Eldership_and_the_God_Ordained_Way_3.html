Chapters one through eleven were previously published as individual messages in a series entitled Elders' Training and were given from February 23 through June 15, 1991. Chapters twelve and thirteen were previously published in a small book entitled Further Consideration of the Eldership, the Region of the Work, and the Care for the Body of Christ and were given on July 6-7, 1991.</P></td></tr></table></div><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WHAT IS THE CHURCH<br>TO GOD AND CHRIST?<br>AND<br>HOW SHOULD THE ELDERS<br>BE TO THE CHURCHES?</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-10; 1:9-10; James 1:18; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2-3; Eph. 5:2, 25-29; 3:4-6; Col. 2:2b; Eph. 5:32; Rev. 1:11-12, 20; Eph. 4:3-6; 1 Cor. 1:10-13a; Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 5:32; Acts 20:29, 17, 28; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1-2, 6-7; 1 Pet. 5:3; 1 Tim. 5:17; Rom. 12:8; 1 Thes. 5:12; Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 1 Pet. 5:2b, 4</H1><P>Our intention in this training is to fellowship not merely doctrinal matters but practical matters, matters which we need to practice, live, and carry out. In this chapter we want to see what the church is to God and Christ and how the elders should be to the churches. The church and the eldership may be very familiar to us, yet we need some basic realization and understanding concerning them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT THE CHURCH IS TO GOD AND CHRIST</H2><P>The church is familiar to all of us, but not many Christians can speak adequately concerning what the church is to God and to Christ. The New Testament, especially the most critical books of the New Testament, the heart of the divine revelation, reveal what the church is to God and to Christ. Much of the speaking concerning the church is very shallow. To be sure, it is too shallow to say that the church is a physical building. The Brethren taught that the church is not a physical building but a gathering of God's called-out people. This is good, but even this is somewhat shallow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Goal<br>of God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>First, the church is the goal of God's eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-10). Our God has a desire, His good pleasure, so He needed an economy, which He made within Himself in eternity past before the foundation of the world. Before time began, God in His divine trinity made an economy. Every economy has a goal. It is even the more so with God's economy. He has a goal, which is the church. In His economy He planned in His wisdom to have a church to accomplish and fulfill His heart's desire. The church is God's goal. If we are not clear concerning this, we must spend some time in the books of Ephesians and Colossians to see the church as the goal of God's economy and His heart's desire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Good Pleasure of God<br>for Heading Up All Things in Christ<br>through the Church as the Means</H2><P>Second, the church is the good pleasure of God for heading up all things in Christ through the church as the means (Eph. 1:9-10). When God was incarnated as the Man Jesus, He traveled and worked for three and a half years in Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. During this time He was simply carrying out His good pleasure. God created all things, but Satan overthrew them. The universe became overthrown, collapsed, corrupted, and confused, and all things were put in a wrong order. Satan became God's enemy, fighting against God. However, even this fighting is a part of the carrying out of God's good pleasure. Today our eyes are blessed. In these days I thank the Lord that we are not only reading about God's good pleasure, but we are now seeing it being carried out. Our God has a good pleasure to head up every part of His scattered creation in Christ through the channel of the church. The result will be the New Jerusalem in the new heavens and new earth. When God looks at this, He will see His good pleasure. The church is the means for God to gain His good pleasure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Firstfruit<br>of God's New Creation</H2><P>The church is also the firstfruit of God's new creation (James 1:18). God is gaining the new creation by transforming the old creation into something with a new nature. The church is the firstfruit of this new creation. The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church, Having Been Obtained<br>(Redeemed) by God with His Own Blood,<br>Being the Object of God's Love</H2><P>Fourth, the church, being the object of God's love, was obtained, that is, redeemed, by God with His own blood (Acts 20:28). The blood shed by Jesus on the cross was God's own blood. God shed His own blood to pay the cost for the church in order to redeem it. The church became and still is the object of God's love. God's love needs an object. The wife is the object of the husband's love. In the Bible the romance between male and female is used to illustrate God's divine romance. The church is the female in this romance, that is, the object of the divine love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Flock of God<br>as God's Possession, Allotted to the Elders<br>for Their Care</H2><P>The church is also the flock of God as God's possession, allotted to the elders for their care (1 Pet. 5:2-3). The local churches are the flock of God, His possession, His inheritance. He has allotted this inheritance to the elders, who are the trustees. God's possession is given to the elders for their care.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church as Both the Body<br>and the Bride of Christ,<br>Being the Object of Christ's Love</H2><P>The church, as both the Body and the bride of Christ, is the object of Christ's love (Eph. 5:2, 25-29). Ephesians 5:29 says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church." The church is the Body of Christ. As His Body, the church becomes His counterpart, His bride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Mystery of Christ,<br>as Christ is the Mystery of God,<br>Both of Which Are the Great Mystery</H2><P>The church is also the mystery of Christ, as Christ is the mystery of God (Eph. 3:4-6; Col 2:2b). Both of these mysteries are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32). Christ is a mystery, and His mystery is the church. If we are to know the mystery of Christ, we have to know the church. The church is the mystery of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Local Churches Being the Lampstands<br>(the Local Testimony) of Christ</H2><P>The local churches are the lampstands, the local testimony, of Christ (Rev. 1:11-12, 20). Each local church is a testimony of Christ in its locality. Christ is the testimony, the expression of God, and the church is the testimony, the expression of Christ. A local church is a testimony, a "photograph," of Christ. This "photograph," this picture, is better than a thousand words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church as the Body of Christ<br>Being Uniquely One Both Universally and Locally</H2><P>The church as the Body of Christ is uniquely one both universally and locally (Eph 4:3-6). The church is one universally as the Body of Christ and one locally as the local testimony, the expression of Christ. As the local testimonies, the churches are many, but in each city there should only be one local church as Christ's unique expression in that locality. The church, both universally and locally, has only one Head. The church also has one Spirit (Eph. 4:4), that is, one life, one Lord (4:5), and one God, the Father of all (4:6).</P><P>Christ is unique and is not divided (1 Cor. 1:13a). This unique and undivided Christ, taken as the unique center among all the believers, should be the termination of all divisions. All the elders must see this. Some people say that as long as we love the Lord and live Him, we can serve Him properly regardless of what ground we stand on. To these persons, it does not mean much whether there is one church or thirty "churches" in their locality. They say that we have to exercise generality and broaden our heart. To them, as long as people love the Lord, serve the Lord, and even live the Lord, it is not wrong for them to meet in their own way. What would you say to them? Paul says, "Has Christ been divided?" (1 Cor. 1:13a). There is no need to speak too many words concerning this matter. We should simply ask them, "Has Christ been divided? If not, then why are you divided?" There is the need of such a basic realization and understanding of the church. The elders, especially those who are somewhat new in the eldership, should get into all these points that they may know the church. Then they will know the truth, and their understanding, their attitude, and their standing, their ground, will be upright. To be elders caring for God's allotment, we need to know the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW THE ELDERS SHOULD BE TO THE CHURCHES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Needing to Have a Vision concerning the Church</H2><P>The elders need to have a vision concerning the church (Matt. 16:16-18; Eph. 5:32). They need a vision to see all the foregoing items in this message. For over fifty-eight years the tone of this ministry has never changed because of the vision we have received. We have never changed our speaking despite all the turmoils in the church. Instead, all the turmoils have strengthened our faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Needing to Love the Church as the Flock of God</H2><P>The elders also need to love the church as the flock of God (Acts 20:29). The church is God's flock, and the elders are those appointed by God to care for the flock. As such, the elders need to love the church. We should love the church as a mother loves her own children (1 Thes. 2:7). In taking care of a church we should never take the way of legality. If we take the legal way, we will bring trouble to ourselves. Love is the only way that can build up the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being the Overseers in the Church Life</H2><P>The elders are the overseers in the church life (Acts 20:17, 28a; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1-2, 6-7). An elder is a person of maturity, whereas an overseer refers to the function of an elder. The responsibility and function of an elder is to oversee the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being the Rulers of the Church,<br>Lording It over the Church,<br>but Being Patterns of the Flock,<br>Taking the Lead in the Church Life</H2><P>The elders are not the rulers of the church, lording it over the church, but rather patterns of the flock, taking the lead in the church life (1 Pet. 5:3; 1 Tim. 5:17; Rom. 12:8; 1 Thes. 5:12). The elders are overseers but not rulers. If a matter is taken care of in the wrong way, the elders should not correct too strongly by rebuking but should simply take care of it in the right way. In this way, everyone will see the proper way to do it. They must not lord it over or rule over the situation. If a rest room has not been cleaned well, an elder should not blame or complain. Rather, because he is an overseer, he has seen it, and he can silently clean it in a better way. This is the proper way. An overseer is not a ruler but a pattern. If a proper pattern has not been built up, the overseer should build it up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Serving Not by Way of Compulsion, but Willingly,<br>according to God; Not Seeking Gain<br>by Base Means, but Eagerly</H2><P>The elders serve not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly (1 Pet. 5:2b). Because the church is God's allotment and is where the elders' love is, whatever they say and do for the church and in the church is not something done by compulsion. This is the way with parents, especially with mothers. The best mothers never complain. They are always willing. The elders serve willingly and eagerly, according to God. They should not serve in the way of seeking gain by base means. The elders should not care for money. They should simply be for the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Needing to Be the Lord's Messengers<br>as Shining Stars</H2><P>The elders need to be the Lord's messengers as shining stars (Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). A messenger is one that brings a message from the Lord to His people. Every elder should be one that always speaks for the Lord and brings some word, some message, from the Lord. The elders also should be the shining stars. To say that there should not be elders in the church is anarchy. However, it is wrong for some to be elders legally, simply according to the letter. Some elders may not have a proper knowledge of the Lord's heart and may not have a message, a word, from the Lord to the church. This kind of elder is not adequate. An elder must be apt to teach (1 Tim. 3:2). To be apt to teach is to bring a word, a message, from the Lord to His people. One who does this is a messenger. Such a one is not simply speaking with his mouth, but also shining by what he does and what he is. The messenger himself is a star. A star simply shines. On the one hand, we need to be messengers, and on the other hand, we need to be the shining stars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Reward to the Elders</H2><P>The reward to the elders will be the unfading crown of glory, which they will receive at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4). In 1 Peter 5 there is a great promise concerning the reward to the elders. At the apostles' time, crowns were given to victors in athletic games and warfare (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given by the Lord to the faithful elders will be a reward for their loyal service. The glory of the crown will never fade. It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ (2 Pet. 1:11).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ELDERS' INTEREST (CONCERN)<br>IN OTHERS' SPIRITUAL WELFARE</H1><P>Not only the elders but also all the believers, every saved one, should have a proper interest in people, a proper concern in others' spiritual welfare. We should always be very concerned for our fellow members, and we should lead the new ones among us into the same condition of concern. When the new ones were saved, they realized that their salvation came to them through some Christians who were concerned for them. If no one had ever been concerned for them, some of them may never have heard the Lord's name and would not have been saved. Some, however, did hear the Lord's name and even studied in Christian schools all their lives, but they were not saved because no one had ever had a concern for them in their spiritual welfare. We Christians, especially the elders, must be those always concerned for others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING CONCERNED FOR PEOPLE<br>RATHER THAN FOR BUSINESS AFFAIRS</H2><P>Through my experience in caring for the churches in Chefoo and Shanghai, I know that the elders are very busy. There are many affairs to take care of in the church life. This is why a proper church life needs the deacons, the serving ones. The elders should assign the business of the church to the deacons and deaconesses, the brothers and sisters who serve the church in the business affairs. The first responsibility of the elders is to always have an interest and concern for others' spiritual welfare. When I contact the brothers who are elders and learn that they are very busy in business affairs, I am disappointed. When the elders are very involved with the church's business affairs, the church does not have a promising future. It is better that the elders spend most of their time to contact people. It is better that their heart not be in the affairs but on people. They should be concerned for people, have an interest in people, and be fully occupied with people.</P><P>The elders' portion concerning the business affairs is simply to manage them, not to take care of them. In describing the responsibility of the elders, the New Testament uses the words manage (1 Tim. 3:4-5) and overseer (1 Tim. 3:2). The elders should not care for the business affairs directly. Rather, they should manage them. In a corporation the general manager does not do the accounting or many other jobs; he simply manages them and assigns them to his employees. In the same way, the elders should manage the affairs and assign the various duties to others.</P><P>None of the business affairs should be carried out directly by the elders. However, in some churches the elders not only do the accounting but also do many other jobs. The accounting and bookkeeping should not be in the elders' hands. They should be assigned under the management of the eldership to a certain person or persons. Some saints should take care of the accounting, some should care for the bookkeeping, and some should take care of the other records, but the hands of the elders should be filled with people. This is the proper principle. The elders should pick up the habit to care for people and seek the help of others for the business affairs. In the church life, there are many practical matters that need attention. The elders cannot care for them by themselves. They must learn how to assign all these matters to others. The hands of the elders should be filled with people. They must learn to be concerned for people.</P><P>The elders must also learn to contact people. According to my observation and experience, an elder could contact about one hundred persons a month. This means he would contact about three or four persons daily. Many of the elders are not full-timers. Therefore, they must budget their time. Every day they should live according to a schedule. If one is a professor in a school, he does not need to resign. He can keep his job, but he must budget his time to contact people each day. An elder in a local church must budget his time to contact at least two people a day. The elders should contact all kinds of people, including unbelievers, new believers, and weak believers. The elders must pick up a burden to contact people in this way and to assign all the business affairs to the serving ones. This will save the elders from the business of the church so that they can care for people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LABORING IN THE WORD</H2><P>In 1 Timothy 5:17, Paul speaks of those elders "who labor in word and teaching." Paul's word is very inclusive. Laboring in the word does not merely mean to speak the word to others. It also means that the elders have to learn the Word. Paul set himself up as a good pattern in this regard. Even when he wrote his Epistles to Timothy, he was still learning. If he had not learned the Word, he could not have known Leviticus, as indicated by the book of Hebrews. At that time, to know the five books of Moses was not easy. Likewise today, to know the New Testament is not easy.</P><P>I have spent close to forty years speaking on Christ as life and the enjoyment and experience of Christ. Hundreds of messages on Christ as life have been given and printed, but I am concerned that many elders among us have not come into a full, thorough view concerning Christ as our life. Many messages concerning the Spirit, the economy of God, and the dispensing of God have been released, but many have not entered into them. We must bear the burden to take care of people in spiritual matters. However, if we do not learn the spiritual things, we will not know how to care for them. Therefore, there is the need to labor in the word.</P><P>To labor in the word not only means to minister the word. Before ministering the word, we have to know the Word. This requires much learning, and learning requires much time. Because of this, some elders need to be full-time. Paul indicated in 1 Timothy 5:17 that some of the elders were full-timers, because they were worthy of "double honor," which includes material supply. I would encourage some of the elders to go full-time to take care of the church, but this does not mean that every elder should be a full-timer. The principle is that all the elders should labor in the word and learn in order to be good ministers of Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 4:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT HAVING AN INTEREST<br>IN KNOWING OTHERS' AFFAIRS, WHICH<br>SPREADS DEATH IN THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>The elders' interest in others' spiritual welfare is not an interest in knowing their affairs. To know others' affairs is a temptation. It is better to be a "dove" among the saints, without any intention of seeing or hearing of others' affairs. The interest in knowing others' affairs spreads spiritual death in the church. If there were no knowing of others' affairs among the churches, there would be no gossiping, and if there were no gossiping, there would be no "killing."</P><P>It is difficult to know one's affairs accurately. When something is told to one person and is spread from that person to others, it becomes inaccurate. Thus, many words concerning the saints' affairs become false words. The best way is not to know others' affairs. We may need to know certain things for the purpose of interceding for others, but we must try our best to know the matters accurately by going to that person and listening to them directly. Except for interceding in this way, knowing others' affairs is always a temptation. To know others' affairs is not the real interest and concern for people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING AN INTEREST CONCERNING PEOPLE'S CONDITION WITH THE LORD, WHICH MINISTERS LIFE IN THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>The interest in others' spiritual welfare is the interest concerning people's condition with the Lord, which ministers life in the organic building up of the Body of Christ. We cannot know people's condition with the Lord except by a direct contact with them. No one can know someone's real condition unless he contacts him a number of times. We must contact someone again and again, until he has a trust in us and will open up the things on his heart. Without this, we cannot know his real condition.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING BURDENED WITH THE CONTACTING OF PEOPLE<br>FOR THE LORD'S KINGDOM</H2><P>The elders must be burdened with the contacting of people for the Lord's kingdom. It is not sufficient merely to be concerned for people. The elders must pick up the burden to contact people. This contact is not in a general way nor in an indifferent way. To contact someone in a general or indifferent way is meaningless and a waste of time. Our contacting of people must be in a particular way that concerns their spiritual life. We must speak with others about particular matters. After several contacts with an unbelieving person, we can eventually tell him that we have a real concern about his salvation.</P><P>We must first learn to open up ourselves to the ones whom we contact. This opening will cause them to open up to us. When the elders go to contact people, or when people come to contact them, they must take the lead to open themselves up in order to gain the credit of the ones they contact. We must learn to be very open to people. The contact we have with people is always based upon our opening to them. However, our opening to them should be with wisdom. Otherwise, we will be foolish and will cause trouble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO PRAY WITH A PARTICULAR BURDEN<br>FOR THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LORD<br>OF THOSE FOR WHOM YOU ARE CONCERNED</H2><P>The elders must also learn to pray with a particular burden for the relationship with the Lord of those for whom they are concerned. This praying is not in the way of convenience for the elders. Rather, this praying should be in the way of a proper schedule. We must have a schedule with a proper budget of our time. This schedule should include a time to pray for the ones we contact.</P><P>If the elders take the way we have fellowshipped here, they will be very approachable. It will be easy for people to contact them. All the elders should learn to contact people. The elders should save their time from meaningless telephone calls and conversations. Many of us waste much of our time by unnecessary contacts, meaningless talk, and phone calls. We must change our way of living. The elders should schedule their time in a very narrow and strict way. In this way, they can fulfill their responsibility in the eldership. Without contacting people, they will have no way to fulfill their responsibility.</P><P>The condition of a church depends upon the eldership in that church. The proper eldership is one in which all the elders contact people daily, weekly, regularly, and consistently. The number of people the elders contact is the deciding factor of the condition of the church in their locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BUILDING UP A HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</H2><P>We must first pick up a concern for people and go to contact them. Then we will learn their condition. In a local church the first thing that is needed is for the elders to contact people. It is very convenient, profitable, and necessary for them to contact people, especially the new ones, before and after the meetings. However, many of the elders have not picked up this habit. There may be many new ones in the meetings, but the elders do nothing to contact them after the meetings. Contacting people must be our priority in the church life.</P><P>If we have the practice and a strong habit of going out to contact unbelievers for the increase according to a schedule, others will know us to be those who are always busy gaining new ones. If we are such persons, others will be helped to go out with us to preach the gospel. We are not a society to take care of people's social problems. This is not our way. We are here to save people, to gain new ones, and to help people to grow.</P><P>The way we practice the church life is our basic problem. Nearly all the elders have accepted in theory the God-ordained way to meet and serve, but many do not practice it. Those brothers who are elders must consider this situation. We must practice what we believe. We must practice going out to gain new ones in a desperate way, contacting people for their salvation. We must go to contact people. To get one person saved and to bring that person into the church life is not an easy matter. It requires us to pay the price.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PURPOSE OF THE ELDERS'<br>CONTACT WITH PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31; Gal. 6:1; Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28; John 4:15</H1><P>As we have seen in the previous chapter, the elders must be apt to contact people and must build up the habit of contacting people. The elders must be interested in people and have much concern for them. In this chapter we shall fellowship concerning the purpose of the elders' contact with people. The purpose of the elders' contact with people is related to the God-ordained way to meet and to serve. The God-ordained way is firstly to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, that is, to bear the burden to spread the gospel to get sinners saved. Then, it is to feed the young ones and to raise them up. We must not only feed the new ones but also raise them as we would raise a family. Lastly, the God-ordained way is to train the new ones to prophesy for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTACTING PEOPLE IN ORDER TO GAIN THEM<br>FOR THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is to gain people for the increase of the kingdom of God. Matthew 28:19 says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." To disciple the nations is not merely to help sinners to have their sins forgiven and be saved. It is to bring them into the kingdom, making them citizens of the kingdom of God.</P><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the feeding and the raising up of the new members of the Body of Christ (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7). After we gain people and disciple them into the kingdom, we have to feed them and raise them up as the new members of the Body of Christ. We have to endeavor to feed the new ones and raise them up, so that they may be the practical members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:12). To perfect the saints is to train and equip them. After a young person graduates from high school, he must learn a trade or go to college. To learn a trade or a skill is to be perfected. We all must be impressed that each one among us has a special spiritual "trade." The new ones must be saved, nourished, and raised up. At the same time, they need to be trained to pick up a spiritual trade. We may say that every member of our physical body has a "trade." When a baby is born, he has all his members, but the members do not all function skillfully. They have not learned their trade. While a mother cares for her child, she trains him, and after a number of years, all his members function properly. This is what it means to be perfected and equipped.</P><P>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also for the building up of the organic Body of Christ through prophesying (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31). Some among the elders may say that to carry out the above points is too difficult. However, they should not be disappointed. The spiritual, divine life within us has an unlimited capacity. If we will exercise, we will learn our spiritual trade and will have the ability to carry out the eldership. However, without exercise we will not be able to learn. A young lady may not have been taught how to cook or to raise children, but after being married for a while, she can learn to cook and eventually learn how to raise a family. She picks up these skills by practicing. In the same way, learning to be a proper elder is a matter of exercise and practice.</P><P>The elders in a local church may feel that they are not adequate to be proper elders. However, if they are faithful for a period of time, they will learn much. When we exercise, our capacity is manifested and developed. Then we will know how to be elders. Developing our capacity may be illustrated by the acquiring of an education in school. In society a young person needs eighteen or more years of education. After graduation from high school, a person may study for four more years in college and then several more years for an advanced degree. To be educated in this way is to be developed. We have the capacity to do many things. However, we need education and practice to develop our capacity. Even making mistakes is an education for the elders. The more mistakes the elders make, the more they will learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT THROUGH REBUKE OR CONDEMNATION<br>WITH ANY KIND OF NEGATIVE SPIRIT,<br>ATTITUDE, AND TONE</H2><P>As we have seen, the purpose of the elders' contact with people is to gain them for the increase of the kingdom of God, for the feeding and raising up, for the perfecting of the saints, and for the building up of the Body of Christ through prophesying. Our gaining of people, however, should not be through rebuke or condemnation with any kind of negative spirit, attitude, and tone. To be a good elder, the first thing one must learn is not to rebuke people. Through many mistakes, we have learned that rebuking never works. For this reason, Paul said, "And the fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord" (Eph. 6:4). If we do not rebuke our children when we discipline them, we will not provoke them. Provoking comes from rebuking. If a child misbehaves and we rebuke him, he will be provoked. Instead, we should spend a pleasant time with him, and in this time we will be able to pass on the proper knowledge of how to behave.</P><P>In our experience, we have discovered that there are two extremes among the elders. The first is that the elders may be those who apparently are so good. They never seem to see or hear of anything negative related to the saints. They prefer to say, "Hallelujah, praise the Lord!" to every situation. These elders are sloppy, defeated, and unprofitable. The other extreme is among those elders who are very responsible. Every responsible elder is keen and sharp. These elders take Paul's word concerning the overseers (1 Tim. 3:1-2) and say that they must oversee how the saints are going on. It is very easy for such elders to condemn others. The elders, however, should not condemn the persons whom they contact. They should not be sloppy, but they must also not be keen in a way that leads them to condemn others. An elder that can do many things in the church without being at one extreme or the other is a successful elder. An elder needs to be one who does things without being anything. Such an elder does not rebuke or condemn. He is neither sloppy, loose, or idle, nor sharp, keen, and frank in a condemning way.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians, Paul strongly rebuked the believers in Corinth. In doing this, however, he had affliction and anguish of heart (2 Cor. 2:4). Moreover, he had no relief in his spirit until the good news came through Titus, telling him of the Corinthians' positive response (7:6). At that time the great burden in his heart was relieved. This indicates that there was a danger in Paul's rebuke to the believers. The Lord Jesus at times also strongly rebuked certain people. However, we are not the Lord Jesus. He surely knew how much to rebuke people and when to do it. We, however, have often rebuked people foolishly. Nothing exposes our foolishness as much as our rebuking. The more we rebuke people, the more foolish we are. We are one with Christ, but only to a partial degree. We are still too much in the old man, in the natural life. Unconsciously and unintentionally we often do the wrong things together with the right things. Therefore, it is always safer not to rebuke.</P><P>Brother Nee testified that he received much help from Sister M.E. Barber, who rebuked him often. She was very deep in the Lord and had especially learned the lesson of the subjective cross of Christ. She learned the lesson of bearing the cross, and she learned the lesson of praying and of living in the light of the Lord's appearing. However, her shortcoming was in the matter of frankness and rebuking. Although she was in China for many years, only one person, Watchman Nee, was raised up through her. According to Brother Nee, there were over twenty young people under her care, but eventually nearly all left. Only Brother Nee continued to return to her to be rebuked.</P><P>The problems in a church are often related to the elders, and most of the problems related to the elders arise from the elders' negative spirit, attitude, and tone toward others. It is very difficult not to have a negative spirit. Our spirit, attitude, tone, and gesture may all offend people. Therefore, the elders should be grave, having a weightiness that inspires and invites honor. This depends upon their spirit, attitude, tone, and gesture. Even our listening to people without responding to them properly may offend them. The elders should learn the proper way to listen to others and to respond to them. Not responding properly to people comes from a negative spirit.</P><P>The elders must be happy persons with a joyful spirit, always humble, mild, and easy to contact. No one on earth is perfect. Everyone needs the Lord. Therefore, regardless of what someone says, the elders should not be bothered by that person. They must realize that this person needs the Lord, and they must be happy with him and try to give him an "injection" of Christ. This is to dispense Christ into this person.</P><P>An elder must be full of discernment; he should not be foolish or dull. However, he should discern without criticizing, despising, and judging. This is not easy. He must have a keen feeling about others, but he should not criticize or despise them. It is wrong to have a despising attitude toward someone because we know him well. Even if an elder knows others' shortcomings, he must not criticize, despise, or judge them. The elder himself also has shortcomings. In this sense, he is the same as the others; it is simply a matter of degree. The elders should realize that they have their own mistakes. They have to turn their eyes upon themselves and consider themselves. They are not qualified to condemn or judge. However, by their appointment, the elders have been put into a position in which it is easy to criticize, despise, and judge, and because they are in such a position, it is easy for others to criticize them. These are the snares, the traps, which Satan has set around the elders. Almost no elder can escape these traps. It is difficult to be an elder in a local church for several years without being trapped by these snares.</P><P>The elders should contact people in a way that is full of love, concern, and sympathy in a meek and humble spirit (Gal. 6:1), not in a way to convince, to catch, to arrest, but to recover, to bring people back to the Lord. Their contact should be with the full realization that what the people need is the Lord and what can solve the people's problems is to meet with the Lord. In their contact with others, they should avoid a superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation, always remembering well that the church is neither a police station nor a law court, and that we are neither the policemen nor the judges.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MINISTERING CHRIST TO MEET THE NEED<br>OF EVERY KIND OF PERSON</H2><P>In their contact with people, the elders should minister Christ to meet the need of every kind of person (Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28). They must seek a way to get people to open to them. They must also find the proper utterance to touch people's spirit and catch the proper time to dispense Christ, either with a quotation from the Bible or a word of their inspiration. Lastly, they must stir up people's hunger and thirst to seek the Lord by praying with them (John 4:15).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PURPOSE OF THE ELDERS'<br>CONTACT WITH PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31; Gal. 6:1; Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28; John 4:15</H1><P>In this chapter we shall continue to fellowship concerning the purpose of the elders' contact with people. To contact people in a proper way is not easy. It is important for us to know the purpose of our contact with others. Many Christians contact people for the Lord, but they do not know what the purpose of their contact with others should be. Some today preach the gospel for the purpose of carrying out a social work. However, if we gain people in order to carry out a social work, we will miss the Lord's purpose in gaining them. The proper purpose in gaining people is firstly that they may be regenerated for the increase of the kingdom of God (Matt. 28:19). Then it is the feeding and the raising up of the new members of the Body of Christ (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7). Thirdly, it is the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:12). We gain people to perfect them to grow in life and develop their spiritual talents, their spiritual gifts, that they may be functioning members in the Body of Christ. Finally, our purpose in contacting others is to help them to learn how to speak for the Lord, to prophesy, for the building up of the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31). This is a heavenly, divine, and spiritual purpose, a purpose that is related to God's economy and the spiritual warfare against the power of darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED<br>OF TRANSFORMATION<br>FOR OUR CONTACT WITH PEOPLE</H2><P>If we see what the purpose of contacting people is, we will realize that we are short in our contact with others. This is because we were not raised and educated to contact people in this way. To contact people in this way is not in our thought, habit, or consideration. Therefore, we must be transformed. In Romans 12, when Paul desired to help the saints in the church to be built up to be living and functioning members, he first said, "And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind" (v. 2). Regardless of what we are, if we touch the building up of the Body of Christ, our entire being must be transformed. To be transformed does not mean merely to have a change. To be transformed is to be reconstituted. Our being is our human constitution, which comes from our birth, our education, our practices, and our habit. We need to be transformed, that is, to be reconstituted.</P><P>An elder may be a very good gentleman according to his natural being. However, what we are in a natural way means nothing. It is not useful, and we must not use it to build up the church. In regard to the building up of the Body of Christ, we should have no trust in what we are naturally. Rather, we must be transformed, reconstituted. We need to be remade, created anew. Even this elders' training should not be merely a training; it should be a reconstituting.</P><P>We should not contact people according to our old way. Even our experience in the church is not trustworthy, because in our experience many habitual things have been constituted into our being. The absolute requirement for an elder is that he must be another person. As long as one is an elder and desires to be a good elder, he must be reconstituted. He must present himself to the Lord for the Lord's reconstituting work. We all need to be reminded of this. All the points in this and the previous message should remind us of how we must be reconstituted to contact people in a proper way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MINISTERING LIFE TO OTHERS OUTSIDE OF THE REALM<br>OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</H2><P>Immediately after the creation of man, God placed man in front of two trees (Gen. 2:8-9). The first tree was the tree of life, and the second tree was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If we are to serve the Lord in a deeper way, we must know that both good and evil are versus life. In our contact with people, we should not help them merely to distinguish between good and evil. Rather, we should minister life to them to save them out of the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. The most tempting thing for the elders is the knowledge of good and evil, of who is right and who is wrong. When people come to the elders, the elders may be tempted to "measure" them to see whether or not they are up to a proper standard, that is, whether they are right or wrong, good or evil. When people come to us, we are accustomed to being full of the knowledge of good and evil. We may feel that we know what it is to be right or wrong in the church and among the saints. As a result, what is in us in our contact with those who come to us is in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. If this is our case, we have been tempted already. We have left the realm of life. We should not measure others in this way.</P><P>Brother Nee told us that the best way to contact people is to sense their spirit. However, he also told us that our way of understanding this was still in the realm of good and evil. We were still discerning people's spirit in the realm of good and evil. When people come to contact us, we should not remain in the realm, sphere, or kingdom of good and evil. We should remain in our spirit, in the kingdom of life. When a person speaks, we must discern what he says, not in the realm of who is right or wrong, good or evil, but in the realm of life. If we remain in the realm of good and evil, we cannot properly sense people's spirit.</P><P>If a certain brother comes and speaks with us, we may discern that he is natural and not spiritual. This may be correct, but our feeling should indicate to us that we are still in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. This is a great temptation. We may even become offended with such a brother and not desire to speak further with him. If this happens, we will lose the opportunity to minister life to him. If we remain in the realm of good and evil and become offended with the brother, we will be unhappy with each other and there will be no life in our contact. Rather, our contact will cause us to have a negative impression of the brother, which we may one day express. Eventually we may say something negative about him to someone else, and this gossip will spread death. Many times such a thing transpires in the church life. It is because we are tempted by the knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong. However, if we remain in the spirit rather than in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil, we will minister life to him in a pure and direct way. Then we will be saved from the realm of good and evil, and we will help the brother also to be saved from this realm. The result of our contact will be very helpful.</P><P>We may be aware of the temptation extended to Eve by Satan, but we may not realize that every day we are under the temptation to contact others in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. We must be full of discernment but outside of the realm of good and evil without criticizing, despising, and judging others. If we are in the spirit, full of life, we will be full of discernment, but we will have no criticizing, despising, or judging. We will simply minister life to those whom we contact. We will be able to minister life to anyone who comes to us because we will not care to remain in the realm of good and evil.</P><P>This is not easy, especially when a case between two parties comes to the elders. In such a case the elders often measure and weigh the case to see who is right and who is wrong. This is a temptation. If the elders determine that one of the parties is wrong, they may condemn him inwardly, and in their talk with him they may not be able to avoid criticizing and judging him. This spoils the situation. The elders may then ask the other party to exercise his patience while they do their best to help the first person to have a change and be adjusted. Such a way of speaking with the two parties is in the realm of good and evil. No life is ministered to either person under the cross. Rather, the negative situation may be intensified.</P><P>If we are humble and see our past in the light of this word, we will realize that many times we have fallen into this temptation and did not do anything to help the church in life. If we know the devices of Satan, we will not intensify a negative situation and cause it to be built into a worse issue. Rather, we will help both parties to realize that they are short of life. This will help them. Whether or not we can do this depends on whether we are persons in the realm of good and evil or in the realm of life. We must not care for anything good or anything bad. We must only care for Christ as life to us through the dealing of the cross. Then we will be able to minister Christ as life to whoever comes to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FULL OF LOVE, CONCERN, AND SYMPATHY<br>IN A MEEK AND HUMBLE SPIRIT,<br>WITH THE FULL REALIZATION THAT<br>WHAT PEOPLE NEED IS THE LORD<br>AND WHAT CAN SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM<br>IS TO MEET WITH THE LORD</H2><P>In their contact with people, the elders must be full of love, concern, and sympathy in a meek and humble spirit (Gal. 6:1). Only a reconstituted person can be like this. Any negative case in the church life is an exhausting matter. Visiting the persons involved in an issue and determining who is right and who is wrong exhausts the elders' time and energy. In such a situation, natural love, natural concern, natural kindness, and natural sympathy cannot last. The saints cannot be helped by us unless we have a real love, concern, and sympathy for them in the Lord. Otherwise, a small issue may be built into a major case in the church, like a small hill becoming a great mountain. Regardless of who comes to us, we should wait for a chance to minister Christ to them. Whether they are right or wrong, they are short of Christ. In the elders' contact with people, they must have the full realization that what the people need is the Lord and what can solve the people's problem is to meet with the Lord.</P><P>It is not only a temptation but also a snare of Satan to try to deal in the realm of good and evil with a difficult case between two parties. When one of the parties speaks with us, we should simply minister Christ the Lord to him. Eventually, the brother may realize that he is short of Christ. He will repent and receive more of the Lord, and by receiving Christ, his problem will be cared for. However, many of us upon hearing of a situation may simply charge the persons involved to be patient and exercise their love. If someone receives this kind of help, they may thank us and try to put it into practice. After a short time, however, they may come back to say that this way does not work. The more they try to be patient, the worse the situation gets. In this situation, both we and the two parties involved have been snared by Satan. The way to get out of the snare is to minister Christ to the persons and help them to realize they are short of Christ. Spontaneously, their case will be solved. The way of ministering Christ has been tested, and it always works. We all must realize that we are short of Christ. This is our problem.</P><P>We must be rescued out of the realm of good and evil and must remain in the realm of life. If we are full of Christ, we will be reconstituted persons. We will be full of love and concern. We will sympathize with the persons whom we contact because they are short of Christ, and we will have a real concern to minister Christ to them. This is the real love. We will not care who is right and who is wrong. We will not live in that kingdom; we will live in another kingdom, the kingdom of life. When any case among the saints is brought to us, we will not be snared by the realm of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTACTING PEOPLE NOT TO CONVINCE,<br>TO CATCH, OR TO ARREST, BUT TO RECOVER,<br>TO BRING PEOPLE BACK TO THE LORD</H2><P>The elders' contact with people is not to convince, to catch, or to arrest, but to recover, to bring people back to the Lord (Gal. 6:1). The elders are not policemen sent by the Lord to catch people and arrest them. Rather, they are sent to recover, to bring people back to the Lord. Sometimes the elders catch and arrest people by convincing them that they are wrong. This is to care for a case in the realm of good and evil. To do this is to fall into Satan's snare as Eve did. Once the elders are snared in this way, they cannot solve the case at hand. Rather, they become negatively involved. Whereas there were only two or three parties involved in the problem at first, now the elders have become parties involved in the problem. The reason for this trouble is that everyone was snared in the realm of good and evil.</P><P>When the leading ones in the church listen to a case, they must remember not to be snared by the knowledge of good and evil. They should realize that all the members, including themselves, need more Christ. The best way to get others out of the snare of the realm of good and evil is not to touch good and evil but minister Christ as life to them through the cross. In the past fifty-eight years, I have seen many cases in the church. Not one was properly solved by the judgment of good and evil. Once the elders make an issue of good and evil, a problem cannot be properly solved. We all must learn that when we contact people, we must stay away from the knowledge of good and evil. We must always remain in the Lord, realizing that what we and others need is the ministry of Christ. Our problem is the shortage of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SHEPHERDING THE SAINTS<br>BY CONTACTING THEM REPEATEDLY</H2><P>The elders must have the experience of Christ as life so they will know how to help others. When someone is in need, they should contact him several times, but they should not touch the matter of who is wrong and who is right. They must also not be hasty in helping him. They should not be disappointed after the first contact. Often the first contact may not be very helpful. However, they should continue to go to the person in need. This is to shepherd the saints. Perhaps on the first visit there will be no opportunity to minister anything, but eventually the elders will be able to minister Christ to the person involved. They will help him contact the Lord, and eventually they may have a chance to pray with him and bring him to the Lord in that prayer. Then he will touch the Lord, and once he touches the Lord, his problem will be cared for in the Lord.</P><P>When a local church has been established for a period of time, there will be some saints who do not come to the meetings. If we consider those who do not come, we will find that most of them have certain problems. Therefore, there is the need to shepherd them, to go to them again and again. We should not consider that to go to the weaker ones is a waste of time. Rather, this is the way to keep the existing members in the church. We should not expect that we can help them by one visit alone. Rather, we should continue to go to them until we bring them to contact the Lord. Then they will get the help. If we desire that someone be gained by the Lord, we have to go to them, possibly for one or two years. Only the proper contact with people to bring them to the Lord can gain them. There is no other way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT CARRYING OUT A SOCIAL WORK,<br>BUT MINISTERING CHRIST AS LIFE</H2><P>We are not sent to carry out a social work. In the church the only effective way to contact people is to minister Christ as life. No one can solve all the problems of society. The Lord Jesus worked on the earth for three and a half years, but He did not change the Jewish society. We should not touch certain matters. We must learn to be wise and not get into the realm of good and evil. If we get involved in a case in the way of carrying out a social work, we will not be able to help people. Rather, we may offend them.</P><P>We have to shepherd all the saints, but if the Lord blesses us, there will be too many persons to take care of. Therefore, we must consider whether a certain case will waste our time. After a certain period of time, we may discover that a certain case is one which no one can help. We must be wise and discern the situation. It may be worthwhile to spend all our time on one family. However, if the Lord has entrusted us with many people, we should stay out of complicated involvements. We have no time to waste. We are not fellowshipping here about a social work. We are fellowshipping concerning how to gain people for the Lord's purpose, and the best and only effective way to gain people is to minister Christ to them. However, not everyone to whom we minister Christ will receive Him. Even when the Lord Jesus preached, not everyone received Him. We have to act in His wisdom and not get involved in difficult situations.</P><P>An elder must not remain in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil. If we remain in this realm for several years, we may get involved with many situations and offend many people. The wisest way to be an elder is to stay away from any kind of involvement in negative situations. If anyone comes to us, we should not care to be a judge or a policeman to arrest them. We should simply try our best to minister Christ to people. If they receive Him, we are thankful to the Lord. If they do not receive Him after several contacts, we may discover that their situation is a hard case which may waste our time.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PURPOSE OF THE ELDERS'<br>CONTACT WITH PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31; Gal. 6:1; Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28; John 4:15</H1><P>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the purpose of the elders' contact with people. The elders must contact people. If the elders do not properly contact people, there is no proper eldership. Many times we consider that the eldership is simply the management of the church, the caring for the things related to the church administration. We feel that as long as the business affairs of the church are adequately cared for, the eldership is proper. However, this is not the case. The church is not a business organization; it is the Body of Christ in life. A church may be organized in a good way, but it still may have a shortage of life. A building complex may be very well arranged and be neat, clean, and beautiful, but there is no life in it. On the other hand, an orchard may seem to be disorderly, but it is full of life, full of fruit. When the Lord comes to look at the church, He looks for life. He looks to see how many persons are under the care of the eldership, how they are doing, and how their growth, life, and daily living are. Therefore, we need a change in our concept regarding the eldership.</P><P>The elders must pick up the burden to contact people. It is not very meaningful for the elders to care for the business affairs of the church. Rather, the elders should make a thorough and clear arrangement in which the business affairs, such as keeping the accounting books, are delegated to the serving ones, the deacons and deaconesses. The elders should not count money; they should count the people under their care. They should know how many people are under their care and what each one's condition is. Of course, the spending of money in the church should be under the direction and management of the elders, but the business affairs should be directly carried out by the deacons while the elders go out to contact people.</P><P>The elders should contact two or three persons a day. Whether or not this is difficult for us depends on our habit. We may not have practiced and exercised to contact people until it has become our habit. Moreover, we may not have been born as persons who like to contact people. However, in the ministry we are compelled, forced, to forget about ourselves and to contact people. The elders need to be adjusted in the matter of contacting people in a successful way. They must answer to the Lord regarding how many persons have been brought to the Lord through them since they became elders and whether their way to contact people is more effective today than it was five years ago. An elder should be concerned about whether or not he has contacted people in an adequate way. It is a failure for an elder not to contact people for several days. All the people in the church need the care of the elders, and the elders can only render care by contacting them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AVOIDING SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, ARGUMENT, OFFENSE, OR ANY FORM OF HUMILIATION</H2><P>In contacting people, the elders must avoid superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation. A superiority complex is very common in human society. Everyone has his prestige and desires to show that he excels in certain things. People like to show their superiority, but the elders should not have a superiority complex. An elder may be fifty-five years old, and the one he contacts may be only fifteen, but the elder should not care for his status. He should be careful in the way he expresses himself when he speaks with this person. The elder should not feel that he is better or higher than the one with whom he speaks.</P><P>In contacting people, the elders should avoid arguments. Arguments do not help people. Rather, the way to contact people is to try to find the opportunity to minister Christ to them, to give them an "injection" of Christ.</P><P>The elders should also avoid offense in their contact with others. Whether one comes to us with a good intention or an intention to cause trouble is not our concern. On our side, we should still be proper. If we are not proper with those whom we contact, we will offend them and cause them to close their heart to us. Once people are offended, there is no way for us to minister anything to them. It is also possible that the offended persons will remember the offense for a long time. The elders must also avoid any form of humiliation in their contact with people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALWAYS REMEMBERING WELL THAT THE CHURCH<br>IS NOT A POLICE STATION OR A LAW COURT, AND<br>THAT WE ARE NOT THE POLICEMEN OR THE JUDGES</H2><P>In their contact with people, the elders must always remember well that the church is not a police station or a law court, and that they are not the policemen or the judges. A policeman arrests people and a judge judges them. We should not "arrest" or judge anyone. We should only minister life, the gospel, salvation, and Christ. Regardless of what one has done, if he comes to us, we should take the opportunity to minister something of life into him. We should not catch him that we might "arrest" him and pass him on to others who may judge him.</P><P>As the leading ones, the elders bear a certain responsibility to consider people's situations, but they must not forget that their ministry is to minister life. When we know someone's background, we should not go to others to talk about him. We should go to him, not to talk about what he has done, but to take the opportunity to minister life and light into him. Then he may be enlightened by the Lord, and when he gets home, he may repent. This is the way for the elders to take care of the people in the church.</P><P>If we know that someone has done something improper, we should not touch it. We must have a strong burden to touch the person, but not his sin or failure. To know others' failures is a strong temptation and a strong spoiling of our contact with them. If we do not know someone's sins and failures, they may be helped by us when we touch them. However, once we know of someone's failures, this knowledge changes our contact with that person. It is difficult to know the defeated background of a brother without being changed in our attitude toward him. We must contact such a brother as if we knew nothing about him and in a way full of life and full of Christ. By one hour of this kind of contact, he will receive something which will enlighten him. Then he may go home to repent to the Lord. This is the way to contact people. We are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14) and the children of light (Eph. 5:8). Whenever we contact people, we should be a light shining over them. People must come to us to be under our enlightening, not our condemning or rebuking.</P><P>When an elder first comes to a church, he may think that the church is very good and that there are many things for him to do in that church and many people to help. Gradually, however, he may come to know the backgrounds of everyone in the church life. Then he may feel that he is jobless because there is no one good enough to help. This is why sometimes it is not good for certain elders to stay too long in a certain church. Some elders eventually become an "information desk," knowing many things about everyone in the church. It is very good if an elder can be in a city for fifteen years and seemingly know nothing about anyone except how to minister Christ to them.</P><P>Knowing too much about people may be illustrated by married life. In the initial years of our marriage, we did not know much about our spouse. Therefore, we loved our spouse blindly. Every lover is a blind person. Love blinds people. However, when our eyes "gain their sight," our love diminishes, and when we know everything about our spouse, our love is spoiled. It would be marvelous if the elders could love everyone in the church life as much as they loved them in the first year they became an elder. When I hear an elder complain about the brothers or sisters, this is an indication that he is finished as an elder. He has lost his ground to help anyone in the church. Only the "blind" elders are the real helpers.</P><P>When we first came to the church life, we did not know anything about the brothers and sisters. As a result, we were pleasant to everyone. Gradually, however, we came to know certain ones, and eventually we could not be pleasant to them. Our eldership has been robbed by our knowledge of the saints. In the beginning of our church life, we had a "honeymoon," but after a few years, certain saints may have even become our adversaries. This is because we know each other too well. This is the hardest part of being an elder. There are many lessons to learn in this regard.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MINISTERING CHRIST TO MEET THE NEED<br>OF ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE</H2><P>In their contact with people, the elders should minister Christ to them to meet their need (Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28). They should minister Christ to everyone&#151;the stronger ones and the weaker ones, the overcoming ones and the defeated ones, those with a good background and those with a bad background. We must be the same toward every person. It is easy for us to minister life to a brother we regard highly, but we may be cold and indifferent to another kind of brother. To behave in this way is to lose the opportunity to minister Christ to this brother. In the matter of ministering Christ to others, we may still have our own choice and preference. We may be willing to contact a brother like Timothy, but we may not take the time to help a brother like Demas, who loved the world and forsook Paul (2 Tim. 4:10). We may welcome Timothy but despise and reject Demas because Demas had a failure.</P><P>Many of us like to help the good ones, but it seems that we feel the undesirable ones are destined to be lost. No one seems to care for them. However, in the churches the so-called undesirable ones may be greater in number than the good ones. First Corinthians 1:26-27 says, "For you see your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn. But God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak of the world that He might shame the strong." If we only care for the good ones, it is no wonder that the church does not have the increase. The Lord Jesus was zealous in contacting the "bad" persons. The publican Zaccheus in Luke 19 was a sinner, but the Lord Jesus was zealous in His contact with him. The elders should learn how to help the ones who are not good. If we learn that certain persons are not good and as a result do not care for them, we lose the opportunity to minister Christ to them.</P><P>We should not expect that our ministering Christ to others will cause them to have a rapid change. When we minister life to a person who has certain failures, our ministering may only help him a little. After a few years such a person may not have had much change. Ministering in the church tests us and requires much patience. We may prefer to see a quick change in people after a few contacts. However, this may not happen. We should care only to minister Christ to people and not care for quick results or for a person's situation or condition.</P><P>In their contact with people, the elders should seek a way to get people to open to them. Then they must find the proper utterance to touch people's spirit. This is a fine work and requires much learning. The elders should also catch the proper time to dispense Christ, either with a quotation from the Bible or with a word of their inspiration.</P><P>The elders must also stir up people's hunger and thirst to seek the Lord by praying with them (John 4:15). Brother Nee once said that to minister a special supply to people is easy, but to cause people to be hungry is hard. We must find a way to create an appetite in people. Certain saints come to the meetings but do not seem to have an appetite for the Lord. We must find a way to create a hunger for the Lord within them. If we would practice to always seek a way to get people to open to us, to find the proper utterance to touch people's spirit, to catch the proper time to dispense Christ either by a verse or by our inspiration, and to know how to create an appetite to cause people to hunger and thirst after the Lord, the attendance in the church will be increased. We must change our way of contacting people, staying away from catching or condemning people, and learning to minister Christ to every kind of person. Eventually, people will be gained by the Lord through our contact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H2><P>Question: How does one overcome in a situation in which he sees people's failures and his contact with people has become spoiled?</P><P>Answer: We must realize that to know others' failures does not help us. We are sent by the Lord only to minister Him to others with His light, life, grace, gospel, and salvation. We are not sent to know others' failures. This realization will help us. We must only care to minister something positive to people and avoid everything else. We should have no heart to know anything else. If the elders are like this, they will love everyone with the same love (Phil. 2:2).</P><P>Only the Lord Himself can know things about others without being negatively influenced by His knowledge. We cannot help but be influenced by knowing too much. Therefore, the best way is to avoid knowing too much. The less we know, the better. If we realize and keep this principle, our visit to any place and our fellowship with others will always be a profit, but if we touch others' mistakes, our fellowship will be profitless. We will lose the nature of the fellowship, and it will become gossip. Only the Lord's grace and mercy can help people, so we must always do our best to minister His love, grace, and mercy to them. This is effective. The church should be filled with love, grace, mercy, and lovingkindness through the ministering of Christ to others. In this way people will be helped.</P><P>When we are helping others to be recovered, we must remember that in nature and essence we are the same as they are. Otherwise, we will be caught by the enemy through our pride. We all are sinful, and sometimes the Lord will allow us to be tested to show us that we are the same as others.</P><P>Question: How can we resume fellowship with a brother who has a problem after we have ceased to contact him for a while?</P><P>Answer: To touch such a brother carelessly is wrong, and not to touch him is also wrong. We must simply take the time under the Lord's sovereignty to minister Christ to him. We do not know what the result of this ministering will be, but we must carry it out. We should not reject anyone but should always minister something of Christ, regardless of who or how he is.</P><P>Question: If someone comes to us and tells us about his own failures, should we stop him or listen to him and try to give him a helping word?</P><P>Answer: We have to discern the different situations. If their speaking is criticism concerning others' failures, it is best to stop it, but we have to exercise our wisdom in doing so. If we tell them to stop speaking about this, we can offend them. We must say something to wisely turn the subject to other matters. However, people sometimes need to come and pour out what is on their hearts. They need to pour out their inward troubles so that they may receive grace. This kind of speaking is healthy. One can sense the repentance in this kind of speaking. After they have opened up their heart to us, we should pray with them. Moreover, we must always stay away from right and wrong. To deal with right and wrong is a temptation which belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><P>Question: When people come to speak about their problems, is it proper to open the Word and show them how the Lord feels about their situation?</P><P>Answer: In principle this is right, but we still need much discernment. Human beings are not simple. We have to exercise our spirit to sense where the person is and what their intention is. We also must learn the lesson to be fearful and trembling, looking to the Lord whenever someone comes to us with a problem. While we are listening, we have to pray, "Lord, show me what I should receive and what I should not receive, and show me how I can help this person." To speak with people is a difficult and dangerous matter.</P><P>Question: What should we do if someone has been born again and is enjoying the Lord, but has not been touched by the Lord concerning an improper situation in which he is remaining?</P><P>Answer: The elders should contact people in a proper way, always avoiding involvement in their situations. They should try their best to simply minister Christ and the gospel with God's salvation, grace, love, mercy, and light in a pure way. Then we will get the benefit. If we do not contact people, there will be a loss; if we contact people carelessly, this will be a killing; and if we get involved in people's situations, there will be a problem. Therefore, we must try to avoid unhealthy involvement, but do our best to minister something on the positive side.</P><P>We must also realize that whatever we do will not be perfect. We should not expect that what we do will be a great success. Rather, we should admit that we do not know what the result of our contact will be. To do our best is all we can do. Perhaps we will even make some mistakes, but the Lord's mercy is with us. If the elders consider in this way, they will always be able to get people saved and bring them into the church life in a remaining way. We are very concerned for the increase in the church, and we have found that the key to the increase in a local church is the elders' contact with people. Without the elders' contact with people, it is difficult for the church to gain people. The saints may bring in people, but the key to the increase in the church is the elders. If the elders do not have a proper contact with people, those whom the saints bring to the church may not stay. The elders are the key to the church life.</P><P>Question: If a person is in an improper situation, how should we regard him in relation to the Lord's table?</P><P>Answer: Only the Lord knows what to do or say in such a case. Isaiah was a holy prophet, but when he saw the vision of the Lord, he said, "Woe is me, for I am finished! For I am a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell" (Isa. 6:5). We may think that we are holy, but when we get into the Lord's presence, our conscience tells us that we are not holy. No one is right. Who is qualified to take the Lord's table? We must learn to minister the positive things to people and see whether there is the real fruit of repentance.</P><P>Question: For the sake of time, is it proper to contact people by telephone, or do we need to visit them or have them into our homes?</P><P>Answer: Today under the Lord's sovereignty we have modern conveniences. The telephone is one of these. We should use the telephone as much as we can for the Lord's interest. It is altogether a profit to call people by telephone. If possible, we may make two or three phone calls a day to the persons for whom we are concerned. The telephone may also be used for morning watch. Our calling people, however, should be done in a warm way from the Lord.</P><P>Question: Should those who are not elders also contact new ones in the way we have fellowshipped here?</P><P>Answer: Contacting people is not a responsibility of only the elders. All the saints should do this. We are in a big "pond" full of "fish." We should speak Christ to people every day.</P><P>Question: In the eldership we cannot help but see things. How can we have discernment without turning it into something negative?</P><P>Answer: The practice of what we have fellowshipped here depends upon our own experience and realization. Whenever we have seen others' failures, we should firstly sympathize with them. Without the Lord's mercy, we would be the same as they are. To consider in this way is helpful. We must realize what we are and experience the Lord's mercy and grace. This will help us to take care of others with sympathy. The person whom we contact may be a weak person, but we also are weak persons. By the Lord's mercy, we may not have given Satan the ground to damage us as this person has, but we must be very watchful and careful lest we fail in the same way.</P><P>We may or may not know a person's failures and sins, but if we minister Christ as life to him, Christ will care for him. He will gradually see the light and repent. We must strongly learn the lesson that it is better not to touch others' failures. We should simply contact people, ministering Christ to them. Then the Lord will do many things. Many confessions are made to the Lord secretly and privately every day by His saints, but all these repentances come from the help of a certain ministry. Without the help of someone's ministering, it is not easy for a person to repent. The church needs the elders' proper contact with people.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ELDERS' EVALUATION OF PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:4; Luke 14:21, 23; 1 Cor. 1:26-29; 12:22-25</H1><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship about the elders' evaluation of people. Most of us have been wrong in this matter. All human beings like to evaluate others. Whenever we see a new person, we like to weigh him, to put him on the scale, the balance. We desire to find out how much he is worth and how weighty or grave he would or could be. We all have such a habit by birth. This habit has gotten into us already. Even young children have the habit of evaluating others in such a way. We need to come back to the Bible to see how the Lord Jesus evaluates people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE SINNERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Desiring All People to Be Saved</H2><P>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all people to be saved. According to God's evaluation, He considers everyone the same in His desire for them to be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord Wanting to Get the Poor<br>and Crippled and Blind and Lame, and Even<br>Commanding Us to Compel Them to Come In</H2><P>I have heard some say that the ones we visit are not worthwhile for us to work on because they are from the lower class. This is wrong. We need to see what the Lord's way is. The Lord wants to get the poor and crippled and blind and lame, and He even commands us to compel them to come in (Luke 14:21, 23). Would we be encouraged by gaining a "crippled" one? According to our natural being, we look down on people. Furthermore, many of us have set ourselves up as a standard. I told one brother that whenever he goes to any place, he has a "yardstick" in his pocket to measure the people and the things there. He does not measure what is good, but he always likes to measure the worst things. It is wrong for the Lord's servants to have such a habit. Whenever we meet others, we should not measure them in this way.</P><P>In the Lord Jesus' earthly ministry, people complained a number of times about the kinds of people He contacted (Luke 15:2; 7:39). When the Lord contacted Zaccheus, He told him, "Today I must stay in your house" (19:5). When others saw this, "they all grumbled, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man" (v. 7). If you met such a person as Zaccheus today, would you go to visit him and stay with him? Our natural being needs to be transformed to a spiritual being so that we can have the view, the sight, that the Triune God has.</P><P>God desires all men to be saved, but actually not one descendant of Adam is worthy of His salvation. We may think that certain people are worthy of the Lord's salvation, but no one is worthy. Daniel 9 records a long confession which Daniel made to God. After Daniel came to know from the book of Jeremiah that the children of Israel would endure seventy years of captivity (v. 2), he made this long confession. His asking for forgiveness was not based upon anything they had done, but upon the Lord's great compassion, His great mercy (v. 18). God's great compassion was the basis for his prayer. Daniel's evaluation of himself and of all his people, including all the rulers and chief men, was that they were in desperate need of God's mercy. We may pray this way at times, but deep within us, we always give ourselves a high evaluation and give others a low evaluation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Choosing the Foolish of the World,<br>the Weak of the World, the Lowborn<br>of the World, and the Despised</H2><P>Among the saints in Corinth, there were not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many highborn; but God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise, and the weak of the world that He might shame the strong, and the lowborn of the world and the despised, things which are not, that He might bring to naught things which are, so that all flesh should not boast before God (1 Cor. 1:26-29). Powerful may refer to the physically, mentally, or positionally powerful. Among the Corinthians, there were not many powerful and there were not many wellborn. Those who are wellborn are those who are born of a noble or royal family. Nearly all of the Corinthians were the lowborn, born of common people. The church of God is composed not mainly of the upper class, but of the lowborn of the world and the despised.</P><P>God has chosen the foolish of the world to shame the wise and the weak of the world to shame the strong so that no one may have any boast, any glory, before Him. God's choosing is not according to whom we prefer. Many parents pray for their children. We need to pray for our children, but we must be careful not to give our children a higher evaluation than others. I still remember a story I read when I was young concerning some parents who prayed and prayed for their children, but none of them was saved. The parents were somewhat unhappy with the Lord. They told the Lord, "Lord, You said that You would give us whatever we ask for when we pray. We have been praying for our children for many years, but still not one of them is saved." The Lord answered them in this way: "If you pray for others' children as you have done for your children, your children will be saved. You need to start praying for others' children."</P><P>Do we believe that our prayer is stronger than God's choosing? Was Jacob chosen by God because Rebecca prayed for him? Is our prayer first, or is God's choosing first? God's selection and predestination are first (Rom. 9:10-13). Abraham had a number of sons (Gen. 25:1-5, 9), but Isaac was the one chosen to fulfill God's promise. We have to learn to be according to God's choice with God's taste. Sometimes the more a brother prays for his wife, the less spiritual she will be. If he would pray for other brothers' wives, the Lord might be merciful to him with his wife. I have also seen a number of sisters who are very spiritual, but their husbands do not love the Lord. This shows us that we should not have our choice in our evaluation of people.</P><P>The person we are praying for and caring for might be another Saul of Tarsus. We may feel that Saul was great, but in Ephesians 3:8 he said that he was less than the least of all saints. To him he was smaller than the smallest among all the saints. The fleshly Corinthians were different than Paul. They said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas" (1 Cor. 1:12). To evaluate others in this way is fleshly. Paul told the Corinthians that God has chosen the foolish of the world that He might shame the wise, the weak of the world that He might shame the strong, and the lowborn of the world and the despised, the things which are not, that He might bring to naught things which are.</P><P>The Corinthians were Greeks, who sought to be strong not only psychologically in philosophy but also physically in athletics. The Greeks were for being strong both mentally and physically, but in the church in Corinth, there were not many strong. God chose the weak of the world that He might shame the strong. God chose the things which are not to bring to naught the things which are. The things which are not refers to those who are nobody. If you are somebody, God will have nothing to do with you. In God's choosing, He shames those who are somebody so that no one can boast before Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>History Teaching Us That<br>Many Useful Servants of the Lord<br>Were Raised Up from the Lower-class People</H2><P>History teaches us that many useful servants of the Lord were raised up from the lower-class people. It is difficult to find a useful servant of the Lord being raised up out of a noble or royal family.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Member of the Body of Christ<br>Being Indispensable</H2><P>Every member of the Body of Christ is indispensable (1 Cor. 12:22). Do we really believe that every member of the Body in our local church is needed? We may say this, but we do not practice it. We actually think that some of the saints are not that important. Whether they are among us or not, we feel about the same. But Paul said that even the weakest ones, the smallest ones, are needed in the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Tempering the Body Together</H2><P>Paul said that the less honorable members of the Body are clothed with more abundant honor, and the uncomely members are given more abundant comeliness; but the comely members have no need (1 Cor. 12:23-24a). According to Paul, God adorns only the less honorable and the uncomely ones.</P><P>God has tempered the Body together (v. 24b). The word tempered means blended; hence, mixed, compounded, adjusted. If a brother is a person with a "high temperature," God will give him a wife with a "low temperature." God tempers a husband and wife. I have heard some brothers say that they cannot serve in a place because they are opposed by certain ones. If this is the case, there is no place for us to serve, because wherever we are, God is tempering us. We need the tempering, the adjusting. If we are fast, God will give us a companion who is slow. If we are smart, God will give us a companion who is not so smart. We may feel that the one who is not smart is useless and that the Body does not need him. But the Body of Christ needs all the members because every member is indispensable.</P><P>Some may be so bold as to consider themselves "heroes" in the church. To think this way is to be like the four beasts in Daniel 7, who were good for trampling others down. The work of such "heroes" who think that they are always right eventually issues not only in division but also in destruction. God has tempered the Body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there should be no division in the Body, but that the members should have the same care for one another (1 Cor. 12:24-25). We should not evaluate anyone, but we need to have the same care for one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Experiences Telling Us That Our Evaluation<br>of the Believers in the Church Has Turned Out<br>Quite Often to Be the Opposite</H2><P>Experiences tell us that our evaluation of the believers in the church has turned out quite often to be the opposite. We may think that a certain brother is marvelous. Eventually, he may not turn out the way that we think he will. We may feel that he is good material to be an elder, but after five years he may no longer be attending the meetings. We may not think much of another brother, but five years later this brother may become very promising and useful in the Lord's hands. Those of us who have been elders for a while have experienced this. Who is the best material to be an elder? Even after many years of serving the Lord, I would say that I do not know. I am saying all of this to show us that we should not trust our own evaluation of people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ELDERS, ON THE ONE HAND,<br>HAVING THE CLEAR SIGHT OVER THE PEOPLE<br>WITH MUCH DISCERNMENT, AND<br>ON THE OTHER HAND,<br>BEING BLIND SPIRITUALLY</H2><P>The elders, on the one hand, should have the clear sight over the people with much discernment, and on the other hand, they should be blind spiritually. Isaiah 11 tells us how Christ carries out God's administration in this way: "He will neither judge by what His eyes see,/Nor decide by what His ears hear./But He will judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land" (vv. 3b-4a). He does not judge by what He sees or hears. With the poor ones, He exercises His righteousness, and with the suffering, afflicted ones, He decides with equity.</P><P>This shows us that regardless of what we see or hear about others, we should not forget what our responsibility is. Our responsibility is to minister Christ to them just as Christ only ministers righteousness to the poor and equity to the afflicted. We should not care much for others' position and condition. Regardless of their condition, we should still minister Christ to them with Christ's salvation. For this we must be persons who are thoroughly dealt with by God. We must be persons who are thoroughly transfused and permeated with God, persons full of the Spirit as Christ was.</P><P>When we contact people, we should not care for what we see about them or hear about them. We must take care of our business to minister Christ with His salvation. Whether someone is a "Zaccheus" or an "immoral woman of Samaria," we should do the same thing. The only difference is the way we would take with each case. The goal of ministering Christ is still the same. Often because of what we see and hear, we become frustrated. We forget to minister Christ with His salvation to people. We pay too much attention to what they are. Suppose a backslidden brother comes to us. If we still remember and are deeply impressed with his backsliding, this remembrance will reduce our usefulness in the hand of the Lord. We should forget about his backsliding. He is still a brother, and our duty, our business, in our eldership is to minister Christ to him.</P><P>We should not exercise ourselves to have a clear sight. That is the self. The clear sight comes from our contact with God. Daniel was a person who received vision after vision. That means he had the clear sight. This was not because he exercised himself in his wisdom, in his knowledge, or in his learning. He received the clear sight because he was a person contacting the Lord. The first six chapters of the book of Daniel show us that the overcomers among the captives, including Daniel, were persons who were always contacting God. Then in the last six chapters, chapters seven to twelve, the visions came to Daniel. Today we must be persons who are filled with the Lord, saturated with Him and full of the Spirit. As such persons, we will not be blind. We will be clear in the spirit. However, we will neither judge according to what we see nor decide according to what we hear. We will do our responsibility according to what Christ is, ministering Christ with His salvation to others.</P><P>Daniel 1 shows us how Daniel and his companions overcame the king, Nebuchadnezzar, in not eating the idolatrous diet. Daniel 3 says that Nebuchadnezzar made a golden image and forced the people to worship it, but Daniel's companions refused to do this and were rescued by the Lord. Although Daniel served the Lord in the midst of such a negative situation under a number of Gentile kings, he was not disappointed. Which one of us would remain in captivity to serve the kings of Babylon and Medo-Persia? Surely they were altogether not promising, yet Daniel remained with them. He just ministered God to them.</P><P>In our service as co-workers and elders, we serve with much selection according to our evaluation. It is best not to have any selection, any choice. We should love everyone with the same level of love. We should care for all the saints, even though some may not like us. Nearly all the elders, full-timers, and co-workers serve people according to their choice, their preference, and their evaluation. When a certain one invites us to their home, we will go because they are our favorite. If another one invites us we will refuse, excusing ourselves because we are too busy or too tired. This means that we are exercising our choice. Our evaluation of others frustrates us. Our natural sight kills us.</P><P>We always need to take care of our duty to minister Christ to others. In a church meeting, someone may stand up and say things that bring death into the meeting. The entire congregation may be disgusted and disappointed with this speaking, but we should not be offended by it. Regardless of this we have to do our duty. After this person speaks, we should rise up to give an edifying, encouraging, life-giving word, without rebuking this person. We should give a strong word, ministering Christ to the entire congregation for perhaps ten minutes. Then everyone will be satisfied by our word, and they will have something on which to feed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING NO ONE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH;<br>EVERYONE IN CHRIST BEING A NEW CREATION</H2><P>We should be blind spiritually because we know no one according to the flesh; everyone who is in Christ is a new creation (2 Cor. 5:16-17). In the flesh everybody is nothing. In Christ we all are the new creation. Therefore, we should learn not to evaluate people. We should just learn to minister Christ to others. We minister Christ to someone to build up the new creation within him. Whether or not he will be promising, whether or not he will be good material for an elder or co-worker, we should leave to the Lord. We should not trust our evaluation of others. We should simply minister Christ to build them up.</P><P>In our contacting of people and in our evaluation of people, we have many "scars." We have many scars because we have done many things wrong in these two matters. If we had never done anything wrong in our contacting of people and in the evaluating of people, we would be very successful in the eldership. We have been greatly frustrated and reduced in our effectiveness in the eldership because our contact with people has not been that proper and our consideration of people has been wrong. Therefore, we have made mistakes, and we have scars. I hope that this fellowship will help us for the future.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRITUAL RESPONSIBILITY<br>OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; John 15:5, 16</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULFILLING THE NEW TESTAMENT<br>PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>In this message we will fellowship concerning the spiritual responsibility of the elders. The elders' spiritual responsibility in a church is firstly to bear fruit, to preach the gospel to gain sinners. In the New Testament, the preaching of the gospel is given a high place. The first thing a local church should do, the first responsibility it should bear, is to disciple the nations, to preach the gospel, to gain sinners. The elders as the leading ones should take the lead to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16).</P><P>In the New Testament, the sequence of the divine economy is very meaningful. Even before the Lord Jesus presented Himself to the public, John the Baptist preached the gospel. According to his birth, John should have been a priest, doing the priestly work, eating the priestly food, wearing the priestly garments, and living a priestly life. However, he did not do this. He left his home and the Old Testament priesthood. He lived in the wilderness, ate wild things, and wore a garment of camel's hair. He did not do anything related to the Old Testament priesthood. Rather, he preached the gospel (Matt. 3:1-2) to gain sinners, offering them as sacrifices to God. His father, as an Old Testament priest, made many offerings as types of Christ, but John did a new thing, offering repenting sinners to be the members of Christ that God in His economy might have the church as the Body of Christ.</P><P>After this, the Lord Jesus came and repeated what John had preached (Matt. 4:17). Then He appointed the apostles and sent them out to preach the gospel (10:1-7). After His resurrection, He charged His disciples, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations" (28:18-19). To disciple the nations is to preach the gospel with authority. It is to disciple, teach, and instruct the nations to be God's people in His kingdom.</P><P>On the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was poured out and the church was established, the first thing the disciples did was to preach the gospel (Acts 2:4, 14). We may think that it is first necessary to build up a church before the members can spread the gospel. However, the history of the church was not in this manner. The Holy Spirit did not wait for the church to be built up. Instead, a persecution was raised up against the whole church in Jerusalem, and most of the disciples were scattered to preach the gospel. Only a few were left in Jerusalem to take care of the church there.</P><P>The apostle John stressed fruit-bearing in his Gospel, telling us that we are the branches of the divine vine, the organism of the Triune God (John 15:5, 16). As His branches, our first responsibility is to bear fruit. In Revelation, John speaks not of the fruit-bearing branches but of the priests of the New Testament in the church, the kingdom age, and in eternity (1:6; 5:10; 20:6). We may think that the fruit-bearing branches in John's Gospel and the serving priests in Revelation are two different things. Actually, they are one. The branches' bearing fruit is the real service of the New Testament priesthood.</P><P>The apostle John told us that we, the New Testament believers, are priests, but he did not tell us what to offer. As a young Christian, I sought to know what we as New Testament priests should offer. I was told that we firstly have to offer our praises and our good conduct to God. I was also told that our giving of material things to others could be considered as an offering to God. However, these are not the main offerings in the New Testament. In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a New Testament priest, offering the sinners saved from the nations as sacrifices to God. He also said that he was poured out as a drink offering (Phil. 2:17), and he charged all the New Testament saints to offer themselves as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). Paul's concept was that he was working on the believers for Christ, ministering Christ to them that he might present them full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28) as sacrifices to God. As the New Testament priests, we should offer to God the sinners saved through our preaching of the gospel. After being saved, they become members of Christ, and since they are the members of the corporate Christ, we offer them as sacrifices to God. The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ; we offer the increase of Christ, the reality of Christ.</P><P>The high point of Peter's Epistles is the portion concerning the priesthood. He presented the New Testament priesthood in a very marvelous way. He said, "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:5). In verse 9 he said, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light." As the New Testament priests, we must be built up into a corporate priesthood to tell out the virtues of God. In this verse Peter did not speak in a common way of preaching the gospel of God's grace, love, kindness, and forgiveness. Rather, he used an extraordinary expression: "tell out the virtues of Him." To "tell out" is to preach, and some of "the virtues" are God's grace, love, kindness, forgiveness, and light. We should have the concept that when we go to preach the gospel, we are going to tell out God's virtues.</P><P>Verse 9 says that God called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. In this verse Peter does not directly mention salvation or the kingdom. Rather, he speaks of God's marvelous light. Light is an indication of God's salvation and of God's kingdom. We have to go out to tell out God's virtues that people may be called out of their darkness into the marvelous light of God. This is to bring them into the kingdom of God. By this we can see that the first responsibility a local church must bear is to tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Taking the Lead<br>among All the Members of a Local Church<br>in Gospel Preaching to Get the New Materials<br>for the Building Up of That Local Church</H2><P>The spiritual responsibility of the elders is to take the lead among all the members of a local church in gospel preaching to get the new materials for the building up of that local church. We must go to get materials. Haggai 1:8 says, "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house." The elders must go to gain sinners as the materials to build up the local church. To gather the new materials is to bear remaining fruit (John 15:5, 16) and to get sinners saved for spiritual sacrifices of the gospel offered to God as members of Christ (1 Pet. 2:5).</P><P>The elders should take the lead to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. However, many elders feel that the first thing they must do is to take care of the affairs of the church. This is the natural, human concept. It is not something of revelation. After one becomes an elder, the first thing he should do is go to tell out the virtues of God, who has called him out of darkness into His marvelous light. Then he can offer the saved sinners to God as sacrifices and as the living members of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Redeeming the Time by Budgeting It<br>to Make a Weekly Schedule for the Gospel</H2><P>For the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the elders must redeem the time by budgeting it to make a weekly schedule for the gospel. To budget our time is to control our time and not to let it go. Some may feel that it is sufficient simply to be spiritual and that budgeting their time is not necessary. However, if we do not budget our time, we are not spiritual in a proper way. Ephesians 5:16 says, "Redeeming the time, because the days are evil." Following this, Paul charges us to be filled in spirit. We must redeem the time in order to be filled in spirit. To redeem the time is to have a real spirituality. Every day it is a struggle to redeem our time. If we do not schedule our time, it flees away. We have no right to say that we have no time to preach the gospel. We must redeem the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Praying for the Salvation of All<br>Our Acquaintances Who Are Not Saved Yet<br>and Following the Lord's Leading to Contact Them Desperately for the Gospel's Sake</H2><P>For the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the elders must pray for the salvation of all of their acquaintances who are not saved yet and follow the Lord's leading to contact them desperately for the gospel's sake. It is a shame if anyone among us still has acquaintances who are not saved. Our acquaintances are only a small group in the realm of our living. Perhaps they number only fifty. At least these fifty must be saved. Although we know that some people will not believe, we should not let this govern our attitude. George Muller prayed for many people, and only two of those he prayed for were still not saved at the time of his death. However, even these were eventually saved. He prayed for many people, and they were all saved. We should consider this matter seriously for our Christian life before the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Seeking New Sources of Sinners<br>as Our Gospel Candidates</H2><P>The elders must also seek new sources of sinners as their gospel candidates. The source of our acquaintances may become exhausted. We should then seek new sources. We may ask a friend to recommend his friends to us. We must find a way to gain more sinners.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Leading Sinners to Know<br>the Main Contents of the Gospel</H2><P>For the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the elders should lead sinners to know God as the source and Creator of the universe, the unique Supreme Being in the entire universe and the only one God for our worship (Acts 14:15b; 1 Cor. 8:6a). They must also lead sinners to know Christ as the only begotten Son of God to be our Savior, who was crucified on the cross for our sins and resurrected from among the dead to be our life for our regeneration (John 3:16; 1 Pet. 2:24a; 1:3).</P><P>The elders must also lead sinners to know man's sin and sins&#151;sin in man's nature and sins in man's behavior (Rom. 7:16-17, 20; 3:10, 12, 23). Likewise, they must lead sinners to know God's salvation by man's believing in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as his Savior and life (Acts 16:31; John 3:16). These points are the main contents of our gospel that we should preach to sinners. However, we have to preach them in different ways according to the different persons we contact.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Crucial Step of Leading a Sinner<br>to Be Regenerated and Saved</H2><P>The crucial step of leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved is firstly to lead him to pray to God and the Lord Jesus by confessing his sins and receiving the Lord Jesus as his Savior and life. When we lead a sinner to be regenerated and saved, we should not talk too much. The more a salesman talks, the more he loses the sale. In the same way, too much talk kills our preaching. At a certain point, we should "close the deal" and lead the sinner to pray. The sooner we bring a sinner to prayer, the better. Of course, we should first say something to open up the sinner's mind, heart, and even his spirit, but then we must help him to pray. If the sinner says that he does not know how to pray, we must teach him and help him to pray.</P><P>We must then lead the sinner to realize that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit desiring to enter into His believers and that he, the sinner, has a spirit for him to receive the Lord Jesus as the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; John 4:24; 2 Tim. 4:22). The Lord is a Spirit, and the sinners have a spirit to receive the Lord as the Spirit. We have to explain this clearly and stress it. This is very crucial.</P><P>The most crucial and key point in leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved is to lead him to exercise his spirit in prayer to contact the Lord Jesus as the Spirit that he may be enlivened. The one we contact may say that he does not know how to exercise his spirit. We can tell him that it is to speak a little louder in prayer and speak from the depths of his being, and we may also demonstrate the exercise of the spirit to him. It makes a great difference whether or not the ones we contact exercise their spirit. It is true that whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, but many have only called on the Lord shallowly and not from their spirit.</P><P>The Lord is the Spirit, and we must worship Him and contact Him in our spirit. This is the principle established in John 4:24, and we must stress this point. We may help them by using the illustration of electricity. We cannot use a piece of wood to contact electricity; we must use metal. Touching electricity with metal is like contacting the Spirit with our spirit. Today Christ is our God, and He is the life-giving Spirit waiting for us to receive Him. We can receive Him only by our spirit. We cannot hear a voice with our eyes or see colors with our ears. We must use the right organ.</P><P>We should spend several minutes to stress this to the one we contact. Then we can ask him to pray. He may have prayed many times without touching the Lord, but we must help him to pray again until we sense that he has touched the Lord and he senses that he has been touched by the Lord. This is very crucial, and this is the key point in leading a sinner to be regenerated and saved.</P><P>Without touching the Lord the Spirit by exercising one's spirit, no one can be properly saved. Electricity may be installed in a building, but we still need the proper connection in order to use it. Too often we try to install the "electricity" in people without leading them to make the proper "connection." We must help people to exercise their spirit, and we ourselves must learn how to be properly connected to the Lord. We must realize that He is the Spirit, that we have a human spirit, and that we should exercise our spirit. Without exercising our spirit we cannot touch the "electricity." We have to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord.</P><P>It is most effective to lead a person to exercise his spirit by leading him to pray and assimilate a Bible verse concerning the gospel. When we pray with someone, we should use some Bible verses. We should present to him some golden verses concerning the gospel. When it is time to pray, it is better to teach the person how to pray-read and digest one of those verses, to assimilate it by exercising his spirit. By this he will contact the Lord, the Spirit.</P><P>It is also crucial to lead a person to have the assurance of salvation (Mark 16:16; 1 John 5:13). According to the Bible, a person is saved based upon the fact that he believes in the Lord Jesus and has called on Him, touched Him, and contacted Him as the Spirit. When we have the sense that someone has touched the Lord, we should help him through some verses to have the assurance of salvation.</P><P>We must also teach the new believer to contact the Lord in the morning, that is, to keep the morning watch for ten minutes every morning (Psa. 119:147-148), and we should charge him to read one chapter of the New Testament every day before going to bed. To use two verses is for morning watch, and to read one chapter is for Bible study. We should help the new ones to have two copies of the Bible. One should be a copy without any notes, to be used for morning watch. The other should be a copy in which the reader makes notes. This was Brother Nee's practice for many years. We should charge them not to read their one chapter at night too quickly. They should try to read it with some understanding. Lastly, it is crucial to teach the believer to pray to the Lord for everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br>THE WORLD SITUATION AND GOD'S MOVE TODAY</H2><P>Now I would like to say something concerning the world situation and God's move. Ephesians 3:20 says that the Lord is "able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us." God fulfills not only what we ask for the church, but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church through the power which operates in us. The recent events in Europe, Russia, and the Middle East have caused us to reconsider the Lord's move on the earth. Likewise, the letters from the saints in Russia have encouraged us. It seems that the whole of Russia is open to the Lord's ministry. Some of the saints there even desire that some of us go to stay with them and help them.</P><P>In the twenty centuries since the Lord's incarnation, the Lord's move on the earth has always gone on according to the world situation. Before the Lord was incarnated, the Romans were expanding. Julius Caesar conquered the Mediterranean areas of North Africa and the Holy Land a little over forty-five years before the birth of Christ. His adopted son, Augustus, defeated his opposition and became the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire in 27 B.C. It was he who gave the decree that a census be taken (Luke 2:1-5). This caused Joseph and Mary to go back to Bethlehem to enroll their names there. By this we can see that the world situation had very much to do with the Lord's birth. It also had much to do with the Lord's death, His resurrection, and the gospel's spread to produce the churches.</P><P>In recent years, the world situation has also influenced the Lord's move. The most significant factor of world history in the last two centuries has been imperialism. Through imperialism, the leading nations invaded the backward countries to exploit the people there. Eventually, however, imperialism opened the gate for the gospel to go to the backward countries. Furthermore, through the Second World War, English became the main international language. Brother Nee spoke very much about the need to spread the Lord's recovery from China, so that the recovery might escape the "imprisonment" of the Chinese language. However, we could not find a way to spread from China. Eventually, however, the Lord's recovery was brought into the English world for the spreading to all the continents.</P><P>The change in the situation in Europe began with the establishment of the European common market. More recently, the satellite countries of Russia have abandoned Communism and have moved toward democratic governments. Even Russia has experienced a certain amount of change, and this has affected eastern Europe very much. East and West Germany have been united. Most recently, there has been a war in the Middle East. All these events have changed the world situation. The world situation today is much different than what it was even a year ago. England and France are now building a tunnel under the English Channel to make traffic between them easier.</P><P>All of these factors have caused us to reconsider the Lord's move in Europe. The Lord's recovery first spread to Europe in 1971. We should not allow Europe to be lost, but neither should we do anything in a quick way according to our natural thought. We have to pray much and consider much. The recovery must spread. There are three factors that run the entire world today: the leadership of the United States, the influence from Europe, and the influence from Asia. The Lord sent His recovery to the United States because this is the leading nation in the world. Because of the English language and the leadership of this nation, the Lord's recovery has spread quickly in the past quarter of a century. However, the world situation has changed, and the Lord's move will probably follow the pattern of this change.</P><P>We must take some practical steps. From now on, we will add French, German, and Russian classes to our full-time training. Moreover, we will encourage saints to give themselves for the Lord's purpose to spread His recovery to the European countries, especially to eastern Germany and Russia. We should go not as individuals; we should go as a team of at least four, including a couple of age thirty or older as the core of the team. This team may go to one of the larger cities in Europe with large universities. We will start the recovery work mainly on the campuses. We hope to rent houses that can be used to take care of weekend guests and can be used as meeting places. If some are ready now to go as such a team, they may go right away. We may first strengthen the ministry in England because eventually England will be crucial for all of Europe.</P><P>What the saints do when they go to Europe depends upon their leading from the Lord. Some may go full-time for the Lord. Others may take a job. Soon there will be more business transactions between the United States and Germany, and more job opportunities will open up. Some may go and enroll in school. However, all should have the purpose of going for the spreading of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>In our full-time training, we will have a class for preparing those who will go to Europe. Then some will go as teams. We will not practice the old things there. We will go to have a new start. All this will be without any official organization. It will be the saints' move according to the Lord's leading. I believe that all the churches will rise up to participate in this matter, especially in the financial support. There is no need to worry about finances. The saints should go by faith. The practical things will be taken care of by the Lord. To support one brother in Russia for the Lord's recovery will not cost very much. If some go to Russia, the churches will easily be able to support them. Some of the co-workers should also be encouraged to go to Europe. We should send not only some "soldiers" but also some co-workers to bear the burden for the Lord's move.</P><P>If we are preparing to go to Europe, we should become acquainted with the way to get sinners saved. If one goes as an English-speaking student, he will be able to associate with the German students there. He will pick up the language very quickly, and within a year he should be able to preach to the students.</P><P>Some need to tell the Lord that they will go to Europe for His recovery. Perhaps soon we will send teams, but we must not treat this lightly. We must receive the Lord's leading with much consideration. We should not say that we cannot go because we are not strong enough. The church in Jerusalem was very young, but the saints there were scattered for the Lord's move. There are many useful brothers in this country who have gained much of the Lord. They need a place to use their capacity and to have it developed. Close to two hundred American saints received training in Taipei, Irving, and Anaheim, but when they returned to their localities, they could not develop their capacity. This does not mean that the churches are opposing the new way. All the churches today welcome the new way, but the situation does not afford much opportunity for the full development of the saints' capacity. Therefore, we must spread by migration. If some remain in the United States, they will not be very useful, but if they go to Europe, they will become useful. Those who are burdened should contact the leading brothers for fellowship.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRITUAL RESPONSIBILITY<br>OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 8:4-5, 26-27; Eph. 2:5; John 3:3, 5-6; Gal. 2:20</H1><P>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the spiritual responsibility of the elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULFILLING THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD<br>OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>The spiritual responsibility of the elders is primarily the preaching of the gospel. The New Testament presents this truth in a very deep, hidden, and significant way. In its highest light concerning the gospel, the New Testament shows that the preaching of the glad tidings is the fulfillment of the New Testament priesthood (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). In Romans 15:16 Paul said, "That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit." The noun priest in Greek means a laboring, struggling, energizing priest. We should be the New Testament priests not merely in position or name but in actuality. We should struggle and be very energetic because we know that Satan's goal is to frustrate the spreading of the gospel. In the entire universe and especially on the earth, there is a struggle between God and Satan. God wants to spread His Son, Christ, as the good news, but Satan hates the spread of Christ. Therefore, we are warring against Satan for the cause of the gospel.</P><P>As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we must offer living sacrifices. In the Old Testament, the priests offered sacrifices from the herd, the flock, and the harvest. All the offerings in the Old Testament were types of Christ. In type, the sacrifice offered to God by the Old Testament priests was Christ. Today the offering of the individual Christ has been accomplished. It is now time for the offering of the corporate Christ. As the New Testament priests, we should offer the members of Christ to God.</P><P>The first priest of the New Testament was John the Baptist. The Old Testament priesthood ended with John. John was born of Zachariah, a leading one in the line of Old Testament priests. John, however, did not stay in the line of the Old Testament priesthood. He did not eat the priest's food or wear the priestly garments. Rather, he lived in the wild, ate wild food, and wore wild clothing. He preached the gospel, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" (Matt. 3:2). John's ministry was to usher in Christ. Eventually, whoever he gained through his preaching was offered to God. After this, the Lord Jesus continued the priesthood of the gospel and raised up more priests. He sent firstly twelve and then seventy to preach the gospel. This preaching of the gospel was to get sinners saved to become the followers of Jesus, and the followers of Jesus were to become the members of Christ that the Body of Christ might be built up to fulfill God's New Testament economy. As New Testament believers, we must fulfill our priesthood to get sinners regenerated to become the members of the Body of Christ. This is the primary responsibility of the elders in the church.</P><P>The primary thing that every co-worker, elder, and serving one in the church must do is to bring forth fruit. A fruit tree does not bear fruit once every five years. According to Revelation 22:2, the tree of life yields its fruit twelve times a year. The tree of life in Revelation 22 is the vine in John 15. The Lord Jesus said that we believers are the branches of this vine, and the branches of this vine are for bearing fruit (John 15:5). If we do not bear fruit, we are wrong. We should bear at least one fruit a year.</P><P>God firstly created one man, but He desired to have many men for His purpose. Therefore, God said, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" (Gen. 1:28). According to this verse, the primary responsibility Adam bore was to reproduce. Likewise, we Christians are charged to bear fruit. All other matters in the Christian life are for this. We read the Bible because we must bear fruit, we pray because we must bear fruit, and we are victorious and overcoming because we must bear fruit. Fruit-bearing is not for the Bible or for prayer. Rather, everything is for fruit-bearing. We have many things today, including Bible reading, Bible study, and prayers, but the one thing we lack is fruit-bearing. An orchard is for fruit-bearing, not for making a show. It is meaningless to keep an orchard clean and in order but not have fruit. It is better to have a messy orchard that is full of fruit. If we do not have fruit-bearing, we cannot have the increase, and if we do not have the increase, we cannot build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Building Up a Habit of the Normal Way<br>for the Spreading of the Gospel</H2><P>In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must build up a habit of the normal way for the spreading of the gospel (Acts 8:4-5). To build up such a habit requires that we have a psychological change in our logic. Concerning the gospel, our logic and our psychology is wrong. Many of us are thoroughly wrong in the preaching of the gospel. We must have a change in our logic carried out in our psychology.</P><P>Often, the natural way of gospel preaching is to invite a good evangelist, a top speaker, who has much knowledge concerning the gospel. We may bring our relatives to a meeting of such an evangelist to answer the altar call. However, many people saved in this way do not remain. We should rather take the biblical way to go to our relatives personally. After a few months one will be saved and will become our co-worker to contact the others. After a few years, many of them will be gained by the Lord. This is the living and effective way to preach the gospel. Most of our relatives who are brought to the Lord by our personal contact over the years will be good preachers to bring others to the Lord. We must have a change from the natural way to the biblical way. If we have a change, the Lord will have a way.</P><P>The proper meaning of visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors is to have personal contact with people. Some churches have endeavored to preach the gospel, but they have had little result. What they have lacked is the personal contact with people. We should keep two or three gospel candidates under our care. If we have close relatives, we should spend our time, heart, and energy on them; we do not need to knock on new doors. In the past we have knocked on many doors, and many were saved and baptized, but the ones who were brought into the church were the result of regular visitation.</P><P>We must visit those under our care at least once a week. A nursing mother must feed her little ones regularly. In the same way, we must visit the new ones again and again. It is true that regeneration is a miracle, but after regeneration, diligence is needed to feed the new ones. If we love the Lord, we must feed His lambs (John 21:15). After the new ones are baptized, we must spend time to take care of them. We must not try to bear fruit too quickly.</P><P>We must have a change in our way for the gospel. We should always have two or three gospel candidates under our care. If we do, one or two remaining fruit will be brought into the church life by us each year. If only one-third of the attendants in the church life pick up the burden to do this, we will have a thirty to sixty percent increase. According to history, however, there has never been a church that had such an increase year after year. This is why Christianity has had a poor increase for the past two thousand years. Since World War II, the Moslems have had a fivefold increase. However, in this same time Christianity has not had even a onefold increase.</P><P>I have watched the Lord's recovery for the past sixty years. What I saw forced me to tell the saints in 1984 that we could not go on in this way. I told them that the first thing we needed was to have the increase. If we would spend two or three hours a week in the gospel, we will have one or two remaining fruit each year. However, even up until today not many have picked up the burden to go out weekly for the gospel in a budgeted way. For this reason we do not see the proper increase in the churches. Today there is no opposition among us to the new way, but neither is there the real burden to go out for the gospel weekly to have personal contact with people.</P><P>According to our logic, to spend two or three hours a week to bear one or two fruit is too slow. It is not too slow, however. A human being is brought forth after nine months of pregnancy, and after being delivered, requires a number of years to be properly established. To contact people and spend our energy to care for them requires a sacrifice. To contact people at our leisure is easy, but to contact them according to a budget and pray for the ones we contact requires that we have a heart to do it and be desperate. Building up a habit of the normal way for the spreading of the gospel also requires us to give up the influence of the traditional practice and to oppose our own preference in the way of gospel preaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning How to Bring People<br>to Have a Personal Contact<br>with the Lord by Their Spirit Directly</H2><P>In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must learn how to bring people to have a personal contact with the Lord by their spirit directly. This is the central, crucial point of our contact with people. We must learn this skill and practice it. In doing anything, we firstly need a practical, particular way. Then we need to exercise the proper skill. We must do things, not in a natural way but in an instructed, trained way. Without the proper way and the skill to carry it out, we cannot do anything effectively. We need to learn the way and the skill.</P><P>In the Gospel of John, there are two illustrations of the Lord's skill in bringing people to contact God. The first is the case of Nicodemus in John 3. Nicodemus took the initiative to come to the Lord, and the Lord said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:5-6). The Lord Jesus pointed Nicodemus to the two spirits. The second case is that of the Samaritan woman. The Samaritan woman did not take the initiative to contact the Lord. Rather, the Lord Jesus approached her, asking her to give Him a drink. That led their talk to the Spirit. Jesus said, "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality" (John 4:24). The Lord Jesus eventually showed the immoral woman the need to exercise her spirit to contact God as the living water.</P><P>The Lord used His skill to bring both Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman to contact God by their spirit, but He applied His skill in different ways. By these two cases we can see that regardless of the way we talk to people, we must have the skill to bring them to contact God as the Spirit by their spirit. One cannot be regenerated without contacting the Spirit directly by his spirit. We may know how to teach or instruct people, but we have not learned the way to enliven them in our contact with them. We must be like electricians who know how to make the proper connections to bring the electricity directly to a person in need.</P><P>It is crucial that we firstly change our way from bringing people to good speakers or meetings to contacting them personally. We should contact new ones and find new sources for gospel candidates. We should always have two or three under our care. It is also crucial that we learn to contact people again and again, waiting for a chance to enliven them, to "connect" them to the "electricity." To have a personal contact with the Lord by one's spirit is to be enlivened by the life-giving Spirit in his or her spirit (Eph. 2:5), to be regenerated in his or her spirit by the Spirit (John 3:3, 5-6), to receive the divine life, that is, the eternal life, into his or her spirit, and to learn to live by this life (John 3:15; Gal. 2:20).</P><P>We should not bring people into Christianity or merely teach them doctrines. We need to have the skill to use the top Bible verses to enliven people and help them to contact the Lord directly, either by a desperate prayer or a desperate confession of their sins. If we have this skill, we will realize how to touch the conscience of those like the Samaritan woman to make them desperate. We will know how to point out that even in their confession of sins, they must exercise their spirit to contact God as the Spirit. We will also know how to give them a verse such as John 3:15 and have a desperate talk with them about believing in the Lord Jesus and being connected to the Spirit. God is Spirit, and the Lord is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). We have to learn how to help people to contact the Spirit by their spirit. We need a change in our way for the gospel. Otherwise, it will be difficult to have a strong church life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FEEDING THE NEW BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2-3</H1><P>The first step of the God-ordained way is the preaching of the gospel according to the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the second step of the God-ordained way. The second step is the feeding of the lambs, the new believers (John 21:15). Some may feel that this is an old subject, but I want to fellowship about this matter in a newer way. My thought concerning the way to meet and to serve has been revolutionized. All of us need to be revolutionized in our thinking with the God-ordained way of meeting and serving for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNIQUE NEED<br>FOR PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY&#151;<br>VISITING PEOPLE REGULARLY</H2><P>For gospel preaching, for feeding the lambs, and for perfecting the saints&#151;the first three steps of the God-ordained way&#151;the very unique need is to visit people. To visit people is to go to them and stay with them. You have to speak with them face to face. If you were to visit someone every week for ten minutes, you could surely gain that person in a year. The biblical way for us to gain people is to visit them, to spend time with them face to face.</P><P>I hope that you will take my advice. Try to select three persons of your choice, and go to them once a week. Do not put them together to have a small meeting. You may visit the first one on Monday, the second one on Wednesday, and the third one on Saturday. Go to them separately. Just go to visit them and see them one by one every week, spending ten minutes with each of them. You do not need to speak too much. Try to do this for half a year. I assure you that they will be gained by you. They will even follow you to practice the God-ordained way.</P><P>In addition to bringing this God-ordained way to all the churches, we are burdened for the release of the truth. This is why we are looking to the Lord to complete our Life-study of the books of the Old Testament. The practice of the church life, however, must match this study of the Word. In my present training of the elders, I do not want to pass on more teachings. I must stress one thing&#151;the elders have to contact people. You should endeavor to contact three people daily or about twenty people a week. When you contact these people, there is no need for you to talk too much. Just go to see them.</P><P>You could even save your time by arranging to have a ten minute morning watch with each of them. The telephone may be used for this purpose. One person can be scheduled at 6:15 a.m., the next person at 6:30, and the next person at 6:45. Within one hour, you could contact three persons in the morning. You could contact the same three persons every morning to pray-read with them, fellowship with them, and enjoy Christ with them in a very brief way. Within three months each person can be contacted at least eighty times. After three months of this kind of consistent contact, these ones can be gained for the Lord's interest.</P><P>Logically speaking, this practice works, but will we do it? Of course, when we endeavor to have morning watch with other brothers, we should ask them what time will be convenient for them, and try to fit into their schedule. We should restrict our time with them in the morning to pray-reading the Word and having a little fellowship about the enjoyment of Christ. This practice will enrich us and the ones for whom we are caring. Furthermore, we will gain them.</P><P>After many years of study, I can tell you that it is not necessary to go out to knock on many doors in our labor for the gospel. We should practice selecting and taking care of three people. We should go to see each of them at least once a week. We do not need to talk too much, and we should not be hurried to baptize them. When we went to Taipei in 1986, we were experimenting to find the most effective way to preach the gospel and gain people for the kingdom of God. We found out that we should not baptize people so quickly. Mainly we need to go to visit them again and again, week by week. When we visit them, we should not speak too much of the truth to them, nor should we try to gain them in a quick way. We just need to go to them continually.</P><P>If we visit a person consistently for three months, that will work out a lot. Then we will gain the real and remaining fruit yearly. To take care of three persons in this way for a year is not too slow. Actually, this is very fast. If one-third of the saints in a locality practiced this, the church there could double within a year. We do not need to worry about what to say when we visit people. The main thing we need to do is visit them and contact them consistently.</P><P>I hope that we would take this charge to visit people consistently. We may feel that this is too difficult. But if we cannot contact three persons every day, at least we can see them once a week. After three months, we will have contacted each person twelve times. We will see a positive result from this kind of labor. I want to say again that we should not try to be that quick, looking for quick results. Instead, we should visit people consistently over a period of time. Perhaps we would not read The Mystery of Human Life with someone until we have visited them three times. The fast way does not work well. The slow way works successfully if we persevere. If we continue to visit three persons three times a week, we will see something happen positively. If we want to see our church increased, we must practice this.</P><P>For the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the new believers, and the perfecting of the saints, we must visit people. A proper elder, a top elder, must be a person who practices visiting people regularly. We may feel that we do not know how to perfect people, but we all can go to them. We should focus our attention on going to see people and letting them see us. This practice will bring in the increase. Because I love the churches, I am concerned for their increase.</P><P>A number of the new churches in the Lord's recovery are growing fast, but many of the older churches, which have been existing for twenty years or so, have had very little increase. A church established in 1970 with fifteen saints may still be under fifty today. We have been very busy meeting, taking care of the church, and managing the church, but it seems that there has been little result to our labor. The reason for this is that we have been short of visiting people.</P><P>In Christianity there is a rule. If someone is a good, fundamental pastor and speaks to his congregation every Lord's Day, he will spontaneously gain a ten percent increase through the relatives and children of the people. He does not need to give good sermons. He just needs to open up the Bible every week to say a short word to the people and learn how to go to the door afterwards to shake hands with everyone in a way that can touch their hearts. Then during the week he needs to visit them. This is the way they can gain a ten percent yearly increase in Christianity. Their secret to get and to keep people is to visit them. I am sharing this to show us that we are short of visiting. We speak too much, preach too much, and teach too much with very little visiting. Most people are gained by face to face contact, and most are retained and built by such personal contact.</P><P>The Lord's recovery began in the United States about thirty years ago. At that time there were some real seeking ones among the Christians who were ready to receive something. The recovery met their need. Many were gained through the ministry of the word. Today, however, we are short of a new crop. It seems difficult for us to gain new ones because we do not have the practice of visiting people. We all have to see this secret. If we do not pick up the practice of visiting people and talking to them face to face, the mere teaching of the new way, the biblical way, the God-ordained way, will not work. Only one thing works&#151;visiting people and seeing them face to face.</P><P>Christianity has built up an atmosphere of only the pastors being able to do something for God. This atmosphere annuls the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ and builds up the clergy-laity system. All of us need to rise up to visit people, contacting them with Christ. As long as we pick up this practice, we have the secret. Just like in fighting with new weapons, we can win the battle for the increase of the church with the "new weapon" of visiting people.</P><P>When some of us visit people, we talk too much. We try to gain them by gaining their mind. This is wrong. We gain people by gaining an intimacy with them, by showing an intimate concern for them. If we merely teach them to help their understanding, they will not follow us. But if we visit them and become intimate with them in a proper way, we will gain them for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEADING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO KNOW<br>THAT THE LORD, OUR SAVIOR, IS A LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br>AND THAT WE HAVE A SPIRIT, REGENERATED</H2><P>Many Christians today do not know that the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a regenerated spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:16). Thus, the first meal we have to feed the new believers with is that our Savior today is a life-giving Spirit and that we have a spirit. Even about thirty years ago when I came to the United States, people told me that they had never heard that they had a human spirit. We need to help the new believers by showing them this truth in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HELPING THE NEW BELIEVERS TO REALIZE<br>THAT THE LORD AS THE SPIRIT LIVES<br>IN THEIR SPIRIT AND THAT THEY SHOULD<br>ALWAYS EXERCISE THEIR SPIRIT BY PRAYER<br>TO CONTACT THE LORD, THE SPIRIT</H2><P>We also need to help the new believers realize that the Lord as the Spirit lives in their spirit (Rom. 8:11, 16). This should be ministered to the new believers immediately after they are baptized. They also need to realize that they should always exercise their spirit by prayer to contact the Lord, the Spirit (Eph. 6:18a). Even those of us who have been Christians for many years neglect the exercise of our spirit. We are weak and low in our spiritual life because we do not continually exercise our spirit by prayer to contact the Lord. When we pray we may subconsciously have the thought that the Lord is merely sitting on the throne in the heavens. Although this is true, we should also have the consciousness that we are praying to the One who is in us and who is one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). This kind of consciousness will change our prayer life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TEACHING THE NEW BELIEVERS<br>TO READ TWO VERSES OF THE BIBLE<br>EVERY MORNING FOR MORNING WATCH<br>AND ONE CHAPTER BEFORE GOING TO BED</H2><P>We need to help the new believers get into the new way of morning watch. They should not read too many verses of the Bible in the morning. Instead, they should learn to chew and digest two verses. They should also be encouraged to read one chapter of the Bible before going to bed. We should not be so legal about when they read. They may read the Bible when they return home from work. Instead of reading the newspaper, they can read a chapter of the Bible. After developing this habit, they may go on to study the Bible. Before going on to study, however, they should read one chapter every day. If they have any additional time, they can study it. Thus, the new ones should be brought into enjoying two verses in the morning for morning watch and one chapter in the evening for being taught by God (1 Pet. 2:2-3).</P><P>We need to read the Bible and eventually study it so that we can be taught by it. From my study of the Bible, I have been taught world history from God's perspective. Daniel 2 records Daniel's interpretation of a great human image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream. That image signifies the entire human government. Human government started in Genesis 10 with Nimrod who built up Babel. He was the beginning of Babylon. This government will continue to the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, Antichrist (see notes on Rev. 17:10-12 in the Recovery Version). The entire human government in the eyes of God is composed of four empires as signified by the four parts of the great human image in Daniel 2. The head of gold signifies the Babylonian Empire (vv. 36-38). The Medo-Persian Empire is signified by the breast and arms of silver (v. 39a). The Macedonian-Grecian Empire is signified by the abdomen and thighs of bronze (v. 39b). The last empire, the Roman Empire, is signified by the legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay (vv. 40-43). In the human image there are only four great empires. This is the entire human government. Based upon this divine view, we are living in the stage of the Roman Empire today. Today the law of the world is based upon Roman law. Furthermore, the entire world is full of Roman politics and Roman culture. Roman culture may be considered as a consummated culture, which is composed of Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman law and politics. In God's eyes we are still in the continuation of the Roman Empire today.</P><P>This shows that if we get into the Word, we will be taught of God. We need to use our time to read the Bible. Paul told Timothy that the Bible is profitable for teaching (2 Tim. 3:16). We should be taught by the Bible, and help the new believers to be taught in this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEADING THEM<br>TO KEEP MORNING WATCH<br>(THROUGH THE TELEPHONE AS THE BEST WAY)<br>WITH THE TWO VERSES WHICH THEY<br>SHOULD READ IN THE MORNING</H2><P>We need to learn to use the telephone to help the new ones keep morning watch. Today the telephone is a "modern weapon" we can use. Anyone who is not having a morning revival with the Lord is defeated. All the elders should keep morning watch and should also practice having morning watch with others on the phone. I would encourage the elders to try to do this with others six days a week. We should not do this with the same person throughout the week. Instead, we may have morning watch with six different people on the six days of the week. This will really help people. When we help people in this way, we are the ones who receive the top benefit. There is the urgent need everywhere to help and to stir up the saints to participate in this new way of morning watch.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VISITING THEM ONE OR TWO TIMES EVERY WEEK<br>TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR SPIRITUAL CONDITION AND NOURISHING THEM AS A NURSING MOTHER</H2><P>We also need to visit the new believers one or two times every week to take care of their spiritual condition. We need to go to see them. If they are sick or troubled, going to see them will warm up their heart.</P><P>We should nourish them as a nursing mother caring for her own children (1 Thes. 2:7). We should not give them too much teaching. Instead we need to nourish them by giving them small portions of spiritual food. This nourishment will cause them to grow. Peter says that the guileless milk of the word will cause the new ones to "grow unto salvation" (1 Pet. 2:2). While they are growing, they are being saved. To grow is to be saved. The way to raise up the new believers is to nourish them that they may have the growth in life which issues in the daily salvation.</P><P>In conclusion, I want to stress again that what is needed among us is the practice of visiting people. The full-timers among us should spend ninety percent of their time for visiting, going to see people again and again. We need to visit people regularly according to a schedule. Then the church will be taken care of, and we will gain the increase. By visiting we will gain people; by visiting we will keep people; and by visiting we will help them to grow.</P><P>Eventually, the new believers will attain to the experience of prophesying in the church meetings according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. When the whole church comes together, all can prophesy for the building up of the Body of Christ. The basic factor to bring people into the God-ordained way is to visit them. Visiting will spontaneously carry out the first three steps of the God-ordained way&#151;gaining sinners, feeding the new believers, and perfecting the saints. Then the ones whom we perfect will be brought into the fourth step of prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>AND BEING RESCUED FROM<br>THE PAPAL AND CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEMS</H1><P>Over the course of the past seven and a half years, I have nearly exhausted sharing concerning the truth of the God-ordained way. In this training, I do not want to repeat what I have already shared in the past. The verses in the Scripture concerning the God-ordained way have been repeatedly quoted to us again and again. I still have a heavy burden to have some practical fellowship concerning our experience and practice of the God-ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S RECOVERY BRINGING US OUT OF<br>THE PAPAL AND CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEMS</H2><P>The God-ordained way as revealed in the Bible is the proper practice of the church life against the papal and clergy-laity systems. The papal system is the system of the pope in the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church is called "The Mother of the Prostitutes" (Rev. 17:5). Out of this impure, dirty mother, another system was produced&#151;the clergy-laity system. The clergy-laity system, as the daughter of the papal system, is the system of Protestantism. The Bible reveals the God-ordained practice to encounter these two systems. The Bible has its own practice and principle. The biblical practice and principle are always being put down by the papal and clergy-laity systems. The goal of the papal and clergy-laity systems is to annul the Body of Christ and replace it with a religion. The intention of God's economy is to have an organic Body built up for Christ. But after nearly two thousand years of church history, what is prevailing today on this earth is an organized religion, comprising Catholicism and Protestantism.</P><P>When we left the divisions, we left the papal system with the clergy-laity system, but not many among us know what we have done or what we are doing here today in the Lord's recovery. The Lord's recovery has been lowered down by this ignorance. There are those among us who think that there is not much difference between us and the denominational churches. This kind of thought among the brothers and sisters may be because our testimony has been somewhat weak. Our testimony may not have been strong enough to bear the particular significance of the Lord's recovery to the ones who have been with us for a number of years, including all the ones who have made or caused division in the past seventy years of our history. During the time of my ministry outside of mainland China in the past forty years, there have been at least three divisions caused among us. Every division showed that those who participated in them did not have a clear view about the recovery.</P><P>What is the recovery according to the Lord's mind? It is to get His believers out of the papal system and the clergy-laity system. We should not forget that the intention of these two systems is to build up a religion, including Catholicism and Protestantism, to replace and put down the Body of Christ. Those who have made divisions in the Lord's recovery did not clearly see this. Even I am concerned that we ourselves might not be so thoroughly clear about this. We left the denominations, the divisions, but we did not fully give up the papal and clergy-laity systems. We have outwardly come out of the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations, but we still carry and walk in these two systems.</P><P>The real significance of the pope is in the papal system, and the real control of the saints is in the clergy-laity system. What the Lord wants in the new way is for us to leave the papal system and the clergy-laity system. To remain in these systems is to be a Nicolaitan. The Nicolaitans are mentioned in Revelation 2:6 and 15. According to the meaning in Greek, this group of people are those who climb above the laity. They are a group of people who esteem themselves, the clergy, higher than the common believers. According to Revelation 2:6 and 15, the Lord hates the works of the Nicolaitans with their teaching. The works and teaching of the Nicolaitans are prevailing in both Catholicism and Protestantism.</P><P>The system of one man speaking and the rest listening is a part of the papal and clergy-laity systems. As long as we remain in this realm, we are Nicolaitans. The Nicolaitans are those who put down the Body of Christ and annul the members of the Body of Christ. Catholicism and Protestantism build up a religion to replace and put down the Body of Christ. Spontaneously, they kill and annul all the members of the Body of Christ by depending on a class of people called the clergy. Unconsciously, much of what we do may be in the same principle.</P><P>The church is the Body of Christ and the new man. It is not normal for only a small number of the members of a person's body to function while all the rest are paralyzed. A normal man uses all of his physical members. We need to consider today's situation in Christianity, in Catholicism and Protestantism. Where is such a corporate man, comprising the living, active, functioning members of the Body of Christ to fulfill the purpose of God? There is not such a thing. Mostly what is considered in Christianity is the work of gaining sinners, winning souls, to build up a congregation. That is not for the Body of Christ. Our concept has been captured by that practice. We left Babylon, but Babylon's principle and philosophy still remain with us. We left Babylon, but the Babylonian system would not leave us.</P><P>What is the new way, the God-ordained way? The God-ordained way is to rescue us from this Babylonian capture. We have been captured by the philosophy of the papal and clergy-laity systems. We are still carrying, probably unintentionally and subconsciously, the philosophy of these systems with us in whatever we do. This is why I say that we have to endeavor to change our philosophy. We are not building up any kind of religion. We are building up the Body of Christ, and we are building up the new man. We should be perfecting all the members of the Body and equipping all the parts of the new man, but we do not do much perfecting or equipping. In actuality we left Babylon, but the Babylonian philosophy still goes with us. Unconsciously, we still like to keep this philosophy. There is the need of a revolutionary change from this old philosophy to the new, scriptural principle.</P><P>In our elders' training thus far, we have seen that we need to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. We need to preach the gospel according to the way of the New Testament. We have also seen the need for the feeding of the new believers in the home meetings. We need to feed the new ones, nourishing them so that they may grow. Then we have to have group meetings to equip, to teach, and to perfect the members of the Body of Christ so that they all will be able to do the same work that the gifted persons do to build up the Body of Christ. Finally, we need to attain to the stage of every member of the church prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ and as the new man.</P><P>Our lack is in the actual practice of the God-ordained way. According to the actual practice, the God-ordained way replaces the papal system and the clergy-laity system. To replace these systems is to kill the practice of today's Christianity. We should not preach the gospel in the old way of winning souls. Instead, we should practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel to present and offer saved sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5). To carry out the papal and clergy-laity systems, one must have a gathering in which one or two speak to convince and help others to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved. But the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel does not depend mainly upon gatherings with good speakers. This practice altogether depends upon the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ to contact people individually, one by one.</P><P>We should not despise the individual contact with people. As long as we do not practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by contacting people one by one, we are still somewhat remaining in the papal and clergy-laity systems. In Christianity a small number of the ones who are brought to Christ go to seminaries to learn how to be the clergy. They do not have the thought that they have been saved and regenerated and are being sanctified and transformed as the living members of the Body of Christ. It is easier to practice the old, organizational clergy-laity system than it is to gain people one by one and present them as sacrifices to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENDEAVORING TO CHANGE<br>TO THE NEW WAY, THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>We need to change our way. To change to a way to which we are not accustomed is difficult. It is difficult for many Chinese to use a fork instead of chopsticks. No one likes to change to a new way. A Chinese person who has moved to the United States may use chopsticks ninety percent of the time and a fork only ten percent of the time. This illustrates our situation today in changing from the old way to the God-ordained way.</P><P>For the preaching of the gospel, we need the individual, direct contact with people, one on one. We also need this kind of personal contact for the feeding of the new believers. We have to feed the new believers one by one. This requires much endeavor and labor. Instead of doing this, though, many of us are occupied with other things which we think are necessary for the managing of the church. These things may be right, but actually they are not so necessary. The necessary thing for the elders is to visit people and contact them one by one.</P><P>We have to endeavor to pick up our "fork" and throw away our "chopsticks." To pick up the fork is to pick up the practice of contacting people one by one. This is why I have said that the elders should endeavor to contact twenty people a week. Contacting people one by one saves us from building up a religion. This personal contact with people builds up the Body of Christ. This is a very serious matter. The only thing that bothers me, burdens me, and troubles me is that the elders and co-workers are not so absolute, adequate, and quick in changing to the new way. Our practice of the new way thus far has just about maintained our present number in the churches. Actually, there has not been enough advance, increase, or growth.</P><P>We have to change our way, especially for the practice of the group meetings. Thus far, it is difficult to see a group meeting fully practicing in an organic way according to what we have seen and ministered as revealed in the Word. A group which is meeting together may not constitute a proper group meeting. A proper group meeting should have the mutuality in every way. The teaching should be mutual, the asking and answering of questions should be mutual, the fellowship should be mutual, the intercession should be mutual, and the shepherding and care of the saints should be mutual. When we carry out all these mutual things, that is a proper group meeting. This kind of group meeting perfects the saints. Many of our group meetings are natural. They are not group meetings which are practiced according to the New Testament teaching, especially in Hebrews 10:24-25. There is the need of much learning to practice the charge in Hebrews 10:24-25.</P><P>The co-workers and elders should learn how to contact individual saints to fellowship with them particularly concerning the group meetings. We need to fellowship with them concerning how to have the mutual teaching, the mutual asking and answering of questions, the mutual fellowship, the mutual interceding, the mutual care, and the mutual shepherding. All of this is the mutual equipping and perfecting. If there is an elder in a group meeting, the entire group may look to him for help, thinking that they do not have much knowledge or experience. This is absolutely wrong. This is the philosophy of the papal system and of the clergy-laity system. This philosophy should be put aside.</P><P>The elders should spend time and energy to teach each one of the attendants of the group meetings. They need to go to each of the saints' homes outside the group meeting. This is why Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house and that he admonished each one of them night and day with tears (vv. 20, 31). Paul used both the day and the night. We mostly use our meeting time to contact the saints. We think that as long as we have attended every meeting, we have fulfilled our duty. But that is not the complete fulfilling of our duty. The fulfilling of our duty is also outside the meetings.</P><P>Our priestly duty and labor are mainly in the visiting and contacting of people. When I found out that some of the full-timers were being used by the church to take care of arranging the chairs, I was grieved. This is not the reason we have full-timers. The full-timers are not for the arranging of chairs. If we do not have the people to arrange chairs, we should hire someone. The saints should be absolutely freed to contact people. The full-timers need to spend all of their time getting themselves educated in the holy Word and contacting people. I encourage the full-timers to spend two hours every day with the Lord in His Word. Then they should use the rest of the time for contacting people one by one.</P><P>There is no way to carry out the God-ordained way except by the individual contact with people. What is needed today is for the full-timers, co-workers, and elders to spend their time, energy, and spiritual capacity to take care of people individually. The main thing we are learning to do in the elders' training is to contact people for their salvation, their feeding, their spiritual education, their equipping, and their perfecting. Within a period of one or two years, they should be able to do the same thing that we are doing in our service to the Lord. Today the result of our work is not like this. I hope that we would consider this fellowship seriously and have a full change in our concept and practice.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br>TO PROPHESY IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br>FOR THE BUILDING UP<br>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1, 31; Eph. 4:12</H1><P>Our responsibility is to fulfill our duty in the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. As priests of the gospel, we must get sinners saved that they may be offered to God as sacrifices (Rom. 15:16). We must also feed the new believers in home meetings and perfect the saints in the group meetings, that the saints may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry (Eph. 4:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROUP MEETINGS IN MUTUALITY</H2><P>The group meeting revealed in Hebrews 10:24-25, strictly speaking, is not a meeting for gospel preaching, feeding the new believers, or for prophesying. The group meeting is a meeting for mutuality. The reason I do not use the word small in regard to the group meeting is because a small meeting is a home meeting. The group meeting, however, may not be very small. Its size may be from twenty to forty members.</P><P>Some among us have not yet entered into the proper realization and practice of the group meeting. According to the New Testament, the group meeting comprises mutuality in shepherding, caring, interceding, teaching through asking and answering questions, perfecting, and equipping. The group meeting is eighty percent of the practical church life. The church life is inadequate without the group meetings. We are weak and very short in our practice of the church life today because we do not have the proper group meetings in mutuality.</P><P>The meetings of the church should be in mutuality. Mutuality is different from plurality. The responsibility of the eldership in the church should be borne in plurality. The responsibility of the eldership in the church life should be taken care of by at least three persons. In a local church, there should not be less than three elders. Actually, the more elders the better. The eldership is a matter of plurality.</P><P>Mutuality is for the church meetings. Formerly in our practice, we only had one or two speakers in the meetings. Today some may think that, if we arrange to have eight to ten speakers in the meetings, we have mutuality. Actually, this is plurality, not mutuality. The ten speakers would become clergymen, and the rest of the saints would become laymen. In the church meetings, however, everyone can speak to build up the church. This is mutuality.</P><P>According to the clergy-laity system, if a question is raised in a group meeting, only the leader of the meeting is qualified to answer the question. But in the group meeting, everything is mutual. If I ask a question, someone who was baptized three days ago can answer my question. He may not be able to answer my question adequately, but whether an answer is adequate or not is a matter of degree. When I ask a question in a group meeting, the answer someone gives may be absolutely wrong. The answer may be wrong, but the activity of each one answering is right. To sit quietly in the meeting without speaking is absolutely wrong. It is better to function in a wrong way than not to function at all.</P><P>To speak in the group meeting is right, but to be silent is wrong. In a meeting in Elden Hall in 1966, I stood up and said that everyone could speak at least four words in a meeting. As I said this, I wondered what four words everyone could speak. Then I said that everyone could say, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" The Scriptures are full of the expression "O Lord," and Revelation 19:4 says that the elders and living creatures worshipped God, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!" We can speak and sing these four words in any kind of meeting. In this way our meetings will never be silent. To sit silently does not require the exercise of our spirit, but to speak does. Our speaking in the spirit is very pleasant to the Lord. Today if our meetings are full of speaking, more people will come to the meetings. But our silence will kill the meetings, and fewer people will come.</P><P>Every kind of Christian meeting, including the group meeting, is for worship. To bow down or kneel down is not the true meaning of worship. To worship God is to enjoy God. According to John 4, to drink Him as the living water is real worship (vv. 14, 24). To drink the living water is to enjoy God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO PROPHESY</H2><P>First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy." The wording of this verse is very emphatic, stressing the matter of prophesying. This is indicated by the phrase "but rather that you may prophesy." Here the word rather means especially. Paul encouraged the saints to pursue love and to earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but he especially encouraged them to prophesy. The stress here is altogether on the matter of prophesying.</P><P>First Corinthians 14:31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged." The words learn and be encouraged are placed together in this verse to show that learning leads to encouragement. In order to prophesy we must first learn ourselves. "That all may learn" refers to the hearers. Since the hearers should learn what the speaker says, the speaker also must learn a great deal. Prophesying requires much learning. When we have learned something, we are able to prophesy. Then through our prophesying, others will learn from us.</P><P>To prophesy according to 1 Corinthians 14:31 is not something which comes down upon a person suddenly in a meeting. That kind of experience does not require any learning. Prophesying requires learning. In order to help the saints to learn how to prophesy, we published the books entitled The Holy Word for Morning Revival. In these books only a few verses are given for each day, and we encourage the saints to digest these verses through reading and pray-reading them again and again. We have provided some space within these books for writing down the inspiration one receives each morning. After six mornings, one may have six inspirations. Then these six inspirations can be used to compose a prophecy to speak in the church meeting on the Lord's Day. This is a very good way to learn to prophesy.</P><P>Today in the churches, we are still learning how to prophesy. One thing which I practice to enrich my prophesying is to read diligently. My riches come from my diligent reading. Throughout the past sixty-six years, I have been diligently reading the Bible and the best writings concerning the Bible. The notes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study messages can help us to enter into the divine revelation in the holy Word. Learning to prophesy requires our labor on the Word with the help of the proper exposition that opens up the Word.</P><P>The elders have to spend a great deal of time to stir up the brothers and sisters to have a heart to learn to prophesy. The elders must also learn to prophesy. If you have never learned, how can you teach others? In one locality, some of the Chinese-speaking sisters have been burdened to teach some of the other sisters to prophesy. They encourage the sisters to compose their daily inspirations into a prophecy. The sisters then present their compositions for correction to the other sisters teaching them. Sometimes their compositions are too long, or the point of their prophecy is not very clear. One sister who is more than eighty-eight years of age has asked another sister who is a little over thirty years of age to correct her prophecy. Once her prophecy has been corrected, she comes to the meeting and anxiously waits for an opportunity to speak. She likes to be the first one to speak. Whether or not her prophesying is so good or so rich, I do not care. What I care for the most is her spirit. If all the brothers and sisters in the different localities would have such a spirit, the meetings would be very high.</P><P>Today, however, most of the saints do not have a strong sense of the need to prophesy in the church meetings. They may come to the Lord's Day meeting for the Lord's table and the prophesying meeting, but they are very relaxed with little exercise of the spirit. Do you not believe that such a situation is an offense to the Lord? If anyone comes to meet with the Lord in the meeting without exercising his or her spirit, this is wrong. The elders' responsibility is to stir up the saints by telling them that it is altogether an offense to the Lord to come to the meeting in a loose way without exercising their spirit.</P><P>I have rarely seen a place where the elders promoted, adjusted, and improved the spirit, attitude, and preparation of the saints in coming to the meeting. In order to do this, the elders themselves must take the lead to be prepared. Their spirit must be high and ready. Then they will have the standing and the qualification to edify others. The elders should come to the meetings early. The way they sit in the meeting, their gesture and attitude, should be right. Because we are meeting with the Lord, we should not be so loose.</P><P>The elders must also bear the responsibility for the attendance in the prayer meeting. In some places, the attendance on the Lord's Day is one hundred, but the attendance of the prayer meeting is less than thirty. This percentage is typical throughout the churches. The elders must say something. The elders must struggle and strive. No crop will grow without plowing, sowing, and watering. The farmer's duty is to labor diligently. The elders must labor diligently in the same way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FULL-TIMERS NOT REPLACING THE SAINTS</H2><P>Recently, several leading brothers related to me how their oneness had been recovered and how they are now on fire. They asked me to assign a small number of full-timers to their area. In my fellowship with them, I told them that they should not expect the full-timers to do the work for them. The full-timers should not do anything to replace others or to replace others' work. The work of the full-timers, if they are really capable, is to show others a pattern and to develop others so that the others can do more. The full-timers have been trained to work directly and not to do anything to replace others' work. But I am concerned that the full-timers are doing a replacing work. The reason for my concern is that the brothers have often told me, "Brother Lee, thank the Lord for the full-timers who have come to help us." When they use this word help, I realize that the full-timers might actually be replacing others. The full-timers must condemn themselves if they do anything in a place to replace the saints. This is to repeat the clergy-laity system, which is condemned by the Lord.</P><P>The full-timers are neither clergy nor laymen. They are simply ordinary members of the Body of Christ. Those who are not full-timers should do the same thing as the full- timers. The only difference between the full-timers and the other saints is the amount of time that each one puts in. Saints who are not full-time have a job and may have a family, so they do not have a great deal of time to invest in the Lord's work directly. The full-timers have dropped their jobs in order to put all of their time into the Lord's recovery. In principle, the saints and the full-timers are the same. The difference between them is only in the amount of time each one gives to the Lord's work. This does not mean that the full- timers put in the time to work for the Lord and that the others do not need to work. This is the system of clergy and laity in Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERING THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE SAINTS<br>IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H2><P>The way of Christianity is to use big speakers with a good meeting place to attract people. This is their facade. People can go there, attend a service, and relax after working all week. But in the churches, we do not have this kind of attraction. Our attraction is that everyone functions. When other Christians come to visit our meeting, they may be shocked to see so many functioning.</P><P>The elders must bear the responsibility to stir up each member in their church to function. In order to do this, the elders must have personal contact with the saints. This requires their time and energy, and this is a real sacrifice. In a previous message, I said that a good elder should contact twenty people a week. This may sound like a large number, but actually it is not. You can contact people by telephone at least three times a day. You can call one in the morning, another one at noon, and still another one at night. If you did this seven days a week, twenty-one people could be contacted.</P><P>In your contact, you should not just inquire about the saints' welfare. Take the opportunity to fellowship with the saints about the Lord's interest on earth, and take the time to have a little prayer with them. If you contacted twenty saints in this way, after one month you would see a fresh situation in your locality. To contact the saints makes a big difference. To be an elder today, the major thing is to contact people, but you must contact people in the new way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHANGING TO THE NEW WAY</H2><P>We must change our philosophy and logic and drop everything of the old way. We must be willing to change to the new way. Man cannot change the globe, but he has improved the means for traveling around the globe. Man discovered the wheel as a means of travel thousands of years ago. Today every means of travel depends upon the wheel, even the airplane. But there have been many changes and improvements throughout the years since the discovery of the wheel. In the same way, we must have a change. I have been speaking concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, for the past seven and a half years, but I have not seen much real practice of the new way. Today everyone welcomes the new way. Thank the Lord for this. But I still beg you all to have a change.</P><P>The God-ordained way to meet and to serve is the present tide of God's move. When a tide comes in human culture, no one can stand against it. The tide and the trend in human culture will sift everyone who does not go along with it. Today in human culture, democracy is a tide. Communism has been practiced for about seventy years, and people have found out that it does not work. It has caused people to suffer. Now people who have been under the practice of communism are tired of it. They do not want communism or atheism. They want democracy and western culture with the Bible. This is why we have the burden to go to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. We should go, not with the element of old Christianity, but with the new way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED OF BEING IN ONE ACCORD<br>IN THE ELDERSHIP</H2><P>I want to share something more concerning our service as elders. In order to take care of the church, the elders must be in one accord. Once you lose the one accord, the blessing is gone. In the New Testament, the blessing of the outpoured Spirit, which is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17), was brought in by the one hundred twenty being in one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:1-4). In the book of Acts, the one accord is mentioned five times (1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25). If we are not in one accord, we are through with the oneness of the Body, and the blessing in the church and in the work will be gone. This should be a serious warning to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE THINGS TO AVOID IN THE ELDERSHIP</H2><P>In order to keep a good, excellent, and beautiful order in the church, the elders should remember to avoid three things. First, each of the elders should not regard himself as higher, more experienced, or better than the other elders. This is fully taught by Paul in Philippians 2. To consider that you are superior or that you are the senior one will damage you and hurt others.</P><P>Second, the elders should not exercise any kind of control. The elders should keep Peter's word in 1 Peter 5:5 and Paul's word in Ephesians 5:21. First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another." Ephesians 5:21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ." Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones. The Lord Jesus said that He is our only Leader (Matt. 23:10). The elders should not "lord it over" the saints (1 Pet. 5:3). There is no lord among us but the Lord Jesus. Do not think that you are the one who can lord it over the whole congregation. That is absolutely wrong. Such an attitude, way of thinking, and practice are altogether ugly. We must avoid this. The elders need to set up a pattern by taking the lead to serve and care for the church so that the believers may follow (v. 3).</P><P>Third, we should not try to adjust people. I may be wrong in a meeting, and you may realize that I am wrong, but you should not adjust me in the meeting. If you feel burdened, you could come to me and have a nice fellowship with me. We may think that others are wrong, but we may be wrong. We may have misunderstood someone and missed the context of what they said. It is best not to adjust anyone in the meeting. Such adjustment kills the function of the saints, and it also kills the morale and the encouragement. Be very careful about correcting and adjusting others. If someone says something wrong, it is better to let it go. People will learn. By practicing to function in the meetings, they will learn how to function to build up the Body of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>KNOWING THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4; Acts 2:42; 15:1-34; Rom. 15:25-27; 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19; 1 Cor. 1:12; Gal. 2:8-9; Acts 18:24; 19:1a; 1 Cor. 1:12; 4:6; 16:12</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your economy and for Your sovereignty over us today that we all could be gathered together at this time and in this place. Lord, we are all here waiting on You. Lord, thank You that You have opened up Your Word in these days to us. We need Your Spirit, the Spirit of grace, and even the Spirit of supplication, that we may pray to You to receive Yourself as our grace. Lord, tonight we look unto You for a living revelation. Unveil Yourself to us and expose us. Lord, we want to know You. In the light of knowing You, we want to see ourselves. Lord Jesus, we want to be adjusted once more. O Lord, we like to be remodeled. Transform us in the view concerning Your Body, Your church, which is Your heart's desire. Lord, we want to know You in this desire&#151;not in our thinking, in our interest, but in what You want. Lord, do speak to us. Lord, quiet us and give us a heart which is open to You.</P><P>We want to see what You want us to do and to be in these last, crucial days. Lord, we pray for Your move to Europe, even to eastern Europe. We pray for Your step, which includes us. Deeply work in us that we may cooperate with You to go together with You. O Lord Jesus, be the Angel of Jehovah to escort us to Europe&#151;to eastern Germany and to Russia&#151;that You would have a people to carry out Your plan even today. Lord, cover us. We hide ourselves in You and hide ourselves under the cleansing of Your precious blood, the prevailing blood, which protects us against all the enemy's devices. Lord, rebuke him as You did before Joshua. We need Your cleansing; we even need Your purification. O Lord Jesus, we do not trust in what we can say or in what we can do. We still trust in Your mercy. Lord, grant us Your rich blessing. Lord, we like these three names in Zechariah 1:1&#151;at an appointed time [Iddo] Jehovah will bless [Berechiah] and Jehovah will remember [Zechariah]. Lord, we believe this is the appointed time. Lord, bless us and remember us. Lord Jesus, we put our full trust in You. We have absolutely no trust in ourselves. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROBLEMS OF PRIDE,<br>THE THOUGHT OF BEING A HERO, AND OPINIONS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Problem of Pride with the Young Ones</H2><P>I am happy that we could be together in this elders' meeting. This is probably the biggest elders' meeting we have had in the United States. There are five hundred thirty brothers here in attendance. I noticed that many young ones are among the elders. I am happy about this, but I am also quite concerned. Paul's charge to us is that the "new hands" should be considered carefully before being brought into the realm, the circle, of the eldership. In 1 Timothy 3:6 Paul says that an overseer should not be a novice, or a new convert.</P><P>On the other hand, there need to be learners in the eldership. Learning spiritual things may be likened to learning a language. It is easier for a young person to learn a new language. An older person may learn a new language, but it is difficult for him to get rid of his accent. In this sense, it is very good to have young ones in the eldership. However, I also want to warn the young ones. I have passed through your age, and I do know what is in a young man that can be a possible problem. This does not mean that we older ones do not have any problem. We have our problem, the middle-aged brothers have their problem, and the young brothers have their problem. Every age group has its problems.</P><P>When you are young, the problem is your pride. It is hard for the young people to avoid pride. In the past sixty to seventy years, I have been watching over the recovery and the world situation. I have discovered that pride is the problem with the young people. In the past seventy years, the Lord brought in some brilliant, marvelous, excellent young ones among us. However, about eighty percent of the brilliant young ones whom the Lord brought into our realm were spoiled by their pride. Thus, we are short of hands today.</P><P>Because the recovery is real and rich in truth, the entire world is open to the recovery. Especially, I would say that all of Central America and South America, with Puerto Rico and the Caribbean Islands, are open to us. We have so many requests from these places for some to come and help them. This has become our burden. We cannot bear this much. We are short of hands. If we had fifty co-workers who would be able to go to help meet the present demand, it still would not be sufficient. In New Zealand, Australia, Korea, and southeastern Asia, there is also the need.</P><P>I received a letter three days ago from a brother in Mongolia. I want to report to you that there is a local church of about twenty-five saints there in the recovery. Most of them are either students or professors in the universities. The way they meet and serve is absolutely in the new way. They have also asked for some to come there to help. These ones in Mongolia are open and eager to know the Bible and to know the Lord. Who will go to them? This shows again that the door is wide open to the Lord's recovery.</P><P>The door is also wide open to the Lord's recovery in Russia. We have signed the order to have altogether one and a half million books printed in Russian. Some brothers there promised us that they had the means to distribute these books all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok. If one hundred proper brothers (not only qualified but also proper) went there, fifty churches could be raised up within a short time. But where are the proper brothers among us? Throughout the years, we have had many promising young ones, many crops, but when they were growing up, they got cut off by their pride.</P><P>The turmoil through which we have recently passed has become a cycle in the Lord's recovery. Nearly every seven to ten years there has been a turmoil to damage the crop. In 1978 there was a storm which cut off some good brothers. Then three years ago there was another turmoil. Some useful ones were cut off through this recent turmoil.</P><P>In the past Brother Nee warned us. He said that many pieces of pottery will be broken in the process of finishing the pottery. These ones who have been involved in this recent turmoil have been spoiled like this broken pottery. These dear ones could have been very useful, but their potential usefulness has been spoiled.</P><P>At the beginning of their church life in the recovery, they were quite humble and poor in spirit. They were under the ministry to be taught, nourished, and raised up. They really learned something, and they had a certain capacity from the Lord by His mercy. But they eventually began to be deceived, trying to overthrow the present ministry in the Lord's recovery. They were like a crop going on quite well, a crop which gave much expectation to the farmers. But a hailstorm came suddenly to damage that crop. This happened during my absence from the United States. A hailstorm came and damaged the crop. Once the crop gets damaged in this way, there is no way to recover it.</P><P>I have seen this several times in our history in the Lord's recovery in mainland China. When I was sent out of mainland China, we did not have many useful, proper brothers to bear the burden because of this kind of continual damage through pride. The enemy damages the recovery firstly by people's pride.</P><P>This is why I want to warn the young ones. Today a young brother may be very humble and obedient because he is learning. But we do not have the assurance that he will be the same after seven or ten years. We do not know what the result will be with this young brother. Pride is a big killer used by Satan. Satan may not take advantage of a young one while he is learning. But after a number of years, when this brother is just entering into the years of being useful in the hand of the Lord, Satan will seek to take him as prey through his pride. This is why we are short of hands today in this time of urgent need. I hope that you young people would be impressed that the enemy is crouching, waiting for the opportunity to take you as his prey. After some years, you will have learned something, and some capacity will be there. You will be useful. That will be the time for you to get caught by the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Problem of the Thought of Being a Hero<br>with the Middle-aged Ones</H2><P>There is also a problem with the middle-aged ones. In this elders' meeting, I have been prepared by the Lord to say something very practical to the three age groups&#151;the young people, the middle-aged brothers, and the old brothers. What is the trouble with the middle-aged brothers? A certain brother may have come into the church life when he was twenty-two. Now that he is forty years old, he praises the Lord for His mercy in keeping him in His recovery. He is thankful to the Lord for His ministry by which he has been nourished, educated, perfected, and equipped. Now he has the attitude that he knows something and can do something. Then what is the trouble? Satan is subtle. He can use anything according to your age to get you as his prey. The middle-aged brothers, after staying in the Lord's recovery about eighteen to twenty years, may consider themselves as  heroes in the recovery. They feel that the recovery cannot be short of them.</P><P>Because I have passed through the Lord's recovery as a young and middle-aged person, I understand these problems. I dropped my job in 1933 so that I could serve the Lord with all of my time. I was humble, because I did not know much about life, the Spirit, Christ, or the church as the Body of Christ. Of course, by that time I had acquired much knowledge about the types and prophecies in the Old Testament. I knew that Christ was my Savior, but I never knew that He was God's centrality and universality. Brother Nee was only two years older than I. Sister Faith Chang observed my relationship with him and testified that I was to Brother Nee just like a son to a father.</P><P>After ten years of being with Brother Nee, from 1933 to 1943, I learned a lot. In 1943, after I had been somewhat perfected and equipped, I became very sick. That was actually the mercy of the Lord. The Japanese put me into prison for one month. After I came out of prison, I got tuberculosis and nearly died. The Lord in His mercy put me into this sickness for two and a half years. I learned a lot in that time. During that time, I saw the tree of life. This took place when I was forty years old. In 1944 I left Chefoo, my hometown. Since then up to now, I have not returned there.</P><P>The lesson that I have learned with the middle-aged brothers is their thinking that they may be the hero, that they may be somebody in the recovery, and that the young ones should listen to them. If you think this way, sooner or later, a day will come when the crouching enemy will take you as his prey. Then you are finished. I thank the Lord that He delivered me out of that snare.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Problem of Opinions with the Old Ones</H2><P>Now I am in my old age. I know the problems with the elderly brothers. The problem with those in their old age is opinions. An old brother feels that he has the experience. He has passed through the problems of the young and middle-aged brothers. Now he has learned a lot. If some want to act, he will say not to because of his experience. His opinions hinder the work. The older ones can hinder the going on of a church because of their opinions.</P><P>Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions have been used by the enemy among us in the past seventy years. I am sorry that Brother Nee is not here. If he were here, he would nod his head again and again to my word. He would tell you that I am altogether right.</P><P>To illustrate what I have been saying, I would like to relate something of our history. I was sent by the work to Taiwan in 1949. In the spring of 1950, Brother Nee came out of mainland China to Hong Kong, and he brought in a revival there. He contacted me and asked me to come to Hong Kong from Taiwan to help. The next morning he brought me to the service meeting, which included the elders, deacons, and co-workers. He brought me in and said, "Brother Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, make full arrangements for all the service concerning the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons." Later, a small group was formed to take care of the purchase of some land for the building of a hall. Brother Nee found out that this group, mostly of older brothers, was full of opinions. One day, Brother Nee took the opportunity in his wisdom to tell this group, "Concerning the purchase of land and the building up of the hall, you have to listen to whatever Brother Lee says." They all agreed to this.</P><P>Soon after this, I was invited by this group to an older brother's home for a love feast. This older brother was full of experiences. These experiences had become his opinions. After we had started to eat, they said that they were begging me for permission to buy only one acre of land. I had told them previously to buy two acres of land, but they thought this might be too much.</P><P>I told them that since the church in Hong Kong was their church, this was their business. But I also told them that if they were going to buy a piece of land in a big city like Hong Kong, they should buy it in a sufficient way. I warned them that after buying the land, it would be very difficult for them to go back to get additional land. They still decided to purchase only one acre. After they made the plans for the hall, they found out that one acre was insufficient. Then they tried their best to go back and get more land. They did everything they could, but they were only able to get a little bit more property. This illustrates how the Lord's work can suffer because of opinion.</P><P>In the recovery we have been suffering and suffering from 1922 up to now because of these three things: the pride of the younger ones, the thought of being a hero of the middle-aged ones, and the opinions of the older ones. Everything may be all right with us now, but these problems are within us. All of us need to be warned. If we are younger ones, we should be warned of pride. If we are in middle age, we should learn to be nothing. We should not wear a "mask" in the eldership. We should be what we are. When we are older, we should remember that the problem with older people is opinion.</P><P>There are a number of brothers working with me to carry out the full-time training. Sometimes, although I have had the proper way to go on, I did not say anything. Because the brothers helping me expressed a way which was quite different from my way, I would not say a word. The frustration of opinions can be illustrated by five brothers taking one car to go to Los Angeles. The first decision they have to make is who the driver will be. If they have not been dealt with by the cross, this decision could take much time. Once this is decided upon, the driver may ask what way he should take. The opinions expressed concerning what way to take can also take much time. This waste of time hinders, frustrates, and delays them from arriving at their destination. This is why we should be exercised not to express any opinion if we are not the "driver." My point is this&#151;if the elders in the eldership are not one, sooner or later, they will "kill" themselves. This has been the situation among us in a number of places.</P><P>There may be three brothers in the eldership in a certain locality&#151;one is older, one is younger, and the other one is middle-aged. Thus, the three problems of pride, thinking that one is a hero, and opinions are all there. When these problems are present in the eldership, the eldership is finished. I would like to ask the elders if they are in oneness in their locality. Those who think they are a hero may wear a mask, feeling that they can convince everyone and subdue everyone. This is terrible. If this is the case, can the church in this locality be built up? The church is torn down by these kinds of problems.</P><P>Brothers, you need to realize that to be a person in the eldership in the Lord's recovery is a serious thing. If you are young, beware of your pride. If you are in middle age, beware of your thinking that you are the hero, the strong one among the others. If you are an older one, beware of your opinions. In the eldership there should be no pride, no thought of being a hero, and no opinions. There should be only truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ. We do not want to know anything else.</P><P>In the past two years of the full-time training in Anaheim, I can testify that I and all the trainers did not have anything other than the truth, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, the Body of Christ. Thus, the blessing has been here. When we practice the one accord, our name will be Iddo, Berechiah, and Zechariah (Zech. 1:1), meaning that at the appointed time Jehovah blesses and Jehovah remembers. In some localities there is no blessing because some of the brothers wear a mask. They are not honest, sincere, and genuine. Do you think that the Lord will bless you and remember you if you are like this?</P><P>We should be serious in taking the eldership in the recovery. We have to fear the Lord as our Head. In the church life, we all have to learn to be subject one to another. Not only should the young ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the young ones in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21; 1 Pet. 5:5). This means that we should honor and regard Christ as the Head. In the church, we are not the head. He is the Head, and we should be careful not to offend Him.</P><P>We need to be aware of the seriousness of being in the eldership. The young ones should hate their pride; the middle-aged ones should hate the thinking that they are heroic; and the old ones should hate their opinions. We should try the best to fulfill our duty in this way under His economy. Due to our past history, I feel that what I have spoken here as a warning is needed. If we remain in the recovery in our pride, our thought of being a hero, or our opinions, we will be the first ones to suffer, and we will cause the church to suffer.</P><P>Some middle-aged brothers wear a mask in the eldership. A mask is a falsehood; it is hypocrisy. To appear in a way other than what you really are is to wear a mask. In front of one person, you may act one way. Then in front of another person, you will act in another way. This kind of pretense is hateful in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord likes to see truthfulness, sincerity, and faithfulness. In the eldership one of the most important lessons to learn is to be truthful, faithful, and sincere. We should not be two-faced. We should be one person with one genuine face. To be hypocritical cuts off your future in the recovery. The Lord knows our heart. The ones who last in the eldership are those who are honest, faithful, truthful, and sincere.</P><P>My burden in this elders' meeting is to try my best to fellowship with you all concerning the real problem among us today. Pride, the thought of being a hero, and opinions are the factors working something out secretly to damage one thing&#151;the Body of Christ. As long as I am proud, the Body of Christ is through with me. As long as I am thinking that I am the one who is a hero, the Body of Christ is gone. If opinion is here, the Body of Christ is frustrated. If we are in any of these three items, the Body is annulled.</P><P>In fact Christ does have a Body, but in practicality this Body has been crippled, annulled, and to some extent destroyed. Christ does have a Body, but where is the proper Body? Where is the Body that functions? If you have one of these three problems&#151;pride, the thought of being a hero, or opinions&#151;in practicality the Body is absent in your locality. When your problem is present, the Body of Christ is absent.</P><P>Now we want to see two crucial points concerning knowing the Body. We need to know the Body in the Spirit and in practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One Body, One Spirit</H2><P>Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." The Spirit is the essence and the reality of the Body. In doctrine, it may not seem so good to say that the Spirit is the Body, but in actuality the Spirit is the Body. If you are proud, the Spirit is absent, so the Body is not here. If you are opinionated, the Body cannot be here either, because your opinions are enemies to the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Local Churches<br>Being the One, Unique Universal Church</H2><P>Just because a group of believers are meeting in your locality, it does not mean that the Body is there. Today on this earth, there are many Christian groups. You may have the thought that your local church has nothing to do with other churches and should not be in any connection with other churches. This thought isolates your local church, making it no longer a part of the Body of Christ. The Body is unique in the whole universe. There may be thousands of local churches, but there is still just one Body. All the local churches are the one, unique universal church, the one Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Local Churches<br>Having the Same One Spirit</H2><P>Furthermore, all the local churches possess the same one Spirit. The Spirit is uniquely one. There is no local Spirit; there is no local Christ; there is no local God; and there is no local Bible. Moreover, the apostles' teaching is not local, and the apostles' fellowship is not local (Acts 2:42). All the basic things for the Body are not local. Some of the business affairs may be merely local matters, but we need to realize that all the local churches are the one, unique universal church, and they all have the same one Spirit. In this light we need to reconsider our present understanding of the church. Our understanding of the church may be unbalanced.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN PRACTICE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Locality as the Church Ground of a Local Church<br>Separating the Church in Existence<br>but Not Dividing the Church in Essence</H2><P>We also need to know the Body in practice. Locality as the church ground of a local church separates the church in existence but does not divide the church in essence. The existence of the churches is separated, but their essence is inseparable. The saints who live in Atlanta and those who live in Anaheim cannot come together always as one church. This is impossible. For the sake of existence, the local churches are separate. The saints who live in Atlanta have to be the church there, and the brothers and sisters in Anaheim have to be the church here. This is a separation for the purpose of existence, but this has nothing to do with the essence. The church in Atlanta, the church in Anaheim, and all the local churches are one Body in essence. Essentially, we are still just one Body on the entire globe. Our thought needs to be revolutionized. We should consider our local church as a part of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Regions of the Work</H2><P>Brother Nee taught about the regions of the work in his book Further Talks on the Church Life (see chapter six entitled "The Way for the Work Hereafter"&#151;pp. 153-170). We have to realize that in the New Testament, for the apostles' work, there were only two regions. One was the Jewish world, and the other was the Gentile world. In these two regions, there were no sub-regions.</P><P>Peter was working in the Jewish region, and that area was relatively small. But the Gentile world in which Paul worked was vast with different countries. These different countries, such as Asia Minor, Greece, and Macedonia, were different geographical regions. Rome with its surrounding areas could also be considered as a geographical region. But the New Testament does not have this kind of consideration concerning the work. In the Gentile world, there was only one region with one group of co-workers.</P><P>Did Paul, because of the vastness of his region, let some brothers take care of the work in Rome and another group take care of Greece with Macedonia? There was not such a thing. There were not different groups of workers under Paul taking care of specific regions or sub-regions. Paul and those with him were altogether just one group.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Regions of the Work<br>Not Dividing the Churches</H2><P>The regions of the work should not divide the churches. There were regions in Paul's time, the Jewish and the Gentile, but they never divided the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Churches in the Gentile World<br>Having Fellowship<br>with Those in the Jewish World</H2><P>The churches in the Gentile world had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in solving the problems in teaching (Acts 15:1-34). Some taught circumcision as a term for eternal salvation. That was wrong. Paul, however, did not have the attitude of merely solving this problem in Antioch. Rather, he, Barnabas, and some others went to Jerusalem to get the problem solved by all the churches. That decision eventually became an epistle written by the apostles and elders. This epistle was not designated as being written by the Gentile and Jewish apostles and by the Gentile and Jewish elders. Acts 15 says that it was written simply by the apostles and the elders (v. 23), including the apostles and elders of both the Jewish and Gentile churches. They were considered as one. We have to see this.</P><P>The churches in the Gentile world also had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in supplying the physical need (Rom. 15:25-27). The apostle Paul was endeavoring to raise up financial help, physical help, from the Gentile saints for the Jewish saints. In this fellowship they were considered as one, but I do not think our attitude today is like this. Sometimes we help other churches, but there is the consideration that we have to take care of the need of the local churches in our area first. If we have some surplus, then we will consider giving something to other churches. But Paul's practice was not like this. Paul knew that the saints in Macedonia were in poverty, yet he still encouraged them to give. Their giving was their fellowship of concern to help the churches in the Jewish world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Paul, Who Worked<br>in the Gentile World, Being Concerned<br>for the Church in Jerusalem</H2><P>Furthermore, Paul, who worked in the Gentile world, was concerned for the church in Jerusalem (Rom. 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19). He had a heavy burden to help the church in Jerusalem to enter into God's New Testament economy. Although the Spirit inspired the saints to warn him not to go to Jerusalem, he said that he did not care for his life. He had purposed in his spirit to go there. No doubt, he went there with a burden to help the saints get out of the law in the Old Testament economy and enter into the New Testament economy of God to have the church. This shows us again that the regions of the work should not divide the churches. I called a number of urgent elders' meetings beginning in 1984 because I realized that there was the tendency of division among us. If we know the Body of Christ, however, we cannot be divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Peter, Who Worked in the Jewish World,<br>Being Accepted by the Church in Corinth<br>in the Gentile World</H2><P>Peter, who worked in the Jewish world, was also accepted by the church in Corinth in the Gentile world (1 Cor. 1:12; Gal. 2:9). His teaching, his work, was accepted by the church in Corinth. Otherwise, some of them would not have been able to say that they were of Cephas. Since some of the Corinthian saints said this, that is a strong evidence that Peter's ministry and teaching were accepted by the Gentile world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Co-workers in the Jewish World<br>and Those in the Gentile World Having<br>Pleasant and Sweet Fellowship with One Another</H2><P>The co-workers in the Jewish world and those in the Gentile world had pleasant and sweet fellowship with one another. Galatians 2:8 and 9 record that Paul and Barnabas had fellowship with James, Cephas, and John. They did not consider themselves to be separated from one another. They considered themselves as one in the divine fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Apollos Being Received and Accepted<br>by the Brothers in the Gentile World</H2><P>Apollos was received and accepted by the brothers in the Gentile world (Acts 18:24; 19:1a; 1 Cor. 1:12; 4:6; 16:12).</P><P>In the light of this fellowship, we need to realize that our present situation is not so scriptural. I picked up all the above points to present a portrait of the situation at the time of the early apostles. The churches were all one in the Spirit and in practice, but it is not so much like this today among us.</P><P>All the above points show that all the co-workers in all the regions should do the same one work universally for the unique Body. We should do only one work. There should not be several works in the Lord's recovery. In the past there were several works in the recovery. This is still lingering among us. There is the risk and the danger that these different works will issue in divisions. We have to consider our present situation so that we can eliminate the number of works. The work should be just one. Even Paul and Peter did not carry out two works. Even though they worked in different regions, they had only one work to build up the Body of Christ.</P><P>I am concerned that in the Lord's recovery, the brothers in a certain country may consider that the work there is their work. Then some brothers in another country may consider that the work there is their work. Thus, we have many works. This shows that our situation today is abnormal, yet probably not many of us have the sensation of abnormality in the recovery. There is a practical situation that is abnormal, and the biggest point of this abnormality is the different works.</P><P>I hope that we will consider our present situation before the Lord. Are we doing the same one work for the recovery? If not, we should let the Lord have the freedom to adjust us. Thank the Lord that due to the riches of the truth, the Lord's recovery is being welcomed everywhere on the earth. In the Lord's move in His recovery, there should only be one work, not different works. Our situation is different from this. We have different works without any consciousness. This is dangerous.</P><P>In Paul's time, because of the lack of modern transportation and communication, it would have been logical to have the work divided. However, there was only one work. Today the globe has been made small by modern conveniences. All the modern conveniences have made the globe just like a city. Despite this we do not have one work but many works. If we stay in this situation, a negative result may come out eventually. We do have an existing problem among us. I hope that we would reconsider our situation.</P><P>The two problems that are bothering me very much concern the eldership and the number of works. In the eldership all the brothers in the different age groups have to deal with the Lord concerning their pride, their thought of being a hero, and their opinions. The different works also need to be eliminated. As long as we have these two problems, the recovery cannot be that healthy or that prevailing. We must look to the Lord that these two things will be absent among us. Then I assure you that the recovery will be healthy and prevailing, and the increase surely will come. Furthermore, even in life, the standard, the level, will be greatly uplifted.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>KEEPING THE ONENESS<br>OF THE BODY AND MAINTAINING<br>A GOOD ORDER IN THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-3; 5:21; 1 Pet. 5:5; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6</H1><P>In this chapter we want to see more concerning knowing the Body. If we want to be those who are in the practicality of the Body, we need to keep the oneness of the Body and maintain a good order in the Body. Although the verses in the Scripture reading may be familiar to us, I would like to point out two of them. Ephesians 5:21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ." First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."</P><P>In the previous chapter, I touched three problems that have been among us&#151;pride (mostly among the young people), heroism (mostly among the middle-aged), and opinions (mostly among the older ones). In our fellowship in this message, we want to address a few problems which have been existing among us for years. Until these problems are solved and removed, the church life will not have much peace, and the recovery will be greatly devastated. We expect to have the proper increase and the growth in life. But due to these problems, the church has been greatly limited in the increase and delayed in the growth in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO CARE FOR<br>THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Throughout the years, we have found out that regardless of how much we teach about the oneness of the Body, some among us would not take care of this oneness. When I was in the Lord's work in mainland China, I saw a number of turmoils. Thank the Lord that I was preserved from any involvement in these turmoils. Eventually, the Lord sent me to Taiwan. In Taiwan there was one serious turmoil which took place from 1957 to 1965. In 1978 we had a turmoil in the recovery in the United States. Then nine years later, in 1987, we had a second turmoil. This turmoil is still lingering among us. It has not altogether passed away. Because of this, I want us to see the root of this problem. The source, or the root, of this present turmoil is the carelessness in our regard for the oneness of the Body. We have taught much concerning the Body, and we have printed many books concerning the Body, but when a certain situation arises, not many would take care of the Body. To take care of the Body is to take care of the oneness. If the oneness is gone, the Body is finished. No oneness&#151;no Body. The Body can only exist and survive in the oneness.</P><P>Today in all of Christianity, the reality of the Body is absent because there is no oneness. In the Catholic Church there is a so-called oneness that is humanly manufactured. The word catholic means universally one. This so-called oneness has been maintained by the organizational papal system. This is a man-made, manufactured oneness. This is not the real oneness. After Luther was raised up by the Lord, the state, or national, churches were eventually formed, such as the Church of Germany, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Norway, and the Church of England. Through the formation of these national churches and the Protestant denominations, the oneness was slaughtered. Because the Lord's seeking ones realized that the Catholic Church and the national churches were off, they tried their best to keep the truth which they had seen and to recover this truth. As a result, division after division was continually formed. Based upon this principle, the Presbyterian church came into existence because some desired to keep the truth of the presbytery. This is the truth concerning the churches being managed and administrated under a group of elders. The Baptists saw the truth of baptism by immersion, so they formed the Baptist church. Even the Baptists are divided among themselves. Today there are the Southern Baptists, the American Baptists, and the Conservative Baptists. There are many, many so-called private churches today. There are also many free groups.</P><P>In the eighteenth century, Zinzendorf took the lead in the recovery of the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit. In the nineteenth century, the British Brethren were raised up by the Lord, and they saw many truths. However, they were too occupied with doctrine according to the letter. Due to this, they were divided. The first division among them took place because of a disagreement between Darby and Newton over the person of Christ and over the rapture and second coming of Christ.</P><P>Another problem among the Brethren was concerning whether or not the recovered church should receive those saints who still remained in the denominations. George Muller felt that these saints should be received. He pointed out that some who remained in the denominations, such as Hudson Taylor, were spiritual, seeking after the Lord, and living a high standard of the Christian life. Hudson Taylor tried his best to avoid the formation of another denomination. The China Inland Mission which he formed was a mission established for going into the interior of China to save sinners. Despite what Hudson Taylor endeavored to do, China Inland Mission churches were eventually formed, established, and built up. Thus, according to the view of the Brethren, Hudson Taylor formed another denomination. Darby argued that such people might be spiritual, but because they still remained in the denominations, they had to be called evil companions. This debate concerning the receiving of the saints caused further division among the Brethren.</P><P>At this point in our fellowship concerning knowing the Body, I would like to add a word concerning those saints whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life. Madame Guyon was the one who took the lead in this recovery in the seventeenth century. However, although she was so spiritual and in life, she still went to the image of Mary. The preface of her biography said something concerning her doing this. When we translated this biography into Chinese over fifty years ago, a brother among us had the thought of including this preface, but we did not agree with this. Her life with the Lord was very good, but the truth was not that complete to her. We could not publish such a preface in the Chinese version of her biography. I am sharing this to impress us that we should not trust in people's spirituality. Spirituality is conditional. How spiritual is it to be spiritual? If you say that someone is very good, how good is very good? You may be very spiritual today, but how will you be ten years later? Because spirituality is conditional, it should not be taken as a base or as a standard. The base and the standard must be the truth. The truth is not conditional. It is the fact.</P><P>In 1957 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to us in Taiwan for the second time. We had a few sessions with him to talk about the matter of spirituality and the truth concerning the church. Dr. Chang Yu-lan, who is now with the Lord, pointed out that there were a number of meetings in Taipei all of which claimed to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then he asked Brother Austin-Sparks which one of these meetings could be considered as the church in Taipei. Brother Austin-Sparks said strongly that the ones who have more of Christ are the ones who are more the church. At first I thought I should not be involved in this discussion, since I was the translator. Eventually, I realized that I had to say something; otherwise, the issue would not be resolved.</P><P>I pointed out that Christ is the element, the reality, and the center of the church. Because of this, we might mistakenly think that those who have more of Christ are more the church. Although this seems to be correct, I showed that this was wrong. I pointed out the example of Madame Guyon. She had much of Christ, but she still remained in the Catholic Church. Could we say that because she had much of Christ, she was right concerning the church? Then I pointed out how Brother Austin-Sparks referred to F.B. Meyer in his messages. Although F.B. Meyer was very spiritual, he still remained in a denomination. He worked for and built up that denomination. Could we say that because Brother Meyer had much of Christ, he was right concerning the church? My speaking refuted what Brother Austin-Sparks said. My illustrations showed that we should not say that the more of Christ you have, the more you are the church.</P><P>Brother Austin-Sparks visited us in Taiwan in 1955 and in 1957. He took many pictures during his first visit and he showed these slides to people when he returned to England. He said that in his entire life, he never had such a marvelous congregation as he had in Taiwan. He visited us again in 1957, and this is when the problem with him arose over the truth concerning the ground of the church. When he returned he told people that I was too much for the church ground. I told people, however, that I was not yet enough for the church ground. The church should be measured by the ground of locality and by the reality of the Spirit of oneness. It should not be measured by people's spirituality. Spirituality is relative and conditional.</P><P>Brother Austin-Sparks's second visit to us created a big problem, and all the saints were tested. Some young co-workers who were raised up and taught by me were influenced by him. One of these young co-workers was even saved through me in Shanghai. They began to say that they just wanted Christ and did not care for the church. To just want Christ and not care for the church is divisive. Regardless of how much you care for Christ and have experienced Christ, if you meet in a way that does not care for the truth of the church, your meeting is a division.</P><P>These divisive ones proclaimed that they had seen the church in glory. They condemned me and some other brothers as old men who did not have visions. They felt that they had the vision. I had a long talk with them. I told them that if they did not take care of the truth concerning the church, especially the church ground, they would be divided again and again after they left the recovery. What I said to them came to pass.</P><P>I began to warn them in 1959, and we tolerated them until 1965. During those years, they were causing trouble among the churches. The leading brothers wrote me a letter in 1965 asking me to return to Taiwan from the United States to solve this problem. They said that I was the only person who had the ground, the position, and the right to deal with this problem because the work in Taiwan was started by the Lord through me. I eventually returned to Taiwan in 1965, and this problem with these rebellious ones was solved.</P><P>How can such things take place among us? They can take place because the ones involved do not care for the Body, for the oneness. Regardless of how many visions someone has seen, he has no right to build up any division. I hope that we all can see this. Paul and Peter encountered the trouble concerning circumcision recorded in Acts 15, but they did not have any division. They tried their best to get the problem solved in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of all the local churches in both the Jewish and Gentile territories. Thus, the churches kept the oneness, and there was no division. In 1987 rebellion and division began to occur with certain ones among us. Even if the accusations they made were true, however, that cannot be built up as a case to justify their division. One leading brother asked one of these rebellious ones about their meeting as a division in Anaheim. This one said that he would remove this division from Anaheim. But it does not matter where it is removed to. Wherever it is, it is still a division.</P><P>I must testify in honesty that I have been commissioned by the Lord to carry His truth and bring His recovery to the United States. The recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body. Even if these divisive ones move to a city in which there is not a church, they have to be checked concerning what kind of relationship they have with the other churches. One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches.</P><P>When these dissenting ones came to me, I told them that regardless of what they did, I would not make any division or set up new churches. But I also told them that I would not tolerate anything that was against the truth. Later, they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them, he should keep his hands off of these churches. I pointed out that Paul did not keep his hands off of the church in Ephesus. He established the church in Ephesus, appointed elders there, and went back to Ephesus. He stayed there at one time for three and a half years (Acts 20:17, 31). When he could not go to them personally, he wrote to them (Eph. 1:1). How could the apostles be commissioned only to set up the churches without building them up? This is altogether illogical and unscriptural.</P><P>When I shared this, they had no ground to teach concerning the so-called autonomy of a local church as put forth by G.H. Lang in his book The Churches of God. The church is not an organization that can practice autonomy. Even the United States, a nation of organization, cannot have absolute autonomy. In this country, the states do not have an autonomous defense, diplomacy, or postal system. The postal system, the diplomacy, and the defense of the country are national matters. Even in a nation like the United States, absolute autonomy cannot be practiced. The ones in this recent rebellion taught this because they wanted me to stay away from the churches. Their teaching issued in division.</P><P>Later, one of them said that there was not only one apostle but also a number of apostles. He said that he could present a list of the brothers among us who were apostles. Another brother asked him for this list. All of the ones on this list had been my students. After this I went to Taiwan and gave a message on the different kinds of apostles (see chapter two of A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need&#151;pp. 21-29). Because of what I presented, they changed and said that there were only twelve apostles&#151;eleven plus Paul. They said that the one selected in Acts 1, Matthias, was a wrong one. This was the old teaching of the Brethren. We knew this and rejected it many years ago. Brother Nee rejected this wrong teaching in The Normal Christian Church Life (see chapter one&#151;pp. 20-38). When they got to know this, they eventually said that there were no apostles. I said in the past that all the saints could function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This shows that the ones involved in this recent rebellion do not care for the truth. They do not care for the oneness, for the Body of Christ. We should not do anything without taking care of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>To keep the oneness of the Body is actually to keep the oneness of the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality and the essence of the Body. Paul says in Ephesians 4:3 that we should keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. Christ has abolished on the cross all the differences due to ordinances. In so doing, He has made peace for His Body. This peace should bind all believers together, thus becoming the uniting bond. There should never be any kind of fighting within the church. We need to keep the oneness by remaining in the uniting bond of peace.</P><P>Ephesians 4:2 says that we need to keep the oneness with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love. Lowliness is to remain in a low estate, and meekness is not to fight for oneself. We should have these two virtues in dealing with ourselves. Longsuffering is to endure mistreatment. We should have this virtue in dealing with others. By these virtues we bear one another. You have to bear me, and I have to bear you. This is what it means to walk worthily of the Lord's calling (Eph. 4:1b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Division Annulling the Body and the Recovery</H2><P>Any division annuls the Body. If the Body is annulled, the oneness is killed. Then the recovery is gone. What is the Lord's recovery? The Lord's recovery is the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAINTAINING A GOOD ORDER IN THE BODY</H2><P>In addition to keeping the oneness of the Body, we need to maintain a good order in the Body. The church is the highest entity in the universe with the top standard. Thus, we need to have a beautiful, pleasant order among us. If there is a problem among us, we have to take care of it in a biblical way. When a problem arose concerning circumcision, Paul and the brothers with him took care of it in the proper way. Acts 15 speaks of their going to see the brothers in Jerusalem. They came together in a proper way to give testimonies and to seek the Lord's leading. Eventually, the decision was made through Peter by James. Through Peter's testimony and by James's word, a conclusion was reached. They said that this conclusion seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to them (v. 28). This shows that the conclusion reached was by them and by the Spirit. This is the right way to solve a problem in the churches. We need to come together properly, pray, study the Word, and make a decision. By taking care of Christ and by taking care of His Body, we will avoid division, keep the oneness, and maintain a good order in the Body. I feel I must say this because another turmoil may suddenly rise up among us. We should not repeat anything of the past. Let us come together with an open spirit to pray together, get into the Word, and check our situation with the Word in fellowship. Then we can get a divine answer. This is the right way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Subject to One Another<br>in the Fear of Christ</H2><P>To keep a pleasant, good, and beautiful order in the recovery, we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21). Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones (1 Pet. 5:5). The elders should not be a special class in the church. Peter charges them not to lord it over the church (v. 3). On the other hand, the saints should respect the elders. The younger ones should respect the older ones, and the older ones should also respect the younger ones. The wives should respect the husbands, and the husbands should also respect the wives. Our subjection with respect is a mutual thing.</P><P>Not being subject to one another offends Christ as the Head. Actually, not being subject to one another is rebellion against the Head. This means that we have no fear of Christ in His headship. Paul tells us that we need to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, who is the Head. Only the Head is superior. Only the Head should be unique and different from the Body. None of the members, even the apostle Paul, is in a special or super class.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Subject to One Another<br>Being the Way to Keep the One Accord</H2><P>Being subject to one another is the way to keep the one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6). Even if your way is better, you should still take the other brother's way. Otherwise, there will be no one accord. If you are going to a place which has previously been under the work of some other co-workers, you should find out what has been taught by them. Then you should go along with them. If you do not care for what they have taught or done in the past and teach according to your preference, you will make trouble. We should always try to maintain a good, beautiful, nice, and pleasant order among us.</P><P>In February 1986 when I spoke concerning the one accord, I said that if some did not choose to take the God-ordained way, they should not criticize or oppose it. Otherwise, they would cause division. Thank the Lord that the church in Taipei has been fully turned to the God-ordained way. This turn was made after seven years of labor and ministry. When I returned to Taipei in 1984, we did not change the way to have the church meetings until more than three years later. Then we realized that the time was right to change from the way of one man speaking and the rest listening. We began to have a prophesying meeting, in which every attendant has equal opportunity to speak for the Lord. Thank the Lord that the majority of the saints in Taipei accepted this God-ordained way.</P><P>No one can deny that having a good speaker speak every Lord's Day helps people to a certain extent, but the annulling and killing of the saints' function is hidden in this practice. If someone takes the way of one man speaking and the rest listening for more than ten years, the ones under his speaking, who received much help, will be annulled in their function and their capacity of speaking for the Lord. Now that we are practicing the God-ordained way, many new ones among us are being raised up in a proper way to be functioning members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>For conferences or trainings, it is all right to have the ministry of the word. But for a brother to speak and the rest listen every Lord's Day in the church meetings annuls the functioning of the saints. Furthermore, everyone enjoys hearing the new ones speak. We like to hear them say something about Christ in their fresh way. If only a few brothers speak all the time, the riches in all the members of the Body of Christ cannot be released. In the God-ordained way, all the riches of Christ come out through His members. Then the church meetings are like a love feast with many different portions of food.</P><P>We need to drop the system of one man speaking and the rest listening and take the God-ordained way of having the church meetings in mutuality. The age has changed, and the tide of the Lord's move is here among us. If some try to maintain the old way, they will cause trouble, and eventually, they will be sifted. All the churches are endeavoring to fully enter into the God-ordained way. We do not want to see anyone go back to the old way. This will create trouble. I hope that we can all have a real turn to the new way, the God-ordained way. This is the tide of the Lord's move today, and we have no choice except to follow Him according to His way.</P><P>After passing through many experiences throughout the years, I feel that today is the most golden time. The entire world, especially eastern Europe and Russia, is open to the truths which have been released in the Lord's recovery. We need to learn the lessons from our past history so that we do not repeat the negative things. We have seen from the training on Zechariah that when the Lord comes back, the remnant of Israel will have learned the lessons. They will be empty and ready to take Christ as everything. We should learn to take care of Christ, His Body, and the truth. If we take care of these three things properly, there will be no problems. We should not let anything frustrate us from these three things. We should not take in anything or care for anything but Christ, His Body&#151;the church, and the truth.</P><P>As we take the Lord's new way to build up the church, we will be greatly blessed. We will enjoy the Lord as our rain much more than we did in the past (Zech. 10:1; Hosea 6:3). I hope that we will rise up to drop everything other than Christ and to carry Christ as our ark, to carry the Body of Christ as our tabernacle, and to follow the truth as our pillar of fire in the night and our pillar of cloud in the day. The past turmoils should be warnings and lessons to us. We do not want to repeat these things or be influenced by them. We have Christ, we have the church, and we have the truth. Let us go on in this way.</P><P>We need to maintain a good order in the Body by being subject to one another. Then we will keep the one accord without criticizing, without despising, and without opposing. We should respect one another, help one another, perfect one another in life, and complete one another in work. We should never despise or criticize others. Instead, we should always receive the help from others and return help to them. We want to be perfected and to perfect others. We should not think that our work is complete or consummate. We should want to be completed and helped by others. Then we can help others to complete their work. If we take this way, we will be greatly blessed by the Lord's dear, sweet presence. Then at His coming back we will be rewarded, and we will be His bride to match Him and to fight the war against Antichrist.</P><P>After the recent training on Daniel and Zechariah, the view in the Bible, the divine revelation, is so clear to us. Nothing counts and everything is vanity except God's economy with Christ as the center, the hub, and as the circumference, the rim, making us His members to constitute His Body and preparing us to be His bride so that we can return with Him to defeat Antichrist and his followers to bring in the kingdom of God as the great mountain which will fill the whole earth. This is the ultimate end of the divine revelation in the Bible. Since we have seen this, we should spontaneously forget everything in the past. We should go on with our Christ, who is God's centrality and universality, so that we can fulfill His heart's desire.</P></body></html>
