   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT OPENING THE WAY TO THE GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Old Testament causes man to see his inability, while the New Testament is the way God opens His grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever man realizes that he is poor, he will be open to receive the supply of God s abundant grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In short, every commandment and demand of God is to prove man s inability and incapability.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we bring all these commandments and demands to God, He immediately opens the way to transmit His supply to us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was once a wife who felt that she should confess to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was very hard for her to do because she was used to being a domineering wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Her will was very strong and she was very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Usually it is the wife who fears the husband, but in this case it was her husband who feared her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day, however, she felt that she was wrong and that she should confess to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet when she considered doing it, she encountered a few problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, she did not have much strength; second, she was afraid of losing her face; and third, because she had oppressed her husband in the past, she was afraid that her husband would turn around and oppress her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that point she felt that she could no longer be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She knew that being a Christian meant that she had to be enlightened by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She also knew that after she was enlightened by the Lord, she would have to deal with all the unpeaceful feelings within her conscience; if she did not, she would feel even more unpeaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So she decided, I will just be a casual Christian; I will just be what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of Christian is a typical Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their heart is very sincere, their words are true, and they feel sorrowful within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can we help people like this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to help them to know that all the commandments of the New Testament open the way to the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we receive a command from God, we should bring it back to Him and tell Him, O God, I cannot do it; I give You this command just as the disciples gave You the five loaves and two fish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am always incapable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I give Your command and myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, do whatever you think is good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I cannot do anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who practice coming to the Lord in such a way will be blessed and will receive the bountiful supply from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This can be compared to the disciples bringing the five loaves and two fish to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As soon as they did this, the riches were manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that the miracle of five loaves and two fish is the only miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every time that God leads us to obey His command, it is also a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the Lord does not perform a miracle in us, we cannot do anything and we do not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may be at our end, yet the Lord causes the dead to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time that we keep the Lord s command, He definitely is performing a great miracle in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should always believe God, because He would never wrong us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we feel that we have wronged our husband, we should confess our sins to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we cannot do it, we have to give ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord will absolutely take care of the result.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not need to be anxious or to doubt anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord s grace is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not able to do many things, but after we pray, consecrate ourselves to the Lord, and put ourselves into the Lord s gracious hands, there will be an indescribable force welling up within us urging us to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may not even utter anything, but our tears will flow down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As this is happening, we will not feel ashamed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will only feel that we are filled with God and that we are full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps for this reason the person that we are confessing to may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>AS LONG AS WE ARE WILLING, GOD IS ABLE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the commandments of the New Testament are the same as the laws of the Old Testament they are God s demand on man, requiring man to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s demands in the New Testament, however, are not meant to be fulfilled by man alone but are meant to be fulfilled by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can we ask a patient with tuberculosis to walk to Kaohsiung?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If he wants to go to Kaohsiung, we have to let him fly or at least go by train.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not allow him to exert any energy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today many children of God do not understand that God s New Testament commandments and grace are altogether not a matter of our ability, but a matter of our willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are willing, we will bring all our inability and incapability to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as we are willing, God is able.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we place ourselves into the hands of God, He will have a way to perform signs and wonders in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we find it burdensome to confess our sins, to deal with our sins and conscience, and to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we should not lose heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Testament, as long as we are willing to obey God s demand and put ourselves in the hands of God, God will enable us in the midst of our inability.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we will be able to see God s presence, God s grace, and God s eternal glory.</S>
