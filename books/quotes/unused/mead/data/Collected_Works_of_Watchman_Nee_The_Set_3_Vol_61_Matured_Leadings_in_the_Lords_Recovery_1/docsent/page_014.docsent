   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING ABLE TO PERFECT OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to raise up the one-talented ones, instead of letting their talent remain hidden in the earth, there is the need of perfecting trainings and spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need prayer meetings and Bible-study meetings that perfect men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In perfecting the saints, we should not select just the ones who are in high positions, who have money, who have worldly experience, or who are competent in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we should choose those who have spiritual perception, spiritual understanding, and who have made spiritual advancements.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, they have to be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a brother in Shanghai who is not very capable, but he has spiritual perception, and his understanding is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is actually more qualified than many so-called experienced ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way to judge a man is to see if he is consecrated, if he has spiritual perception, and if his heart is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some are willing to consecrate in this way, but they are not very smart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among those who meet these qualifications, we have to select a few.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to work on them particularly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes we have to work on them together, and sometimes we have to work on them separately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They all must be able to do better than us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not matter if they do not do well in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a few times they will improve.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fallen mentality thinks that only we ourselves can do a job, but we have to perfect others to do it and help them to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perfect a few, and then charge them to help others to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The four Gospels show us clearly that the Lord did not commit Himself to everyone; He only committed Himself to the twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The twelve then committed themselves to the hundred and twenty, who committed themselves to three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First John 1:3 says that the disciples have fellowship with the apostles who have fellowship with the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to learn from the example of the Lord Jesus and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is an agricultural seminar, it is difficult to ask the president of the country to be the chairman.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there is a symposium of doctors, it is difficult to ask the governor of Hong Kong to be the chairman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if these dignitaries came, they could only sit in the last row.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, it would be difficult for us to actively participate in a worldly convention.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we join them, we could only be passive spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in spiritual matters, we cannot deny that we have learned more things than some other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may be more capable and experienced than we are, but they have to sit in the back to listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul charged Timothy to take the lead in Ephesus, and he reminded him to not let others despise his youth in particular, knowing from which ones he had learned 1 Tim 4:12; 2 Tim 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never measure a man according to worldly standards.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In summary, we have to find men who are perfect in heart and who have spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not worry about their age; pay attention to their consecration and spiritual perception.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man does not have spiritual perception, he is of little use in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can perfect a few people one at a time, or we can gather them together and teach them as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul not only edified the church; he also raised up a few individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wrote to the church in Corinth, but he also wrote to individuals such as Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He not only traveled among the churches to teach God's kingdom, but he picked out Titus, Timothy, Philemon, and Onesimus, and he perfected them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can gather brothers and sisters in the countryside to Canton and Hong Kong and train them in the fifty-two lessons for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can do this in two trainings, with each training being two weeks in length.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After they are trained, they can be sent back to the countryside to work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The principle in God's work is to involve ourselves in the work first and then involve others in the same work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not take care of these two steps, we have failed and have come short of God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot say that we have done enough as long as we have worked hard ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul not only worked himself, but he stirred up others to join him in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In his Epistles to the Corinthians, we can see that he was pushing others to do the same work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to arrange some work for other brothers and sisters to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot be the only ones who are busy all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This approach is ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a hundred years everyone sitting here will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If no one is perfected to continue our work, what a loss this will be to God!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to use every means to make others work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to learn to take them by the hand in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to learn to deal with them and gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The way is to work, visit, and preach the gospel together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We admit that we are all inexperienced in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to be in fear and trembling, and we have to be very exercised before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one can be careless or loose in perfecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not think that we know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not think that we can be a teacher by simply reading textbooks.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There was no school for training prophets; all the prophets were raised up by God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can only say that we do not know that much.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are here learning, and we are hoping to bring men to God so that God can have a way in them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to be in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not order others to do this or that lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, we should take the lead to work together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is very presumptuous to think that only we can do something and that no one else can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The people that the Lord has given to us are more than what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every one of them is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not be presumptuous, loose, or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, we should not hesitate to make decisions for fear of making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have covered the matter of leadership before.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Leadership does not depend on ability.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, it depends on: 1 much prayer and diligent study of the Word, 2 the capacity to perfect others and raise them up, and 3 making everyone useful.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The way ahead lies on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are faithful to the Lord, He will get through in us, and the brothers and sisters will have a way to follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>HELPING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Can we help all the brothers and sisters rise up to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we can, we will not have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even if we have more people, we can still handle them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who can withstand the church when the entire Body rises up to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Five can chase a hundred, and a hundred can chase ten thousand Lev 26:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we can raise up all the one-talented ones, we can absorb as many people as are given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who are hard and stiff are hard inwardly; outwardly they can be very soft.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the reason it is not easy to perfect a person.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When a person volunteers to serve, he carries with him both his outward and inward attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Those who are gifted are usually hard and stiff.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We cannot open the door just to outward attributes while ignoring inward attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we do, we will make it hard for others to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It takes much work, labor, and prayer to perfect one person.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Brother Weigh's personal problems cannot be dealt with quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I would consider it very quick indeed if they are dealt with after five years.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It may take eight or ten years for some people.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Time is a big factor.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should not think that hearing something and understanding it is the end of the story.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have to ask the Lord for much mercy.</S>
