   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then God touched the hollow of his thigh, and he became lame Gen 32:22-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies that throughout Jacob s life he was struggling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Finally, in the matter of Joseph s being sold, Jacob was brought by God to a place where he no longer had any strength he had become lame.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the record in the Bible, there he did nothing but bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, he blessed Pharaoh, and later he blessed each of his own sons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Knowing the Desire of God s Heart</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In contrast to Isaac, Jacob did not bless blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, his sky was clear and he knew the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Joseph brought his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, to Jacob that he might bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He led his older son, Manasseh, toward Jacob s right hand and his younger son, Ephraim, toward Jacob s left hand, expecting that Jacob would place his right hand on Manasseh s head and his left hand on Ephraim s head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when Jacob stretched forth his hands to bless them, he crossed his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joseph was displeased and lifted up Jacob s hand to remove it from Ephraim s head and place it on Manasseh s head.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although Jacob s eyes were dim with age, his spirit was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He knew that God s desire was to place Ephraim above Manasseh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, he did not bless according to Joseph s arrangement but according to the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Blessings Becoming Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jacob s blessings became prophecies because his blessings were shining with light and fit in with God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, whatever blessings he gave to his sons became God s prophecies to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All that is recorded in the Bible from Exodus to Revelation constitutes the accomplishing and the fulfilling of the prophecies in Jacob s blessings.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In his old age, when Jacob heard that Joseph had been made governor of Egypt, his reactions were twofold: his heart was numb and his spirit revived Gen 45:26-27, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>. His soul-life had already become dead, and his spirit and soul could be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he arrived in Egypt, he did not demand anything; he only blessed others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, Jacob in his old age signifies the stage of maturity in the life of a complete, spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this respect he is unlike Abraham and Isaac, who signify only the initial stage of the experience and life of a spiritually mature person, and not the maturity of a spiritual person.</S>
