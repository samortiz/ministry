   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Christians may be greatly surprised to hear that a believer may be cast into unquenchable fire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may wonder how it could be possible for a saved one to be punished by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning this, we need to consider the word of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the One who said that if we are stumbled by a member of our body, we may be cast into unquenchable fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 9:41 the Lord speaks of reward, and in 9:42-48 He speaks concerning punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both the reward and the punishment will be in the coming age, in the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the coming age the one who gives a disciple a cup of cold water to drink because that one is Christ s, will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, the punishment spoken of in these verses will also be in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 9:43 the Lord speaks about entering into life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One aspect of the punishment in the coming age is losing the enjoyment of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have seen, here it is not a matter of receiving eternal life; instead, it is a matter of entering into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We received eternal life when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But entering into eternal life is a matter of the coming age, the age when the kingdom of God will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is still pending whether or not we shall enter into the enjoyment of eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be hindered by the lust of our hand, the lust of our foot, or the lust of our eye.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The lust in our members may cause us to lose the enjoyment of eternal life in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of entering into this enjoyment, we may be punished by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When some hear that believers may suffer in the coming age, they may say, This is serious!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How could redeemed ones suffer such a punishment?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isn t the redemption of Christ complete and adequate?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, Christ s redemption certainly is complete and adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, it is a fact that redeemed ones often receive some punishment by God in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to 1 Peter 1:7 and 4:12, and 17, the believers may be purged through trials as by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, 1 Peter 4:12 says, Beloved, do not think the fiery ordeal among you is strange, which is coming to you for a trial, as a strange thing happening to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word rendered fiery ordeal is purosei.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This word means burning and signifies the burning of a smelting furnace for the purification of gold and silver Prov 27:21; Psa 66:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter considered the persecution the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is God s way to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own house 1 Pet 4:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Bible teachers realize that it is possible that God s redeemed people may suffer God s punishment in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the redeemed ones may suffer God s punishment in this age, why should we think that it is not possible for them to suffer His punishment also in the coming age?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who has the ground to say that the believers cannot suffer the punishment of God in the coming age?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible does not tell us such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, the Bible reveals that God knows how to execute His punishment both in this age and in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, a father may consider what is the best way to discipline his child.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He may carry out the discipline immediately, or he may choose to wait for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will consider what is the best time to administer discipline to his child.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a similar way, God knows what is the best time for Him to discipline His children, and he also knows the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Testament indicates that genuine believers, those who have been fully redeemed by Christ, may still suffer God s discipline, God s chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact that God may discipline the believers does not mean that Christ s redemption is not complete or adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though Christ s redemption is fully complete and adequate, we still need to take Christ and be replaced by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We still need to pray and thereby be able to say in a practical way, No longer I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not take Christ in this way, we may be caused to stumble by the lust in our hand, foot, or eye.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then instead of enjoying eternal life in the coming kingdom age, we shall suffer God s punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE WAY TO ENTER INTO THE COMING KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether in the coming age we enjoy eternal life or suffer punishment depends on how we live today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to have a life of prayer and continually call on the name of the Lord, telling Him, Lord, it is no longer I, but You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, in every matter of my living may it be no longer I, but You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, I take You as my replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Replace me through Your death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, I realize that I have been terminated on the cross, and I also realize that in Your resurrection You are living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now I can say in my experience that it is no longer I who live, but You, Lord, are the One living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If this is your experience, then you will overcome the lust in your hand, foot, and eye.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will be a person taking Christ as your replacement, enjoying Him as everything in your daily living, and living Him in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, nothing will cause you to stumble, and neither will you cause others to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because you are filled and saturated with Christ, no part of your being will be able to cause you to stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead of being caused to stumble, you will be able to praise the Lord and say, Hallelujah, it is no longer I, but Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hallelujah for Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah for His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This enjoyment today will bring you into the enjoyment of eternal life in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is to enter into the coming kingdom and to be kept away from God s dispensational punishment in the kingdom age, a punishment that takes place temporarily for a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 9:49 the Lord says, For everyone shall be salted with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This indicates that fire will function as salt, and we shall be salted with this fire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This salt kills the germs of lust that are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although we have been saved and are children of God, we still have many germs within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we need the salt of fire, a fire-salt, to kill these germs and purify us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not merely a punishment; it is also a preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This fire-salt will preserve us from being corrupted eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we see what is revealed in these verses, we shall pray, Lord Jesus, may it be no longer I, but You in my daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In all things and in relation to all people, may it be not I, but You.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Lord, I need to be a praying person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through prayer I can overcome the lust that is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Lord, I have been crucified with You, and now You are living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through the cross we have been terminated, and in resurrection Christ has been brought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now we should enjoy Christ and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Day by day we should live a life in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then truly it will be, No longer I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we live such a life, we shall not cause others to stumble, and we shall not be caused to stumble by any lust that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then in this age we shall enjoy Christ and in the coming age we shall enter into a fuller enjoyment of eternal life, the enjoyment of the coming kingdom.</S>
