He knew that Kuei-yang lacked workers to preach the Lord's salvation, and He answered our prayer. He moved some of you and placed this thought into your hearts. I pray that the Lord would impart some spiritual gifts to you so that you might bring them to us. May the Lord use you to bear much good fruit to the glory of His name. When you leave Jun-Yi Station on your way here, send a telegram or ask the people in the Gospel Chapel to telephone us. Christian greetings to you. Greetings to Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and Brother Chang.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsu-kuang<br />March 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Lien-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Greetings to my dear X in the Lord!</p><p>We are together with you and all the brothers from all localities in Hankow in spirit, even though we are separated physically. Foochow has already been bombed three times, but the Lord has preserved and protected us. Our almighty Lord is certainly able to care for the brothers and sisters during this war. We are believers in the Lord, and our hope of glory is much closer under this kind of situation. The Lord is already at the door, hallelujah! We remember the brothers and sisters in difficulties in the Lord. We also remember the Lord's work. We are hereby respectfully forwarding X dollars. Please take the time to distribute it for us. Thank you. Please do not forget to pray for the work in the region of Lien-Jiang, Fukien. May the Lord revive His church and save sinners. Glory to the Lord's name, amen! Whenever it is convenient, please instruct us and send us the word which you put out there. I cannot write all that I want to say. When we meet face to face we can further our communication. May the Lord's grace overflow to you! Greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me! Revelation 22:20; 2 Peter 1:2, 11, 5-7.</p><p>Your weak sister in the Lord,<br />Chen Shu-ying<br />March 17, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>We remitted X dollars through the postal service today. X dollars are for The Open Door, and X dollars are for the brothers and sisters who are in difficulties. This money came from the offering box. Please use it according to the wishes of the offerers and distribute it for them. Thank you! The meetings here continue as usual. There is a message meeting on the Lord's Day morning at half past nine. The Lord's table meeting is at three o'clock in the afternoon. (We used to preach the gospel, but we have stopped for awhile.) There is a sisters' meeting at seven o'clock on Tuesdays. Thursday evening is still the prayer meeting. Most of the brothers and sisters who left Swatow have returned. Only a few are still living in the countryside. We went into the interior to work three times. Thank God, He was with us. We hope to go work there many times in the future. We are now waiting and praying for the Lord's leading. Please pray for this matter much. Brother Chen Wen-kuang sent a letter recently saying that since he returned to Fukien, his health has begun to improve and his voice has returned somewhat. We really thank and praise our Lord who hears our prayer!</p><p>Mrs. Liu has been very sad since the death of Brother Liang-wei because of their relationship. She is somewhat comforted because he was so peaceful when he died. The shipping business has been blessed by the Lord. Sister Lin Lee Tsuo-yu plans to go to Singapore. She is still living in Sister Chai Lan-jen's An Chuan Birth Clinic on Sin-Shing Street. Has The Christian been published recently? (We are preparing to print it&mdash;Editor.) If you publish anything, please send us some copies.</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fang-ching, Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> </body></html>
