   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A KING LIKE A REFUGE, A COVERING,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>STREAMS OF WATER, AND THE SHADOW</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF A MASSIVE ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is not only a crown and a stone, but also a King Isa 32:1-2; 33:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah reveals Him as a King for supplying us, caring for us, and covering us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ as the King is Jehovah, God, and He is also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our King is very human and even lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The presidents of the United States may try their best to lower themselves down to be among the people, but no one can compare with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is a King, yet He is very human and lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaiah 32:1 says, "Behold, a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not rule directly by Himself but indirectly through the rulers according to justice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to consider the difference between righteousness and justice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Righteousness is to be right, whereas justice is righteousness with a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without judgment, there is no possibility of justice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Justice comes from the judgment according to a person's righteousness, and it declares his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When judgment is exercised on someone according to what he is and has done, that verdict, that judgment, is justice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why justice is carried out by the rulers who judge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ will reign according to righteousness, and He will rule through His helpers, the rulers, to judge the people according to justice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The entire earth is lacking in righteousness, and nearly all the governments are short of justice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This One who reigns and rules through the rulers according to righteousness and justice is not only God but also a lowly man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Isaiah 32:1 this King is a man, and this Man-king is a refuge to us from the wind v. 2 . "Wind" always comes to us in the course of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The husbands have to admit that their wives are the source of much wind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wives "blow upon" their husbands much of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be a proper husband is not easy because the wind from the wife always comes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The husbands need to take Jesus as their refuge from the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever the wind blows, we need to run to this man, taking Him as our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we are protected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a man, He is also a covering from the tempest v. 2 . We have seen the difference between a crown and a diadem and between righteousness and justice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we need to see the difference between the wind and the tempest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of how strong the wind is, in itself it is not a tempest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A tempest is a turmoil, a tumult.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is much stronger and more troublesome than just wind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A tempest is much harder to face than wind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The man Jesus is not only a refuge from the wind but also a covering from the tempest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because He is our covering, the tempest, the turmoil, cannot bother us or damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should learn to experience the Lord in these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Especially in the past three years, the tempest came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I took the Lord as a covering from this tempest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This man is also streams of water in a dry place v. 2 . These streams of water are our supply, comfort, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today whose situation is not a dry place?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whose marriage is not a dry place?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Married life always dries people up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some husbands are so capable in drying up their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some wives are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our businesses and jobs are also very dry places.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these dry places, we need to take a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of taking a cup of coffee, we should "take a cup of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we will be watered in a dry place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not merely a small amount of water, but He is streams of water.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We Christians should be able to testify of this.</S>
