[1]  CONTENTS A Practical Definition of the Flesh The Practicality of Turning to Christ in
[2]  Our Spirit Three Major Aspects of Christ in Romans
[3]  CHAPTER ONE A PRACTICAL DEFINITION OF THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Rom 6:6; 7:17-20, 24, 25; 8:3, 6-10; 3:20
[4]  Have you ever realized that your flesh is a polluted thing?
[5]  Regardless of how good a person you may be, you still have the flesh.
[6]  You may be the best person, but your flesh is not better than anyone else's. Do not say that you have a better flesh than someone else.
[7]  Paul said, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells" v. 18 . In my flesh no good thing dwells, because the flesh is fully possessed, taken over, by Satan as sin.
[8]  BEING FORCED BY THE FLESH TO TURN TO THE SPIRIT
[9]  Now I would like us to see that this flesh eventually is good for us.
[10]  It seems that the more we pray to deal with the flesh, the more we are bothered by the flesh and the more active our flesh is.
[11]  Eventually, the Lord showed me that He left the flesh with us for our good because it helps us and forces us to turn to Him, to turn to the spirit.
[12]  Even if you have been saved for a long time and have been with the Lord in a deeper way, these two things are absolutely with you.
[13]  The Christian life seems to be very mysterious and abstract, but Paul made it practical by speaking about the flesh on the negative side and the spirit on the positive side.
[14]  The human flesh and the human spirit are the keys to the practical Christian life.
[15]  If we are going to experience life in a practical way, we must be clear about the flesh and the spirit.
[16]  We may have read Romans 6 8 and may be familiar with the flesh and the spirit as terms, but what we need is a heavenly vision, a divine revelation.
[17]  THE FLESH FORCING US TO TURN TO THE SPIRIT
[18]  Now that we have been saved, we might tell the Lord, "Lord, thank You that You have saved me.
[19]  Now let us consider the importance of our spirit.
[20]  Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.
[21]  Eventually, in Romans we see that the tree of knowledge got into man's flesh, and the tree of life got into man's spirit.
[22]  This is why Paul comes to the conclusion that we need to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .
[23]  To walk is to have our being and our living with all that we say and do.
[24]  IN ROMANS EIGHT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:3, 9-10, 34; John 1:14; 14:16-17; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Heb 2:14; Eph 2:15, 22 CHRIST CONDEMNING SIN IN THE FLESH
[25]  Romans 8:3 says, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
[26]  We need to realize that all of us are little serpents.
[27]  We have to realize that while we are still on this earth, we need the help of the flesh to force us to turn to Christ in our spirit.
[28]  Christ died on the cross to deal with the flesh and condemn sin.
[29]  Whether we are happy or unhappy, the flesh helps us to turn to Christ in the spirit and have no more confidence in the flesh.
[30]  He became the flesh to crush the flesh and to condemn sin in the flesh, and He became the Spirit to indwell us and become our life.
[31]  We can use electricity as an illustration of this.
[32]  The power plant is far away from the electrical lights in a building, yet these lights are one with the power plant when they are turned on.
[33]  There is nothing good in our flesh, yet it is still here to help us turn to Christ in our spirit.
[34]  CHAPTER FOUR A STRONG SPIRIT FOR GOD'S HABITATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4, 9-10; Gal 5:25; Eph 2:22; 1 Cor 5:3; Rev 1:10, 12; John 4:24; Deut 12:5-7, 13-14 GOD RESERVING THE HUMAN SPIRIT FOR HIS PURPOSE
[35]  The flesh and the spirit are the real keys to our spiritual life and church life.
[36]  If we mean business with the Lord for the Christian life and the church life, we have to see the flesh and the spirit.
[37]  We need to realize that our flesh has been thoroughly polluted and corrupted by Satan's presence.
[38]  If we consider our past before we were saved, we can realize that although our flesh was so bad, deep within us there was another part preserved by God.
[39]  We must also see that Christ as the Son of God, even as God Himself, has taken two steps.
[40]  But God allowed the flesh to remain with us to help us and force us to turn to Christ in our spirit.
[41]  We have to realize that our flesh has been crushed, and our spirit has been not only regenerated but also strengthened.
[42]  We have such a wonderful, strengthened, mingled spirit within us, and this spirit must be the strongest part of our whole being.
[43]  Certain ones have come to us to argue against the truth concerning the ground of the church or concerning the Lord's recovery.
[44]  Sometimes I would say, "In your mind you are arguing with me, but in your spirit you say Amen to me."
[45]  If we do not worship God corporately in our spirit, we will be divided by our opinions and concepts.
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE EATING JESUS FOR GROWTH AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8; Rom 10:12; Col 2:9; John 1:14, 16; 1 Cor 3:2a, 7; Col 2:19; Eph 4:13 CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT
[47]  God's eternal plan is to get a living building, but Satan came into man, into man's flesh, trying to frustrate God.
[48]  I loved the Lord and the Bible so much, but for many years I never heard a message telling me that I have to grow in life.
[49]  First Corinthians 11 tells us that in the night in which the Lord was betrayed, He took bread and said, "This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me" v. 24 . Then He took the cup and said, "This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" v. 25 . Why does the Lord tell us to remember Him in this way? One day the Lord opened my eyes to see what the real remembrance of Him is.
[50]  In Luke 15 the Lord told the parable of a prodigal son returning home to his father.
[51]  He decided to tell his father, "I have sinned against heaven and before you.
[52]  Then in the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the Lord Jesus promised the overcomers in the churches that He would give them to eat of the tree of life 2:7 and the hidden manna v. 17 . Even He said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" Rev 3:20 . Some use this to preach the gospel by saying that Jesus is standing at the door of your heart and if you receive Him, He will come into you.
[53]  Our functioning in the meetings is the issue of our eating Christ.
