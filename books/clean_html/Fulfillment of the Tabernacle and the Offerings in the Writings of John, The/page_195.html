<p>Some believe that even in the New Testament some trace of the distinction between oikos and oikia still exists. They would say, and in this way they may be correct, that oikos in 2:16 has a somewhat broader meaning than oikia in 14:2. As used in 14:2, oikia may have a more narrow, purified sense than oikos.<p>We should remember that before the Lord spoke about the Father’s house, Judas, the false one, had left. This indicates that the house in 14:2 is something pure, for it is related to the divine glorification. Therefore, the house, the church, is pure and does not include any false disciples. It is purely the multiplication of the Lord Jesus Himself. Certainly the many grains of wheat produced by the unique grain do not include any tares. Judas was a tare, and this tare was eliminated before the Lord spoke the message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. Hence, the Lord was multiplied in a pure way to become many grains, and among these grains there are no tares. Now all these grains are being blended together to become one loaf, and this loaf is Christ’s Body. In the Body of Christ, there cannot be any foreign elements. If Judas had remained, he would have been a foreign element in this organic Body. But such a mixture could not be permitted. The Father’s house is pure, and the grains produced by Christ as the unique grain constitute a pure multiplication of Him.<p>The important point we are making here regarding oikos and oikia is that by the time the New Testament was written these words were used as synonyms. Actually, it is very difficult to find any distinction between them. Therefore, those who insist in holding to the concept that the Father’s house in 14:2 denotes a heavenly mansion cannot rightly claim that the fact that different Greek words are used for house in 2:16 and 14:2 proves that oikia in 14:2 refers to some kind of dwelling place in the heavens, whereas oikos in chapter two refers to God’s house, the temple. No, both oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2 refer to the dwelling place of God on earth.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION, FRUIT-BEARING, AND THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>We have seen that as the multiplication of Christ, we are His glorification. According to John 15:8, the Father is glorified when the branches of the vine bear fruit: “In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.” Why is it that God the Father is glorified when we bear much fruit? The reason the Father is glorified through our bearing of fruit is that in fruit-bearing there is the manifestation of God as life from within us, and this manifestation is the Father’s glorification.<p>The divine glorification is also related to the birth of the new man in chapter sixteen. The bringing forth of this new man covers a long span of time. This delivery, which is in resurrection, is the multiplication and glorification of the Lord Jesus. The full definition of this glorification is covered in the five and a half chapters from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen.<p>After the Lord prayed in chapter seventeen, He presented Himself to be arrested, judged, sentenced, and crucified. According to the Gospel of John, the Lord’s death was His going away, and His resurrection was His coming to the disciples. Through His going and His coming, He produced the many grains of wheat, and these grains are His glorification. In this glorification the Body is produced. This Body is the Father’s house, the Father’s house is the vine, and the vine is the new man to express God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.<p>After the Lord was resurrected, He appeared to the disciples and breathed on them (20:22). In this way the disciples received Him as the pneuma. As the pneuma the Lord entered into the disciples and remained with them. According to chapter twenty-one, the Lord was even with some of the disciples when they were fishing.<p>In the Gospel of John there is no record of Christ’s ascension. But Acts, which is written from another angle, speaks clearly of the Lord’s ascension. In John’s Gospel we see that the resurrected Christ remains within us essentially to be our life so that we may live by Him to bear fruit. Through this fruit-bearing we continue the Lord’s multiplication and glorification. This is the continuation of the glorification of Christ in the church life.
