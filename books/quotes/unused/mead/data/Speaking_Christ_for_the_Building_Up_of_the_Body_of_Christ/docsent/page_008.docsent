   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING A VICTORIOUS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we need to live a victorious life to overcome sin, to overcome the world, to overcome ourselves, to overcome our flesh, and even to overcome our quarreling with our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wives and the husbands among us may not be so one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many couples may not have prayed together for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the situation that really needs a revival that we may live a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In each of the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the closing word is that we have to overcome 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>ABIDING IN THE FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>DAILY AND HOURLY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also must abide in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly 1 John 1:6; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the angels should be able to testify that we are in the fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be away from Him but present in His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There should be no absence in our fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Daily and even hourly we need to be such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I were not such a person, it would be hard for me to speak in the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My speaking depends upon my continual and present fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why can we not speak in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Maybe we have been absent from the Lord s fellowship for three days because we had a quarrel with our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of this quarrel, we have been put away from the Lord s fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are going to speak for the Lord, we have to recover our fellowship with Him by confessing our sin and by making an apology to our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must remain, abide, in the constant and continual fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a strong demand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING A PRAYING PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must also be praying persons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should pray unceasingly all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we have to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to call, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not think that such a short calling means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It means a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we are working in an office, teaching a class, or doing any task, we can call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a short calling means a lot to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By calling on the name of the Lord, we can pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For us to be the speaking ones in our meetings we must be praying persons.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to God s principle in His creation, He ordained to have a new year, a new month or a new moon, and a new day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within every year we can have three hundred sixty-five new starts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we failed for three hundred sixty-four days, we still have one more opportunity to have a successful day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may have failed today, but thank the Lord tomorrow is still here waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Tomorrow morning we will have another chance to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within every twenty-four hours, there is a new chance for us to have a new start and be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To have a new start is not hard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just rise up a little earlier and say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You do not need to shout loudly to bother others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To say this makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes I forgot to call on the Lord immediately after I woke up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That became a big loss to me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as I realized this I said, Lord Jesus, forgive me for forgetting You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we need to pray-read a short portion of the Word, anywhere from two to four verses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can enjoy the Lord with His Word and in His Word through pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should do this every day in the morning to have a good, new start.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can speak the Word to ourselves, to the Lord, and even to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can speak the Word to our pets and even to our furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we speak the Word in such a way, we will be the first ones nourished by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not need to spend a long time to enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Ten to fifteen minutes is sufficient to get nourished and have a good start of a new day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to practice this.</S>
