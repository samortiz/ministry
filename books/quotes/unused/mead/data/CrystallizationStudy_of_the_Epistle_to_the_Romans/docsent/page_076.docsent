   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Grace of the Lord Which Superabounded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with Faith and Love in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If there were no grace of God, none of us could have faith and love in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a wonder that we can believe in Jesus and love Him whom we have never seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we were threatened and persecuted unto martyrdom, we still could not deny that we believe in Jesus and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a result of superabounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not a small thing for a sinner to believe in Christ and to continue in loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many clever and wise people have been convinced, subdued, and eventually caught by the Lord s superabounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day when John Nelson Darby was over eighty years old, he stayed overnight in a hotel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before going to sleep, he said, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This story nearly brought me to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is marvelous that an old man, staying in a hotel, would say, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To love Jesus is a wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To love Jesus is a miracle of the superabounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s grace superabounded with faith and love in Christ to the apostle Paul for his dynamic and excellent salvation that he might be one of the greatest apostles 1 Tim 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Paul s history in the New Testament, he was Saul of Tarsus, a strong and very knowledgeable person opposing Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day he changed from opposing to believing and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was because the grace of the Lord was superabounding to him to make him an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three T books 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus are on the apostleship, and an apostle is produced by the superabounding grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>51.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Grace with Timothy That Enabled Him</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>to Guard the Deposit and Turn Away</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>from Profane, Vain Babblings and Antitheses</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of What Was Falsely Called Knowledge,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not Misaiming concerning the Faith</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Timothy 6:20 and 21 speak of the grace with Timothy that enabled him to guard the deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Timothy had received the deposit of God s grace, mainly through Paul and his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Something had been deposited into Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now Timothy needed to guard it by the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this grace he was also enabled to turn away from profane and vain babblings and antitheses of what was falsely called knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words antithesis and knowledge were used by Paul to describe the Gnostic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Gnostics thought they were men of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They tried to convince people by antithesis, that is, by contrasting and comparing two things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At Paul s time the Gnostic teachings in the way of antitheses were prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They called that their knowledge, but Paul said it was falsely called knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This took away some believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why Paul charged Timothy to turn away from this knowledge of the Gnostics antitheses, not misaiming concerning the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>52.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Grace according to Which God Had</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Saved the Apostles and Called Them with a Holy</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Calling and Which Was Given to Them in</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ Jesus before the Times of the Ages</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Timothy 1:9 says that grace was given to the apostles before the times of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 1 says that we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world v. 4 . Before the times of the ages, God chose and predestinated us, so we received grace then.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>53.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Grace Which Is in Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>and in Which Timothy, One of the Younger</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Co-workers of the Apostle Paul, Was Empowered</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>in the Degradation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 2 Timothy 2:1 Paul told Timothy, You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While the church was degrading, Timothy was empowered to stand against that degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He could do this by the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
