[2]  This volume, Questions on the Gospel, was published by Watchman Nee around 1934.
[3]  3 Grace is not a withholding from him who does not deserve it.
[4]  This is similar to the first point except that the question is turned around.
[5]  Rather, grace is given because man does not deserve it.
[6]  When God sees man as helpless and having no way out, He will dispense grace.
[7]  If man is capable, he will not realize he needs grace, and God will not need to bestow grace.
[8]  7, 9; "cleanses us from every sin" and "cleanse us from all unrighteousness" means all ; 3 before he confesses his sins, God is willing to forgive him because the Lord Jesus is his Advocate before God 2:1-2 ; and 4 God forgives and cleanses him because, on the one hand, God is faithful and righteous and, on the other hand, the Lord Jesus is the Righteous One.
[9]  According to the Bible, what is the difference between "transgression" and "iniquity"?
[10]  Whenever man commits a sin, offends God, and disobeys God, he has iniquity before God.
[11]  Is there any difference between "blessed" in Romans 4:7 and "blessed" in verse 8?
[12]  Verse 7 says that God forgives man's iniquities and covers his sins, while verse 8 says that God works to such an extent that a man can be regarded as though he had never sinned: "by no means account sin."
[13]  Is the purification of our sins carried out only once or many times?
[14]  Hebrews 10:10 through 12 says, "By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all...But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God."
[15]  If we do not realize the great effectiveness of the blood of the Lord Jesus before God, we will consider the blood of the Lord and the blood of bulls and goats to be the same.
[16]  In Leviticus 4:1-7, why was the blood of the sin offering brought to the tabernacle of the congregation and sprinkled seven times before the veil of the sanctuary before God; according to the law of the cleansing of the lepers in Leviticus 14:1-7, the blood was sprinkled upon the lepers seven times?
[17]  How are the words sin and sins used differently in the Bible?
[18]  After reading the many Scripture verses above, we will see how wise God was in the writing of the Bible, and we will truly say to Him, "O God!
[19]  How then are we to be freed from the dominating sin the singular sin ?
[20]  "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves" Rom 6:6 .
[21]  Three things are mentioned here: 1 the body of sin; 2 the old man; and 3 sin.
[22]  Are we saved by God's grace or by God's righteousness?
[23]  What part of salvation is accomplished by God's grace, and what part is by God's righteousness?
[24]  God's grace provides a Savior for us, so that we have the possibility of being saved John 3:16 , while God's righteousness causes salvation to be accomplished upon us, so that God must save us.
[25]  Are we saved by the righteousness of God Rom 3:21-26 or by the righteousness of Christ?
[26]  Romans 3:25 and 26 say, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."
[27]  "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[28]  Christ becoming righteousness means that God gives Christ to us, making Him our righteousness.
[29]  In this way, God accepts us as He accepts Christ, and God considers us perfect even as Christ is perfect.
[30]  What aspect of God is revealed by the persecution of the Lord Jesus?
[31]  The Lord Jesus' persecution expresses the love of God, and His being put to death expresses the righteousness of God.
[32]  Why, in God's plan of redemption, must Christ be both God and man at the same time?
[33]  Suppose there are three persons: A, B, and C. Person C has sinned, and A asks B to die for C. This would show that A has love toward C, and that C has answered the requirements of the law; however, this is rather unjust to B. I sinned, and God caused Christ to die for me.
[34]  Why does Romans 5:18 say, "One offense...one righteous act," yet verse 19 says, "The disobedience of one man...the obedience of the One"?
[35]  Does our salvation have a direct relationship to His keeping of the law?
[36]  How do we "establish the law" through faith Rom 3:31 ?
[37]  One picture is that through the body of Christ, we are dead to the law and have completely broken away from it.
[38]  Now we belong to the Christ who has resurrected from the dead, and we can bear fruit to God.
[39]  If someone says, "We should keep the law; we should keep the Sabbath," we should realize that if we attempt to keep one commandment of the law, we are saying that Christ did not die for us.
[40]  How did Christ fulfill the law and the prophets Matt 5:17 ?
[41]  Matthew 5:18 says, "For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass."
[42]  "One iota" refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and "one serif" refers to the diacritical marks in the Hebrew alphabet.
[43]  After the Holy Spirit descended and the church was established, Peter still kept the ceremonial laws by refraining from eating unclean things as mentioned in Leviticus 11.
[44]  "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common" Acts 10:9-16 .
[45]  Can Galatians 3:21 be read as follows: "Is then the law against the promises of God?
[46]  If we say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood as a price to pay the devil to redeem us, we are, similarly, saying that God acknowledges the legality of man falling into the devil's hand.
[47]  Does Romans 2:12 say that a man will not perish if he does not have the law which means God has not given him the law and commits sin?
[48]  Will a sinner still end up in perdition if he has never heard the gospel?
[49]  We are saved not because God is obligated to save us, but because God extends special grace to us.
[50]  However, if the Lord Jesus had not died for us, God would not have been unrighteous if He did not save us.
[51]  Since the basis of salvation is the death of Christ, why does the Bible tell us to believe not only in His death but also in His resurrection?
[52]  On the cross Christ said, "It is finished," indicating that the work of the cross was complete.
[53]  Why then could we still not be saved if He had not resurrected?
[54]  QUESTION TWENTY-TWO CONCERNING 1 CORINTHIANS 15:3 AND 17
[55]  First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins.
[56]  Why does verse 17 say that if Christ has not been raised, we are yet in our sins?
[57]  Why does the Bible tell us to believe in the Son of God?
[58]  Which one of Christ's accomplished works for us corresponds to believing in the Son of God?
[59]  Adam was created by God not born of God; Christ was born of God not created by God.
[60]  What does it mean to be justified by the blood?
[61]  Our justification by resurrection is the positive side of the matter.
[62]  He resurrected to impart a new life to us.
[63]  Christ's resurrection not only imparts a new life to us; it also hides our life with Christ in God Col 3:3 .
[64]  On the objective side, we appear before God in Christ and have a new position so that God sees us just as He sees Christ.
[65]  There are two aspects to the crucifixion of Christ: being crucified by man and being crucified by God.
[66]  Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God.
[67]  Which part of Christ's crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God?
[68]  When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him.
[69]  From the seven sentences spoken by the Lord on the cross, we can understand which part of the crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God.
[70]  What is the difference between Christ dying for us Rom 5:8 and Christ dying for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 ?
[71]  The meaning of Christ dying for us is that Christ died for us as sinners.
[72]  In God's redemption, do Christians exchange their position with Christ?
[73]  In other words, did the righteous Christ become unrighteous and are unrighteous sinners made righteous 2 Cor 5:21 ?
[74]  "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him" 2 Cor 5:21 .
[75]  Although we often say that we were sinful and that we were saved only because Christ died instead of us, we need to know that this expression refers exclusively to what we personally attained.
[76]  On one hand, God has laid our sins on the Lord, and therefore, the Lord bore our sins; but on the other hand, in God's way of redemption, God judged both us and sin when He judged the Lord Jesus.
[77]  No. Do we become righteousness in Him? No. Instead of these, we "become the righteousness of God in Him." We should not only pay attention to the words "in Him" but also to the words "the righteousness of God." Christ was not made sin on our behalf in order to make us righteous and no longer sinners.
[78]  When were we united with Christ on the objective side, and when were we united with Him on the subjective side?
[79]  We were united with Christ objectively at the time Christ died on the cross: "One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .
[80]  Why does the Bible say that we are "in the Lord," "in Christ," and "in Christ Jesus," but never "in Jesus" or "in Jesus Christ"?
[81]  Although 1 Thessalonians 4:14 says in Chinese, "So also those who have fallen asleep in Jesus," it should be translated according to the Greek as follows: "So also those who have fallen asleep through Jesus."
[82]  There is no place in the Bible where we can find a phrase such as in Jesus or in Jesus Christ.
[83]  Jesus Christ means that the lowly Jesus is the One who is the Christ, while Christ Jesus means that the One who is now Christ is the One who was Jesus.
[84]  QUESTION THIRTY-FOUR CONCERNING THE BLOOD AND THE CROSS
[85]  What is the difference between the significance and function of the blood and the significance and function of the cross?
[86]  Because some may ask, "Since sins have been taken away before God, why is sin still with us?", we ought to pay attention to this question in order to eliminate any doubt.
[87]  Does the Bible ever say that our justification is because of the cross?
[88]  The blood is before Him; it enables God to justify us.
[89]  It is the righteousness that makes us fit to dwell in heaven with God.
[90]  The blood of the Lord Jesus enables us to have a standing in heaven so that we may dwell with God.
[91]  The Bible says that the Lord Jesus died for everyone.
[92]  Will a person perish if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus?
[93]  "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .
[94]  Since the Lord Jesus' death is a death for all, it might seem that a person will not have to die even if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus.
[95]  How can we reconcile John 1:12-13, which says that receiving life is not of the "will of man," and Revelation 22:17, which says that whosoever will can take life?
[96]  Does Luke 10:25-37 indicate that a person inherits eternal life because he loves the Lord his God with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his strength, with all his mind, and by loving his neighbor as himself?
[97]  If so, is not inheriting eternal life dependent upon works?
[98]  When we believe, we have eternal life; when we believe, we are saved; and when we believe, we are justified, etc. In Luke 10 a certain lawyer asked, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" The Lord said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?" The lawyer replied, "You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself." Then the Lord said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall have life." The law teaches two things: to love God and to love man.
[99]  In the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, was the rich man's perdition a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime?
[100]  Was Lazarus' salvation a result of suffering evil things in his lifetime, or were there other reasons?
[101]  QUESTION THIRTY-NINE CONCERNING ROMANS 4 AND JAMES 2
[102]  Romans 4 says that Abraham was justified by faith, and James 2 says that Abraham was justified by works.
[103]  How do we explain these two kinds of justification?
[104]  Verse 14 says, "What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works?
[105]  Verse 21 says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?"
[106]  If James had not referred to this instance of Abraham, some might have considered that he was wrong, after reading the books of Romans and Galatians.
[107]  Since Paul spoke of justification by faith, they might have assumed that just believing is enough and there is no need for any works.
[108]  What is the relationship between the death of the Lord Jesus and the descending of the Holy Spirit?
[109]  Let us consider 2 Corinthians 5:18-20: "But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.
[110]  On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God."
[111]  What are the requirements for salvation, that is, for receiving eternal life?
[112]  Some people think that in order to be saved we must believe and then implore God earnestly, hoping that God will pity us and have mercy on us so that we might go to heaven.
[113]  But the Bible does not say that we should hope for God's graciousness towards us; rather, it says that we must believe that God has already granted us grace.
[114]  Romans 3:21 and 22 say, "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets; even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction."
[115]  Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes v. 4 . Faith is the requirement for obtaining righteousness, but what is this faith? The previous verses say that the word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart, and that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
[116]  Some people think, "I am a sinner and need to have good behavior.
[117]  Although God saves us unto good works, that is, we have been "created in Christ Jesus for good works" Eph 2:10 and "prepared unto every good work" 2 Tim 2:21 , nevertheless, we must remember that the Bible tells us that good works come after being saved.
[118]  Some have said that our sins are like strips of paper hanging one by one on the cross.
[119]  When we confess one sin, one strip is taken off the cross, while the sins which we have not confessed are still hanging there.
[120]  However, some may reply, "Since 1 John 1:9 says, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,' does this not indicate that we must confess our sins?"
[121]  He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.
[122]  Can someone who commits such a sin be saved?
[123]  What does it mean to fall from grace Gal 5:4 ?
[124]  Can the ones who have fallen from grace be saved?
[125]  However, a danger developed among them; some said that even though the beginning of man's salvation is by faith in Christ, by the moving of the Holy Spirit, and by the grace of God, once he is saved, he can only please God by keeping His law and trying his best to do good.
[126]  Will the people mentioned in Hebrews 6:4-8 perish?
[127]  Hebrews 6:1 through 8 says, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment.
[128]  For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame.
[129]  The word "once" in verse 4 denotes a historical fact.
[130]  The word "again" in "renew themselves again unto repentance" v. 6 is the same Greek word used in "not laying again a foundation" v. 1 . In Greek, the word "leaving" in verse 1 has the meaning of "slipping" or "falling away." The coordinate conjunction "and" in verses 4 and 5 joins four items together, namely, "once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come." If one has experienced these four items, it is impossible for him to renew his repentance again just because he has fallen once.
[131]  It is impossible for him to crucify the Son of God again and put Him to open shame, even if he wishes to do so.
[132]  Hebrews 10:26 says, "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[133]  It is true that God sent His Son to die for me, to bear my sins so that I would be saved through believing in His Son.
[134]  Even though he has heard God's Word which says that the blood of Jesus was shed for the remission of sins, and that this blood is precious as the blood of the Lamb without blemish, he says that Jesus died as a martyr and that His blood is as common as anyone else's. Even though he has heard God's Word which says that the Holy Spirit brings man to repentance and gives eternal life, he says, "I do not believe God will impart the accomplished work of Jesus Christ to me; I do not believe that man can be born again." For this kind of people, the Bible declares, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[135]  Hebrews 7:27 says, "Who does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself."
[136]  Hebrews 9:12 says, "And not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption."
[137]  Hebrews 9:25 through 28 says, "Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures; since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world.
[138]  But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself....So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many."
[139]  Therefore, Hebrews 10 tells us that if there are some who have heard the truth and sin willfully, rejecting the blood of the Son of God, rejecting the Holy Spirit, and despising the Son of God, for them "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[140]  How many kinds of forgiveness from God are there according to the Bible?
[141]  John 20:23 says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained."
[142]  This concerns God's way of dealing with His children.
[143]  Concerning the forgiveness of the kingdom, Matthew 18:21 through 35 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[144]  If judgment is to begin from the house of God 1 Pet 4:17 , this judgment must be most severe.
[145]  How we hope that God will have mercy upon us before the judgment seat, for even there, there is grace.
[146]  While it is true that God is absolutely righteous in His judgment, He is also forgiving.
[147]  The word "judgment" in this verse indicates that God will judge us in the same way that we judge others; this means that we will be judged by God on that day in the same manner that we judge our brothers today.
[148]  How many kinds of salvation are mentioned in the Bible?
[149]  We are saved because God loved us, not because we loved God 1 John 4:10 .
[150]  Our love may easily change, but God's love is deeper than the love of a mother Isa 49:15 ; it is eternal Jer 31:3 , to the uttermost John 13:1 , and unchanging.
[151]  This everlasting love of God assures us that His salvation can never be a matter of concern and never be lost.
[152]  We are not saved by ourselves nor by our works but by the grace of God Eph 2:8-9 .
[153]  Furthermore, God has saved us according to His grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages 2 Tim 1:9 .
[154]  "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved" Mark 16:16 .
[155]  The salvation spoken of in this verse does not refer to eternal salvation, because the verse continues to say, "But he who does not believe shall be condemned."
[156]  Since the first part says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," we may wonder why the second part does not say, "He who does not believe and is not baptized shall be condemned."
[157]  Since our whole being is composed of three parts spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:23 , our salvation involves the salvation of these three parts.
[158]  When God forgave all our sins, the Holy Spirit entered into us and enlivened our deadened spirit.
[159]  Hebrews tells us that although our bodies are unclean, the blood of the Son of God has cleansed us and that by His blood we are able to enter into the Holy of Holies and have fellowship with God.
[160]  They ate and drank their own food before they partook of the Lord's supper, so that while they were overly filled or even drunk, others came in hungry 1 Cor 11:20-22 .
[161]  Yet Paul acknowledged that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus and were "called saints."
