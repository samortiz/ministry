<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ISSUE OF THE UNION<br>OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND<br>THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-6</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers is the building up of the Body of Christ.</li><li>The building up of the Body of Christ is not of human work, nor is it the forming together of a group of people by man's natural way; hence, it has absolutely nothing to do with man's work, effort, ways, ideas, moral teachings, philosophy, or any religious system or activities.</li><li>The building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution, in the aforementioned two spirits, of the processed and consummated Triune God with a group of tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image.</li><li>This constitution is constituted with:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers who are redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed by God as its outward framework.</li>	<li>The processed and consummated Triune God as its inward element:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The Father of the Triune God is the source of the inward element.</li>		<li>The Son of the Triune God is the inward element itself.</li>		<li>The Spirit of the Triune God is the essence of the inward element&#151;Eph. 4:4-6.</li>		<li>All three are dispensed, transfused, and built into God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers.</li>		<li>That they and the redeeming and transforming God may be constituted into one entity as the organic Body of Christ, being God yet man and man yet God&#151;Eph. 4:3-4a.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Such a constitution of divinity with humanity is uniquely one in the universe; it should not and cannot be divided.</li>	</ol></li><li>This constitution is the union and mingling of God and man: divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place and humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place.</li><li>This is the harvest of the Triune God's selection in eternity and of the works of His old creation, redemption, and new creation in time.</li><li>In such a great achievement, the operating Triune God is the Benefactor, and the tripartite men who respond to His operation are the beneficiaries; both are also the satisfied enjoyers.</li><li>This is God's eternal heart's desire and His ultimate purpose; this is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for.</li><li>This is the Triune God's anticipated multiplication and His expected increase.</li><li>This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who are graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity.</li></ol>
