   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BLESSING ON THE GROUND OF UNITY Scripture reading: 1 Corinthians 1:10-13; 11:19; Titus 3:10; Psalm 133:1-3; Ephesians 4:3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Psalm 133, there are four main items: the unity, the ointment, the dew, and the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Unity causes us to enjoy the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are not in unity, of course, we miss the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unity among the brethren is the very factor that brings in the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Between unity and life in this Psalm are the ointment and the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that ointment in typology is the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Godhead in God's divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But what does the dew signify?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Freshness is something of the dew, but it is not the dew itself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will see later what the dew is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TWO ASPECTS OF UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is quite interesting that only two aspects of the unity are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One aspect is likened to the ointment upon a body, and the other is likened to the dew which falls upon a place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church life, there are also these two aspects: the Body aspect and the place aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is the Body of Christ, who is the greater Aaron, and the church is also the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ointment upon the Head runs down upon the Body of Christ, and the dew from Mount Hermon falls upon Zion, which is the very place of God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So there is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the Body of Christ is the ointment, and with God's dwelling place is the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For both the ointment on the Body and the dew on the dwelling place of God, we need the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without the unity, there is little ointment and little dew.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To partake of the ointment and the dew, we must have the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are in unity, the ointment flows on the Body, and the dew falls from heaven upon the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever realized that in this Psalm there are these two aspects of the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Lord's Body we need the ointment of the Holy Spirit flowing all the time, and as God's dwelling place we need the dew falling upon us from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those of us who have been meeting in Los Angeles have really tasted something of this ointment and dew in our practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we come together, and even in our homes, we have a deep inner sense that the ointment is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the gracious moving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, accompanying the flow of the Spirit, is a kind of watering just as dew, so strengthening and so refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church life, there is the sweet and gracious flow of the Spirit, and at the same time, there is the watering and refreshing dew.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE DEW OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are really poor, we need mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we are in unity, we have something more than mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the dew, the sufficient grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen" 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the moving of the ointment, and the grace of the Lord Jesus is the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we meet together, fellowship with each other, and love one another, there is spontaneously within us a sweet flow of the Spirit, so gracious, so good, and so pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the same time we sense the strengthening within, the watering, the refreshing, the comforting and empowering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in the unity, and we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the Body, we need the ointment, and as the dwelling place, we need the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without the grace, we are very dry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But with the grace, we are watered and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the local church we are being watered day by day with grace, just as the fresh dew every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To my sense, there are no evenings in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even the evening meetings are still in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we are at the Lord's Table in the evening, I always sense that it is morning, because the dew is there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not have night, but morning with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what accompanies the unity of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The ointment and the dew are the result of the commanded blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord not only gives us the blessing, but He commands the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seems that the Lord on the throne orders the blessing upon those who are on the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am not speaking what I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am telling you what I have experienced for the past forty years!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You cannot imagine how much I have enjoyed the ointment and the dew in these past years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And I am still enjoying it!</S>
