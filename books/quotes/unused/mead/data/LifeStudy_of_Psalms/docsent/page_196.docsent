   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PSALMIST'S ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS HIS HIGH RETREAT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The subject of Psalm 62 is the psalmist's enjoyment of God as his high retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. The Psalmist's Enjoyment of God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 1 through 7 speak of the psalmist's enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 2 he says, "He alone is my rock and my salvation,/My high retreat; I will not be greatly shaken."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He repeats this word in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is good, but it cannot compare with the teaching in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. The Psalmist's Advice to the People</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 8 through 12 we have the psalmist's advice to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 8 he says, "Trust in Him at all times, O people;/Pour out your heart before Him;/God is a refuge to us."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He goes on to say that men of low degree are but a vapor and men of high degree, a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he gives this advice: "Do not trust in oppression,/And do not become vain through robbery;/If wealth increases,/Do not set your heart on it" v. 10 . This advice regarding wealth is good, but it is not as good as Paul's word in 1 Timothy 6.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The psalmist concludes by saying, "Once has God spoken;/Twice have I heard this, /That strength belongs to God./To You also, O Lord, belongs lovingkindness;/For You repay every man according to his work" 62:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word may seem somewhat good, but its spiritual level is very low compared to that of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The psalms we have covered in this message may function as a background to help us understand the real spiritual things revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These psalms concern humanity in the ethical field, and thus they are lacking in spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nowhere in the Psalms do we have a word about living and walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in Romans 8:4 Paul speaks about walking according to spirit, and in Galatians 5:25 he says, "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, in Philippians 3:10 he says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nothing in the Psalms compares to this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, the Psalms speak about things such as being just and upright and holding on to our integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize, however, that justice, uprightness, and integrity are not spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Spirituality is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since only the Spirit is spirituality, whatever we have apart from the Spirit is not spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As New Testament believers, it is not right for us to take, without adequate discernment, all the psalmists' pious expressions uttered out of their complex sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should use their pious expressions as a background for us to know the spiritual things in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to see the contrast between the Psalms and the spirituality revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not pursue the justice, uprightness, and integrity we see in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, we should pursue the genuine spirituality we see in the New Testament a spirituality which is actually the divine life lived out of us by the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is real spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we practice such a spirituality, we will not pray for the Lord to destroy our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the contrary, we will pray, "Lord, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, have mercy on them that they may repent and receive You by believing into You."</S>
