<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of four messages given by Brother Witness Lee concerning prayer. According to the notes of Brother Kwang-Hsi Weigh, the first message was given in Hong Kong on September 2, 1956. The dates when the remaining messages were given are not known, but it can be inferred that they were given over the same period in Hong Kong. These messages were previously published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in 1957.</p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
