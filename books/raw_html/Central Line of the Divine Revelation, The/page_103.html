<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. By Being Convicted by the Comforter,<br>the Spirit of Reality</H2><P>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by being convicted by the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, concerning sin (from Adam), concerning righteousness (Christ), and concerning judgment (the devil's eternal portion), that we may be justified and regenerated (16:8-11). On the one hand, the Spirit is the Comforter; on the other hand, He is the Convicter, the One who rebukes and reproaches. The best comforter always rebukes. If one always speaks well of you, he is a deceiver and has an evil intention. If one is an honest and faithful comforter, he will rebuke and reproach. He will tell others that as long as they do a certain improper thing, they will suffer and not have any comfort. He will exhort them to have a change and be corrected. The Comforter is the Spirit of reality. He comes to comfort us with convicting. He convicts us of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. Sin came from Adam, and righteousness is Christ. We must give up Adam, that is, put sin aside, and receive Christ as our righteousness. Otherwise, we will participate in the judgment that is the ultimate portion of the devil. We came from Adam, but if we come to Christ, He will become our righteousness, and we will not suffer the eternal judgment that is the devil's portion. We will be justified to have Christ as our righteousness and be regenerated to have the Spirit as our life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. By Receiving the Riches<br>of the Triune God  through the Transmission<br>of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ is also by receiving the riches of the Triune God through the transmission of the Divine Trinity that we may partake of all the realities for His glorification. In John 16:13-15a the Lord Jesus said, "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality...He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine." Christ has inherited whatever the Father has. The riches of the Father's being are Christ's inheritance; what Christ inherits from the Father is received by the Spirit; and whatever the Spirit receives of Christ He declares to us. This is a transmission. The riches are in the Father as the source; they pass through the Son as the course; and the Spirit is the reaching to us of all the riches of the Triune God. From the Father, through the Son, and by the Spirit, all the riches of the Triune God become our portion. We enjoy this blessing by being one with the Triune God and allowing the transmission from the Triune God to reach us. In this way we have the riches of the Triune God by the divine transmission.</P>
