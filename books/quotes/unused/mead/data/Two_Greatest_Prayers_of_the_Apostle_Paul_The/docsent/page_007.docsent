   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Freedom of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do have a hope as a result of our being called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This hope is that we will be transformed and transfigured, thoroughly conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we look at ourselves, we realize that we have many flaws.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Physically, I have many wrinkles and spots.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But one day, we will all be the same as Christ, not only inwardly, spiritually, but even outwardly, physically.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will be absolutely like Christ in His glory 1 John 3:2; Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, Christ in us is our hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But one day, all my wrinkles and spots will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I cannot tell you how wonderful, beautiful, and glorious we will be!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, because we are still under corruption, we groan in ourselves Rom 8:23 , waiting eagerly for that day of glory when we will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God v. 21 . We will be delivered out of groaning to enjoy the freedom of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is our hope, our destiny, and also our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day by day, we are marching onward toward this destination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our hope is that, one day, we will arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This destination is not the heavens, but the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are all fully conformed to the image of Christ, we will be in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, I am fully content to be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church, we are on our way to glory, and this glory is the hope of our calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD'S INHERITANCE IN THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second matter that Paul prays for us to know is "the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints" Eph 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that God's inheritance in the saints is the Christ that has been wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, the Christ that has been wrought into us is the church, so the church is God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This matter is very deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that the church is an organization, a group of religious people, or any kind of social or religious entity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is simply Christ wrought into us in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE TRANSMISSION OF GOD'S POWER PRODUCING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third matter that the apostle prays for us to see is "the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe" v. 19 . We must pay attention to the short phrase, toward us, in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This great power is not something which is unrelated to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This power is toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Continually, this great power is directed toward us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are the object of this power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never forget the four items which constitute this power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, it is the power that raised up Jesus from among the dead v. 20 , the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, it is the power that seated Christ at the right hand of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>20-21 , the transcending power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It cannot be held down, suppressed, or oppressed; it transcends everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Third, this power subjected all things under the feet of Christ v. 22 . This is the subduing power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fourth, it is the power that gave Christ to be Head over all things v. 22 . This is the overruling power that rules over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to realize this power in all of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This great power is the resurrection, transcending, subduing, and overruling power, and it is this power that produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Experiencing the Divine Transmission</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 19, this great power is "toward us who believe."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To receive God's power, there is no other condition than that of believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as you believe in the Lord Jesus, this power is toward you and even in you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then verse 22 says that Christ has been given to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word "to" indicates a transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we have a divine transmission of all the power which God has wrought in Christ into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we may see this, it could be merely a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must also see how to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To experience this power, the first thing we need to realize is that this power is in us already.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is just like the electricity that has already been installed into a building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But with most of us, our "amperage" is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our capacity to receive the transmission of this power is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This power has been installed into us, but because our capacity is too small, many times in our experience "the fuse burns out," and the power does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must all look to the Lord that our capacity may be enlarged that we may experience the power that is within us.</S>
