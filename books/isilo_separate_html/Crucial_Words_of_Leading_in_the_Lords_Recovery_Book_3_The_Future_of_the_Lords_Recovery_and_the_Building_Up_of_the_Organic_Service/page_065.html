THE ELDERS&rsquo; ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We might think that in the church we should obey the elders. However, there is not a verse in the Bible says only that the church belongs to the elders. The Bible says only that the church is the church, or the churches, of God (1 Cor. 1:2; 11:16); the church of Christ, or the churches, of Christ (Rom. 16:16); and the church of the saints (1 Thes. 1:1). The Bible never says that the church is the church of the elders, nor does it say that the church is the church of the apostles. In other words, the owners of the church are God, the Lord, and the saints. First, we all should listen to the Lord. Second, since the affairs of the church are also practical and require human service, in matters related to service the owner of the church is not the elders but the saints.</p>
<p>This is the reason Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 5 that the saints should not make an accusation against the elders, except on the word of two or three witnesses (v. 19). The Bible does not speak of people making an accusation against their parents, but it does mention saints making an accusation against the elders. We think that we should obey the elders because the church is under the elders&rsquo; control, administration, and management, but Paul still speaks of the saints being able to bring an accusation against the elders. The important point here is that the New Testament does not have the thought that the elders are lords over the church. Speaking to the disciples, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are all brothers&rdquo; (Matt. 23:8). He also told them that whoever desired to be the greatest should be a servant and a slave (20:26-27).</p>
<p>During the training on the Life-study of Matthew, we emphasized this matter in relation to the sisters who are the wives of elders, saying, &ldquo;You are all the wives of elders, and it seems that because your husbands are elders, you have become &lsquo;first ladies.&rsquo; This is absolutely wrong. You must know that the elders among us are slaves. If your husbands were not elders, you would not be slave-ladies, but once your husbands became elders, you became slave-ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite strongly concerning this matter, and I believe that Peter received this word. When he wrote his first Epistle, he said, &ldquo;The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder...Shepherd the flock of God among you...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (5:1-3). <em>Lording it over</em> means to exercise lordship over the ruled. <em>Becoming patterns of the flock</em> implies that the elders are also sheep. They are in the flock as the head sheep. They should take the lead by walking in the front, not by running or jumping wildly or leaving the flock. When it is time to graze, they must take the lead to graze. When it is time to drink, they must take the lead to drink. They must also obey the Shepherd. In this way, the flock will be willing to follow them. This is what it means to become &ldquo;patterns of the flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must always remember that an elder is not the owner of a church or a superior official; he is just one sheep among the flock. An elder is an elder because he obeys the Lord; he grazes when he should graze and drinks when he should drink. He grazes when it is time to graze, he drinks when it is time to drink, and he is more obedient than the other sheep. He is a pattern in every way, so he becomes an elder. This is the same as becoming the head sheep. The other sheep simply follow his lead. This is what it means to be an elder. Being an elder is not to lord it over others but to become a pattern of the flock.</p>
<p>The Bible is complete. Peter knew that after hearing this word, the young saints could become puffed up in themselves and not follow the leading of the elders, so he continued, &ldquo;Younger men, be subject to elders&rdquo; (v. 5). The Greek word for <em>elders</em> in this verse is the same word used in verse 1. Peter seemed to be saying, &ldquo;It is true that the elders should not lord it over you, but they are patterns of the flock. Therefore, do not think that since they are also sheep, you do not have to obey them. On the contrary, you younger men still have to be subject to the elderly ones. You have to be subject to the elders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had much experience, and he was afraid that when the elders heard his word, they would say, &ldquo;Peter clearly told you to subject yourselves to the elders, so that means you must subject yourselves to us.&rdquo; Hence, Peter continued by saying, &ldquo;All of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another&rdquo; (v. 5). In other words, the younger sheep must obey the older sheep, and the older sheep must listen to the younger sheep. We must all be subject one to another. Only then have we girded ourselves with humility.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s word here is balanced. He made sure that the saints were not an unturned cake (Hosea 7:8). We should receive this reminder. If we always rely on the elders, we will be an unturned cake, a cake that is cooked on only one side. We must turn the cake. The younger ones must submit to the elders, and the elders and the younger ones must submit to one another. In this way the practical affairs of the church will be carried out smoothly. This is the teaching in the Bible.</p>
<p>In the world people must submit to kings. However, no one in the world says that kings and their subjects must submit to one another. If this were the case, kings would lose their status and position; they would be on the same level as everyone else. We are all before the Lord, but we may harbor a deep-rooted natural concept. Some churches are in this situation. When a local church is raised up, the responsibility for leading the church is given to the elders. However, the elders may think that they are bosses and lords, so only what they say matters. We must not have such a concept. Even though the responsibility for leading the church has been given to the elders, the elders are not the owners of the church, and they should not lord it over anyone. The church belongs to the Lord. The church should be ruled by the Lord. He is the only One with absolute authority. The elders are merely patterns of the flock.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
