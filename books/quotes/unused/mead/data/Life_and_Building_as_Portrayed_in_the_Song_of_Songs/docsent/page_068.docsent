   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILT UP AND BUILT IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we eat Jesus, all the nourishing elements of His life give us the metabolism which produces all kinds of expressions in our human conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is especially true in the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By these experiences we are not only built up, but also built in. If others try to pull us out of the church, they cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To pull us out they would have to pull out the whole church, for we are built in. I am burdened for those who are on the outskirts of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they are not built in by experiencing the humanity of Christ, Satan will tempt them to leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But, praise the Lord, Christ is such a One whom we can experience!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can tell you that for the past forty years I have been solidly built in. There is such a real thing as the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if others were to kill me, they could not pull me out of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The longer we stay in the church life, the more our peculiarity is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the saints are peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without the church, we might consider ourselves quite normal, but after being in the church life for a time, we begin to realize that we are peculiar and even abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the transformation which comes by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we are transformed, the more we can fit into the situation, and the more we can make allowances for others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we are really built in.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's recovery is just the building up, and by the Lord's mercy we are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a real shame to the enemy and a glory to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing is so glorious to the Lord Jesus as the building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And this is why nothing satisfies us like the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How He is satisfied with the building!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And how much we ourselves have been satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are satisfied, it is a sign that He is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, when we are not satisfied, He is not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both we and the Lord can only be satisfied with the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the only way to prepare for His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is going to build up the church in many places to shame the enemy and prepare His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the Lord's building today, and many more are going to be built in. Although we do not care for numbers, I do believe that we will see a large number of good, solid ones added to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the Lord's recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May the Lord grant us the sufficient grace for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I love Thee, Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And Thy love to me</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Draws me, ever to seek Thee</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And run after Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Draws me, ever to seek Thee</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And run after Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thou art beloved,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yea! altogether lovely,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The One in whom my heart delighteth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Repeat last 3 lines of each verse</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thy love, Lord Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is sweeter than wine,</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And Thy fragrance of ointments</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My heart doth entwine,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And Thy fragrance of ointments</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My heart doth entwine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A fount in gardens,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A well of living waters,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Which streams and flows from Lebanon's mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>O come Beloved,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On my garden blow,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That the odor of spices</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May break forth and flow,</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That the odor of spices</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May break forth and flow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>My spouse, my sister,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I'm come into my garden</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To feast upon wine, milk, and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Set me, Lord Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A seal on Thine heart,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And love's strong as death</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And love's strong as death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Much water cannot</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Quench love, nor do floods drown it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All man could give for love is contemned.</S>
