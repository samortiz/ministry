This verse unveils three items which Paul wanted to know. First, Paul wanted to know Him. Second, he wanted to know the power of His resurrection. Third, he wanted to know the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</P><P>We want to see the practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation, which is not out of man's imagination but in the Holy Scriptures. This high peak is that God became man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. The eternal, infinite, self-existing, ever-existing, and almighty God one day became a man, like you and me. The human race has a history of about six thousand years, from the creation of Adam to our time. God became a man only about two thousand years ago.</P><P>About four thousand years before God became a man, He created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Man is in the image of God and after the likeness of God. Suppose a little boy made a clay toy in the image and likeness of a lion. When the little boy's friend saw it, he would say, "You have made a lion." Surely that is a real toy, but it is in the image of a lion. God made a real man according to His kind, not according to man's kind. Actually, man in himself has no kind. Mankind is "Godkind." One day God shaped some clay in His own image and after His own likeness. That man was according to God's kind. We human beings are in God's kind.</P><P>After His creation of man He did not do anything to mingle Himself with man for four thousand years. But He did promise mankind that a threefold seed would come: the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15), the seed of Abraham (22:18), and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12-14). The seed of the woman would bruise the head of Satan, the seed of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations on earth, and the seed of David would build up God's temple and set up God's kingdom. In the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 these three seeds are one person, Christ.</P><P>There is also a prophecy in the Old Testament saying that a virgin would be with child and bear a son (Isa. 7:14). This is the fulfillment of the promise of the seed of the woman. Isaiah said that this human son, this human child, is called the Mighty God and the Eternal Father (9:6). That is God Himself. Thus, the threefold seed is God Himself. God is divine, and the threefold seed is human. This indicates that the divine God would become a human seed, a man. Micah 5:2 says that out of Bethlehem would come forth a ruler, whose goings forth are of old, from the days of eternity. We can see such a record in the Old Testament, but after God created man in His kind, He did not do anything for His New Testament economy for four thousand years. Within these four thousand years, He promised and prophesied that He would come to be a man.</P><P>In the whole universe there was God, there were the angels, there were men, but there had never been a God-man. One day an extraordinary event took place. Jesus was born. He is both God and man, the God-man. God became a man by the name of Jesus. This God-man became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29), and the firstborn Son indicates, no doubt, that many brothers will follow. In eternity before God created man, He had chosen millions of men to be His many sons (Eph. 1:4-5). Today our being the many sons of God is not based upon creation, but based upon God's selection, God's choosing.</P><P>He chose us in eternity past, and one day He regenerated us. He regenerated us on the same day Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). In His resurrection we were born to be the many sons of God. This indicates that the firstborn Son is a prototype, and the many sons are the mass reproduction. What should we as the reproduction of the firstborn Son of God be? We should be the God-men. He was the first God-man, the prototype. He was the original copy for xeroxing, and we are the following copies. We should be exactly the same as He is. He is a God-man, and we should be the God-men.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
