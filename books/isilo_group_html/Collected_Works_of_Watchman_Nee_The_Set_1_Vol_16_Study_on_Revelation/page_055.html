Revelation 16:5</H2><P>"And I heard the angel who had power over the waters saying, You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, because You have judged these things."</P><P>There is an angel that specifically rules the waters. In 1:8 and 4:8 we have "He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty." In 11:17 and 16:5, the expression "who is coming" is absent. Therefore, the Lord's coming again must be after chapter four and before 11:17.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Revelation 16:6-7</H2><P>"For they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink; they are worthy of it. And I heard the altar saying, Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments." Revelation 16:6 refers to the prophets, which indicates that there is a second Pentecost, because prophets are one type of gift.</P><P>"True" is related to promises. "Righteous" is related to principles. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Fourth Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:8-9)</H2><P>"And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire. And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory." </P><P>In the fourth trumpet the heavens became only darkened, but this time the heat of the sun burns man (Luke 21:25). According to scientists' calculations, the heat of the sun should diminish continually, but here God reverses it (Psa. 121:6). The burning in Isaiah 24:6 probably refers to the heat of the sun scorching man (cf. Isa. 42:25; Deut. 32:24; Mal. 4:1). Men think of the pain they are suffering, but do not consider the reason for their suffering. They do not pay attention to the eternal gospel preached in Revelation 14:6-7 by the first angel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Fifth Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:10-11)</H2><P>"And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores; and they did not repent of their works."</P><P>These two verses are related to the angels that came out of the abyss in the fifth trumpet. The pain in verse 10 is due to the sores of the first bowl and the burning of the sun of the fourth bowl. They have the plagues of each of the previous bowls, plus the present darkness (Psa. 64:3-8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Sixth Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:12-16)</H2><P>Revelation 16:12 refers specifically to the sixth bowl, while verses 13 to 16 are inserted visions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Revelation 16:12</H2><P>"And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared." </P><P>"The great river Euphrates." The boundaries that God promised to the children of Israel were from Egypt to the Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). In addition, history tells us that when the Roman Empire was at its peak, it also had the Euphrates as its boundary. In the future there will be a great confederation of two parties. One party will be the Western world with the Mediterranean Sea as its center and the ancient Roman Empire as its boundary (including England, France, the northern part of Africa, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and all the way to the lands of India and Persia). The other party will be the Eastern world with Russia as its center (including the Persians, the Ethiopians, the Armenians, etc., and perhaps China, Japan, Afghanistan, etc.).</P><P>In the future, the religious influence will spread from Rome to reach the whole earth; however, the political influence will not be the same. Italy's Fascist Black Party and Russia's Communist Red Party will be the two most influential parties in the world.</P><P>The armies from the east mentioned in Ezekiel 38:1-6 will cross the river to fight with the armies from the west. They will have already come to attack once during the sixth trumpet. The fighting in the seventh trumpet will be even more fierce.</P><P>"Armageddon." Megiddo is the name of a place. Ar means mountain. Armageddon is the mountain of Megiddo. This place is called Jezreel in the Old Testament.</P><P>Originally, the Euphrates River was quite broad with rapid currents and was not easy to cross over. However, when the sixth bowl is poured out, the water in the river will be dried up, and it will become easy to cross over.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 55</div><br></body></html>
