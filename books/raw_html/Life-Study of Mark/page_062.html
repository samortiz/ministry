<h2 class="head1">THREE CRUCIAL MATTERS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Ten Commandments</h2><p>If we study 7:1-23 carefully, we shall see that the Lord&rsquo;s word here actually covers all of the Ten Commandments. The Lord even uses the word &ldquo;commandment&rdquo; in verse 8: &ldquo;Leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men.&rdquo; Then in verse 9 He goes on to say, &ldquo;You nicely set aside the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.&rdquo; In verse 13 the Lord speaks of the word of God, pointing out that the religious ones were invalidating the word of God by their tradition. In this portion of the Gospel of Mark the commandments are the word of God.</p><p>As we study this portion of Mark, we see that here the Lord&rsquo;s word is concerned with the worship of God. The first four of the Ten Commandments are related to the worship of God. The fifth commandment is about honoring our parents. In verse 10 the Lord specifically refers to the commandment to honor our father and mother. The remainder of the Lord&rsquo;s word recorded here deals with the last five commandments, the commandments about fornication, theft, murder, false witness, and covetousness.</p><p>If we consider all these matters together, we shall see that the Lord&rsquo;s conversation with the Pharisees and scribes, the crowd, and the disciples was based on the Ten Commandments. For the Pharisees and scribes to invalidate the word of God meant that they were invalidating the Ten Commandments. It is important for us to see that in this section of the Gospel of Mark the Ten Commandments are covered by the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p><h2 class="head2">Tradition and Man&rsquo;s Heart</h2><p>Mark 7:1-23 actually covers three crucial matters: the commandment of the Lord, the word of God; the tradition of man; and the real condition of man&rsquo;s heart. The condition of man&rsquo;s heart is always exposed by the word of God, or the commandments of God. But the tradition of man always covers up the condition of man&rsquo;s heart. For this reason, wherever tradition is maintained there is hypocrisy. Instead of exposing the real situation of man, tradition covers it. The Lord even says that the Pharisees and scribes &ldquo;nicely set aside the commandment of God&rdquo; so that they could keep their tradition (v. 9).</p><p>Apparently traditions are good. Actually they are subtle, and those who maintain such traditions are hypocrites. In religion today there is much hypocrisy because there is so much tradition to cover up man&rsquo;s real condition. But the word of God always exposes man&rsquo;s inward situation.</p><p>In this short portion of the Gospel of Mark, the Ten Commandments are applied. The Lord Jesus is actually repeating the Ten Commandments and using them to expose man&rsquo;s inward condition. Whereas the Pharisees and scribes were concerned with the washing of hands, there is no mention of such washing in the Ten Commandments. What is important in the application of the Ten Commandments is not that we wash our hands, but that we come to worship God with a sincere heart, honor our parents, and faithfully carry out our duties. God&rsquo;s commandments do not expose the dirt on man&rsquo;s hands; they expose the filthiness in man&rsquo;s heart. Therefore, the Lord repeats the Ten Commandments in order to uncover the actual condition of man&rsquo;s heart. I encourage you to look into this portion of the Gospel of Mark according to these points.</p>
