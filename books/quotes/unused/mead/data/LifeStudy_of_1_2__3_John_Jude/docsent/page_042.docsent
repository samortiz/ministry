   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Spiritual Attorney</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is also correct to translate parakletos in 1 John 2:1 as Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The situation in 1 John 2:1 is different from that in John 14:16; it is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the word attorney does not seem fitting to use in the actual translation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, after much consideration, we selected the word Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Advocate in 2:1 is actually a spiritual attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This parakletos stands beside us, like a nurse caring for us, and serves us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The parakletos is also a counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At school the students have a counselor to help them choose the right courses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our parakletos also helps us in making choices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his translation of 1 John 2:1 J. N. Darby uses the word patron.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his note he explains that the word patron is used in the sense of a Roman patron, who maintained the interest of his client in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One function of a Roman patron was much like that of an attorney today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The attorney then takes care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the function of our Advocate in 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Parakletos is an all-inclusive word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It includes the concept of an advocate, an attorney, who takes care of our case.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With the Father</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John tells us in 2:1 that we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The phrase with the Father is used also in 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In each case the Greek word translated with is pros, with the accusative, a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus as our Advocate is living in communion with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John s use of Father as the divine title here indicates that our case, which the Lord Jesus as our Advocate undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between children and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through regeneration we have been born children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After regeneration, in case we sin, it is a matter of children sinning against their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our Advocate, who is our propitiation, undertakes for our sinning to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father so that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past I wondered why John told us that we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An advocate is someone involved in cases of law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can easily see why we may need an advocate, an attorney, with the judge in a court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But why do we need an advocate with our Father?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The answer to this question is that the case of our sins after regeneration is a matter involving the Father and the family law court.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we sin, we offend our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our judge, therefore, is a Father-judge, our court is our spiritual home, and our case is a family matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we do have a member of our family, our elder Brother, the Lord Jesus, who is our Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As our Advocate, our elder Brother takes our case.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason John does not say that we have an Advocate with God, but says that we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A child may have the mistaken idea that because his father loves him, he can do anything he wants at home with his family.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although our Father loves us, any sins we commit are an offense against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yes, God is our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we sin, He will have a case against us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in our spiritual family we sometimes need an Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this verse we have two important titles Advocate and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The title Father indicates that we are in the divine family enjoying the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The title Advocate indicates that we may be wrong in certain matters and need someone to take our case.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, in family life we need our elder Brother to be our Advocate who takes our case.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The truth in the Bible is always presented in a balanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The truth in this verse is also balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, the title Father is a sign of love; on the other hand, the title Advocate is a sign of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, a father loves his child.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if the child misbehaves, the father will have a case against him, a case based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the child is still loved by his father and will continue to be taken care of by him, the father has a case against the child and may need to discipline him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a similar way, whenever we sin, the Father has a case against us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we need a heavenly attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need Jesus Christ, our elder Brother, to be our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have emphasized the fact that Christ is our Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Please notice that John does not say that we have an Advocate with God, or that we have the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, he tells us that if we sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
