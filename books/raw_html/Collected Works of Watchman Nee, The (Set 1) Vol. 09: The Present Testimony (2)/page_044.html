<P>The Lord said clearly to David, that even if his descendants were to forsake His commandments and break His laws, He could not break His covenant. Do you know when Psalm 89 was written? It was written at the time the Jews were captured in Babylon, at the time of captivity. The people thought that God had forgotten His covenant with David. God promised that David's descendants would continue on the throne, and that his kingdom and house would be forever. But the kingdom was gone, and the people were exiled into the enemy's land. Where was the king? How could the kingdom and house be established? In the middle of all these visible things, the psalmist said to God, "But thou hast cast off and abhorred, / thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. / Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: / thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground" (vv. 38-39). First he mentioned God's covenant. Then he continued with the captivity of his countrymen and their suffering under the enemy. When he came to verse 49, he seized the covenant and interrogated God, "Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses, / which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?" Notice this word: "Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses, / which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?" Friends, have we ever prayed this way? Have we ever been so bold in our prayer? Many people beg for the Lord's mercy like beggars. We have never said to God, "Lord, execute the covenant that You made with me according to Your faithfulness." The Holy Spirit purposely records this interrogating prayer to God; it shows us that God loves to see us interrogating Him according to a "handle" in His word. When we do this, it gives Him far more glory. We have said many wavering words to God; all these words come from an evil heart of unbelief. Although we have prayed to God, we do not have any assurance at all. How can God answer our prayers? The problem is not on God's side, but on our side. If we believe, God will surely forgive our sins and cleanse our unrighteousness. He will surely fill us with the Holy Spirit and give His life to us so that we can live, grow, and be obedient children according to His new life. With His life, we will become perfect, even as His Son the Lord Jesus was perfect, clean, undefiled, and without blemish. Can we achieve all this? On God's side, there is no problem. The problem is whether or not we will believe in His word. Just as He made a covenant with David and promised His loving-kindness to him, He has made a covenant with us, who have believed in the name of His Son, and has promised us unmatched spiritual blessings. God loves to see us drawing nigh to Him, seeking after Him, and interrogating Him according to His covenant. He loves to see us taking His same standing and communicating with Him, demanding that He fulfill all that He has promised in His covenant. At this point, I have to exalt and thank God, for He has given us many "handles" in His Word so that we can lay hold of them and apply them.</P><P>Our God is worthy of all praises. He will surely fulfill what He has promised and covenanted with us. Brothers and sisters, have you ever realized that God has given us "handles" in His Word by which we can believe in Him? Today, we present you this glorious truth. God has not only given us His promises and facts, He has given us the greatest handle of allâ€”His covenant, by which we can lay hold of Him. Tomorrow we will see how much this covenant includes. Presently we have seen that God has made a covenant with us and promised to accomplish the things said in the covenant for us. The believers who are weak, despondent, and cold should realize that God has made a covenant with us. He has put this handle in our hand. Let us come to Him in all boldness, interrogate Him according to this covenant, and deal with Him because this is His Word. He says that whoever believes in Him will see Him accomplishing things for them. The only reason the church is so feeble in strength is that it does not know the new covenant. The new covenant has been forgotten!</P><P>Has not the Bible taught us about the new covenant? When we read the Bible, we will find out that we are now in the New Testament age; we will see that the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood for the enactment of the new covenant. Since we know the Bible and the term the new covenant, why are we so weak and powerless? The reason is that the letter kills, while the Spirit gives life. We know that this is the New Testament age, but we do not know how to bargain with God and apply God's promises to us. In this conference, we want to consider how precious and wonderful the covenant is. We want to see how much the new covenant includes. But in order to receive the blessing of the new covenant, we must have an honest and upright heart before God. We must not only listen to the truth and know about the truth, we must also receive God's revelation before we can have the strength to believe and to receive. Psalm 25:14 says, "The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them." Unless the Lord shows us His covenant, we have no way to know about it. We can hear men speaking about God's covenant, and our mind can understand something concerning the covenant. But when we go home, we are still the same as before; we have not received anything. We are still weak and have not taken hold of God's Word. We need God to grant us a revelation in our spirit. However, we must first fear God before He can show us anything. What does it mean to fear God? Fearing God means wanting God, desiring single-heartedly to keep His will, being fully submissive to Him, wanting nothing of ourselves, walking not according to our will, seeing not ourselves, and seeing God's greatness alone. According to the Hebrew language, Psalm 25 is in parallel form, where two sentences are parallel one to another, saying the same thing. The first sentence says that the Lord reveals His intimate counsel to those who fear Him. The second sentence says that He will make His covenant known to them. From this we see that the intimate counsel of the Lord is His covenant, the covenant of God. Today, God's intimate counsel, the covenant, is before us. We should fear Him, exalt Him, and consider ourselves as nothing. In this way we will see God's covenant; we will be able to inquire of God by laying hold of His covenant, and we will receive the blessing of the new covenant. May God work in this conference. May He attract men and lead men to know His secret. On the one hand, we have to be careful about God's covenant because this is holy ground, and everyone who comes to Him has to fear Him. On the other hand, may we come boldly before Him because this covenant is filled with grace.</P>
