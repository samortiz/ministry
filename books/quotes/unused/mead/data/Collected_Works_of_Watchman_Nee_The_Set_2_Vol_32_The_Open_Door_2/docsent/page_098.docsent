   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADDRESSES OF A FEW LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Omitted</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Recently there has been much frustration on the mail routes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The post office will not deliver printed material that is not officially approved to many places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result many copies of Issue No. 15 were returned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to communicate with various places, we have sent the magazine out as letters instead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why many places which subscribed for more than one copy have received only one copy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can only do the same thing with this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those places which have received only one copy should pass on the news to other brothers and sisters in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 Since we have to send the magazine out as letters, we have stopped printing the column "The Dynamics of Service" in order to reduce the number of pages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3 We have sent copies of the magazine to all those who have subscribed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have not received a copy, it is either because the post office has refused to forward printed material or because it has been delayed in the mail.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At critical times these things can happen all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have not received anything for a long time, please inform us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will pay more postage and send a copy to you as a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4 We thank the Lord for the relief work to the saints in need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His grace is abundant!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to our knowledge, Kuei-yang, Wuhan, Szechuan, and Chungshan have no more needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are still paying attention to areas around Hunan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are more needs in areas around north Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is quite difficult to forward funds by mail.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can only look to the Lord to open a way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In supplying the needs of the saints, we are constantly afraid of neglecting the ones who are really in need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are looking to the Lord with a pure heart often do not say anything concerning their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that those who know their real need will inform the responsible brothers in their locality, lest we owe them something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5 Rumors and one-sided reports should not be taken lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord would either carefully screen letters that spread reports about the churches or ignore them altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believing in these reports lightly only provides an opening for attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if anyone is wrong or if any church has any weakness, we should speak the truth in love Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our exhortations should be in Christ Phil 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Evil-intentioned criticism, inaccurate reports, and shady, anonymous letters are not Christian acts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot act as the unbelievers do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although it is not an easy thing to speak the truth, love would rather see ourselves suffering hurt in order to save ourselves from misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>6 When the brothers and sisters quote from the book Rethinking Our Work, they should do so because the point quoted is according to Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why we act according to what it says, and only when we act this way will we receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If one says that he does this or that because the book says so, others will misunderstand that we consider this book to be more important than the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have no intention of doing this, and we dare not uplift any book more than the authority of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be careful in our words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>7 Some brothers and sisters say that they have received the calling to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should rejoice and thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some co-workers do not know these ones well, and therefore cannot recommend them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that these called ones are not qualified to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I wish all the young brothers and sisters who are called by the Lord would be like Henry Moore in England.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mr. Moody neglected him in the beginning because he did not know him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, when Mr. Moody heard his preaching, he was driven to tears.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This caused a change in Mr. Moody's preaching from that point on.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is this vindication not better than many self-recommending commendations?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a calling is genuine and the timing is right, what does one have to fear?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the calling is not clear, one should wait and examine even when there is sympathy and encouragement on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is something that we should not handle in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ruth Lee in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>April 11, 1939</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>ANNOUNCEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Omitted</S>
