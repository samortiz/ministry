   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE THIRD TESTIMONY Given on October 20, 1936 Scripture Reading: Acts 26:29 LIVING A LIFE OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having given two testimonies, I had no intention of giving any more.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, while I was praying, it seemed that the Lord wanted me to testify once again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who know me are aware that I seldom testify regarding my own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It has been my observation that people often abuse others' testimonies, treating them as news for circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is also true that some testimonies are not sufficiently founded.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third-heaven experience of the apostle Paul was not disclosed to others until after fourteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regarding many spiritual testimonies, an appropriate length of time should be allowed to elapse before they are divulged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many, however, would speak them forth not in fourteen years, but in fourteen days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matters concerning Money</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The matter of money can be either a small or a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I began to serve the Lord, I was somewhat anxious about the question of my livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Had I been a preacher in a denomination, I would have been on a large monthly salary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But since I was to walk in the Lord's way, I would only rely upon Him to support me; I could not depend upon a monthly salary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the years 1921 and 1922, very few preachers in China lived in sole reliance on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was difficult to find even two or three; the great majority lived on salary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time many preachers were not bold enough to devote their entire time to serving the Lord; they felt that if they were not receiving a regular salary, they would not know how to face a situation in which they had nothing to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I also had such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In China today 1936 there are approximately fifty brothers and sisters in fellowship with us who live by relying solely on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a situation is more common now than it was in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters in various places today also care for the workers more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I think that after ten years or so, brothers and sisters will show even greater concern for the need of the servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it was not very common ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Declaring to My Parents</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My Desire to Live by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have pointed out in a previous testimony that after I was saved I continued to study in school and at the same time work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One evening I spoke with my father concerning the matter of receiving financial assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said, "After praying for several days, I feel that I must tell you that I will no longer spend your money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I appreciate that you have spent so much on me in accord with your sense of fatherly responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But you will expect me to earn money in the future and support you in return, and I must tell you beforehand that since I am going to be a preacher, I will not be able to repay you in the future nor pay you interest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though I have not completed my studies, I wish to learn to depend solely upon God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I said this, my father thought I was joking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, from then on, when my mother would occasionally give me five or ten dollars, she would write on the envelope: "To Brother Nee To-sheng."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She was not giving me money as a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After I had expressed myself thus to my father, the devil came to tempt me by saying, "Such an act is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose one day you are unable to maintain your living and you again approach your father for money.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Won't that be disgraceful?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have spoken to your father too soon; you should have waited until there was more progress in your work, until many people had been saved and you had many friends, before you began to live a life of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But thank the Lord, ever since I expressed my decision to discontinue receiving my father's support, I have never asked him for money.</S>
