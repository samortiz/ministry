   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILT TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord wholly occupies us, we are one with all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This oneness is the meaning of being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit" Eph 2:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being close to certain saints is not what is meant by being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is when we are fully one with the Lord and saturated with Him that we are also one with all other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>DISPOSITIONAL HINDRANCES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The building comes as the element of Christ increases in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose you go to Japan and meet a Japanese brother there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You will sense a kinship with him, because you both have the life-giving Spirit, even if only in an initial way, connecting you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if you spend some length of time together, you will begin to feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not express his feelings, and you cannot tell if he is happy or annoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You speak so openly, but he is inscrutable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The American disposition differs from the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the same problem of disposition arises in a brothers' house where all are Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have the initial relationship through the life-giving Spirit, but friction arises even in the matter of washing dishes because each brother has his own disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though they are growing as they attend the meetings week by week, their disposition does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your disposition will faithfully cling to you year after year!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's economy is not to change your disposition but to fill you with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As He increases in you, you will gradually change.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Little by little you will be saturated with Him and your own dis position will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This organic, inward change, which is called sanctification and transformation, makes us one with other saints wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this is the case, we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please be clear that building among the saints is not intimacy, friendship, or affection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is purely the increase of Christ in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Christ to increase you must remain in, or return to, your spirit, where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not try to improve yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Practice staying in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you walk out, come back quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Especially work on this at home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is easy to be in spirit in the meetings or when you are with more spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The test comes when you are alone with your spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the easiest time to indulge your self.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May the Father strengthen us all into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts, and that we may be built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is His good pleasure.</S>
