<P>All the constituents needed for the constituting of His organic Body were produced in the threefold dispensing of the Divine Trinity. In Christ's unique transmitting, He put all these constituents together to form a Body. This Body is not merely a church as a gathering of called-out believers, but an organic constitution, the organism of the Triune God. This organism is also the unique house of the Triune God (1 Tim. 3:15), and this house is both the household and the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:19-22). The formation of the church as the Body of Christ was a great event on this earth, and even in the entire universe. The people of the world do not have the ability to see this, but we have the capacity to see it, because we were born of Him and were born into His kingdom (John 1:12-13; 3:5).</P><P>People who work in education have found out that in a human being there is a great capacity to learn. Even a three-year-old child can understand many things. There is a hidden capacity in those who were born as human beings. In addition to our human birth, we have experienced a new birth. We must believe that in this new birth there is a hidden capacity. The only thing we need is to develop that hidden capacity. A small child needs a little stirring up to bring out the hidden capacity within him. So Paul prayed that the Father would give the dear saints a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Actually, the wisdom is there already. Paul's prayer was just to stir up the hidden capacity so that we can understand God and His mysterious economy. No doubt the messages in this conference have stirred up our spiritual capacity, which we have by our spiritual birth. This is altogether the mercy of the Lord.</P><P>After you read the messages in this book, I would beg you to kneel down and pray: "Lord, I do not need anything today. I only need You. Grant me a favor by stirring up my spiritual capacity which I have from my spiritual birth. Stir up my spirit with wisdom so that I can understand. Lord, forgive me; until today my understanding of You and of the things concerning You has been altogether natural. Thank You that through this conference You have opened the veil to show us something. I am here waiting on You. Lord, day by day grant me a spirit of wisdom and revelation." I would encourage you to pray for this, dear saints, for at least one or two months.</P><P>In the past our vision depended too much on our natural concept, and our natural concept has been influenced by the traditional Christianity. It does not care for the capacity to understand God's economy, but it has done much to frustrate us, to distract us, and to bring us into darkness. We have been put into darkness by God's enemy Satan, by the power of darkness. He has caused God's holy Word to become dim without the light we need.</P><P>Nevertheless, how I thank the Lord that today the Bible is a shining book to us! The Lord's revelation still remains in His recovery. We need to worship Him for His oracle.</P><P>I urge you to go to the Lord with a praying spirit and tell the Lord, "Lord, I need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. I need to see much more of Your triune dispensing. I desire to see, dear Lord, that as the transcending One You are still carrying out a unique transmission." Without this transmission Watchman Nee could not have been raised up. To the great surprise of the missionaries in China, a native Chinese stood up to speak for God. During his ministry Brother Nee was very much opposed, but no opposition ever overcame him. This was due to the transmitting of the transcending Christ.</P><P>In this transmitting there is the transcending power. This power raised Christ up from death and Hades and caused Him to transcend far above the human beings on the earth and the evil angelic powers in the air and to sit at the peak of the universe. This power also subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church. Today we are enjoying the transmitting of the Lord's transcending power.</P>
