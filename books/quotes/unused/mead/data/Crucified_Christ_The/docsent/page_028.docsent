   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING THE LORD PURELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we experience the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person's spiritual experience begins with loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This love has to be single and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians' love for the Lord is not that pure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps someone will ask, "Do you mean that I have a hidden motive in loving the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, many Christians' love for the Lord is mixed with their own preference; thus, their love is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our love for the Lord should be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not desire anything besides Him, not even something for our spiritual enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should desire only the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our heart has to be ready to say, "O Lord, I want whatever is Your will, and I reject whatever is not Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we simply love the Lord, we will have the light to see that all that comes out of ourself has already been put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, we will reject everything that is of us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we have this light, we will be able to sense in our daily living that which is from ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we have such a feeling, we must take up our cross and obey this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we ignore and disobey this feeling, this means we have come down from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that moment we are separated from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CROSS DOING THE KILLING WORK</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we love the Lord, He will show us the cross and enable us to receive and bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way the cross will be able to work in us and do a killing work day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are about to do something by ourself, the cross will do a killing work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are about to love someone by ourself, the cross will do a killing work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are about to read the Bible by ourself, the cross will do a killing work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And when we are about to visit people by ourself, the cross will do a killing work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because we love the Lord, once we have the sense of the cross, we will obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because we love the Lord, we will receive and take up the cross and reject everything that is of ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, there is hardly anyone who always chooses the cross, who never rejects the cross, and who always acknowledges the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, God raises up many things in our environment to show us whether we are those who always choose the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times God prepares a wife or a husband for us to test us and to see if we will choose the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The purpose of the outward striking and the inward breaking is to find out if we will choose the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is in this kind of circumstance that many lovers and seekers of the Lord encounter difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we love the Lord and are willing to take the cross, the Lord will use the outward environment to see if we will truly take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes, because of our reluctance in taking the cross, God will use the environment to smite us and break us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If inwardly we are willing to always bear the cross, we will save ourselves from many outward troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often a person may seem to love the Lord, pursue the Lord, and be zealous for Him, but inwardly he has never seriously chosen the cross or taken up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So God must use many kinds of environments to deal with him and cause him to suffer the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these outward blows, breakings, and trials are due to his unwillingness to choose and take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we know the cross, we will welcome humiliation more than glory, difficulty more than ease, and adversity more than prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we know the cross, we will say that we only deserve to stay on the cross, be ended by the cross, and be terminated by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This glory is not something out of ourselves; it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THOSE WHO ARE PURE HAVING PASSED THROUGH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only those who have passed through the cross are single and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who have never passed through the cross can never be pure before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have never passed through the cross, even our humility will have the mixture of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, many times a Christian may seem to be holy outwardly, but inwardly he is filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When he says, "Thank you," the self is there, and when he shows his humility toward others, the self is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have the light of the cross, we will see that we are just filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unless the cross has removed our self, we are still unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The work of the cross in us is to take away our naturalness and our uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the Lord is merciful and gracious to us, many of our problems will be eliminated, and much of the friction will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church should be one, but without the breaking and dealing of the self through the cross, it is difficult to have this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only those who have passed through the cross know what genuine oneness is.</S>
