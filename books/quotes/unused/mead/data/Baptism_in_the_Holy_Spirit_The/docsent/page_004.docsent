   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MANIFESTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Christians always insist that speaking in tongues is a necessary manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But with two of the five cases in Acts the Samaritans and Saul of Tarsus nothing is mentioned about speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Students of the Scripture admit that many times what God does not mention is more meaningful than what He does mention.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With two of these five cases, no specific manifestation is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is an indication that a tongue is not the only or the necessary manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even with the other cases, there is no proof that all the believers spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Acts 19:6 states, "And when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Spirit came on them: and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Did every one of the twelve both speak in tongues and prophesy?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is possible but not probable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is more probable that some did one and some did the other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So even here, tongues are not the only manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Acts 2:4 says, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>" Not even this verse proves they all spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, when we say, "We all came to the meeting and began to pray," do we mean that we all prayed?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the same kind of composition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They all were filled with the Holy Spirit, but it is doubtful whether they all spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Corinthians 12:29-30 asks, "Are all apostles? are all prophets? do all speak with tongues?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The automatic answer to this question is that some do and some do not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not all are apostles, neither do all speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christians who insist on this matter interpret this verse as referring only to the exercise of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the initial manifestation, they say, everyone must speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But this is not logical!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How could one speak in tongues as an initial manifestation, but not in the exercise of the gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The facts of history also have much to say about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There have been many powerful and deeply spiritual persons over the centuries who have never spoken in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Watchman Nee has never spoken in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once he sent me a cable with only the words, "Not all speak in tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has studied the Word very thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have never met a man so well versed in the Scripture as he.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has found it unmistakably clear that "not all speak in tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To insist that all must speak in tongues is unscriptural, but to say that speaking in tongues is dispensationally over is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the entire New Testament only a small proportion is given to speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not mentioned at all in Romans, one of the basic books of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Neither is it mentioned in 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, or Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, Jude, or Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In all of the Epistles of the New Testament, it is only mentioned in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If our attitude is fair, we will admit that even in 1 Corinthians the apostle Paul speaks of tongues in the sense of limitation, adjustment, correction, and discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the very beginning of the book, he declares that Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ crucified is God's power and wisdom, and God has made Him wisdom to us: both righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that He is our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then in chapter two, he says that he determined to know nothing but Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He tells the Corinthian believers that they all had the gifts 1:7 ; yet their spiritual condition was babyish and carnal, that is, fleshly and even fleshy 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Greek, the word "carnal" in verse 1 means "fleshy" and in verse 3 means "fleshly."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he reaches chapter thirteen, he tells them of the "most excellent way" 12:31, ASV , the way of love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He says that even if we speak in the tongues of angels, without love that means without life, because love is the expression of life we are just sounding brass.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We make the sound, but we do not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In chapter fourteen, Paul encourages us to seek the gifts which are most profitable for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we read the entire book, we see that the matter of tongues is not touched in a positive way, but rather the contrary.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, in the Scripture, ground is given to the gift of tongues, but it is very limited.</S>
