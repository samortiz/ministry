   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The main point of this portion of the Word is that there are two kinds of disciples who have believed in the Lord and have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One kind denies the self and takes up the cross; the other kind is not willing to deny the self and take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The latter, seeking to gain the pleasures of the world for the self, are not willing to lose the soul; the former are willing to forsake all and lose their soul for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A disciple is a person set apart from the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Lord sets the self-denying disciples apart from the non-self-denying disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should know that our future position in the kingdom will be determined by our deeds today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is gained today is the same in nature as what will be gained in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is lost today is also the same in nature as what will be lost in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If today's gain means gaining the world and the denial of suffering, then the future's gain must be the gaining of the world and freedom from suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If today's loss means forsaking the world and the denial of one's own will, then the future's loss must also be losing the world and the non-fulfillment of one's own will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord means that whoever receives full satisfaction from the world now will lose his reigning position with the Lord in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this we see that the salvation of the soul is very different from what we usually refer to as the salvation of the spirit which means the salvation of gaining eternal life .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How is the spirit saved?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 3 tells us that "he who believes...has eternal life" v. 36 . Once a man believes, his spirit is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, saving the spirit means gaining eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How is the soul saved?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This portion of the Word tells us that only when a man loses his soul for the Lord's sake can his soul be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The salvation of the spirit is the gaining of eternal life, while the salvation of the soul is the gaining of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My spirit is saved by Jesus bearing the cross for me, whereas my soul is saved through my bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirit is saved because Jesus denied Himself for me, while the soul is saved by my denying of my self and following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The salvation of the spirit is based on believing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once a man believes, the matter is settled forever and cannot be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The salvation of the soul depends upon a life-long matter and a journey which has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The salvation of the spirit is based on faith because "he who believes...has eternal life" John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The salvation of the soul is based on deeds because "He will repay each man according to his doings" Matt 16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if all the demons rise up from hell to confound me, they cannot make me perish, and even if all the angels come down from heaven to smite me, they cannot make me perish either.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the Triune God Himself cannot make me perish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the spirit is saved, eternal life is assured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the salvation of the soul cannot be settled today; it can only be gained at the time of the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The salvation of the spirit is a matter of today because, once a man believes, he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The salvation of the soul is experienced at the time of the coming of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The salvation of the spirit is the gift of grace today because "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son" John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The salvation of the soul is a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a reward gained at the Lord's second coming by those who follow the Lord faithfully all their life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For a man's soul to be saved, he must be one whose spirit is saved first.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the spirit is not saved, there is no possibility for the soul to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We often speak of the salvation of the "spirit-soul" a Chinese idiomatic expression ; actually, according to the Bible, it is the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>MARK 8:31-38</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The record in Mark 8:31-38 is largely the same as in Matthew, but there is a little difference, which I shall now point out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"But whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it" v. 35 . Here three words are added, "and the gospel's." Most people think that this refers to those who preach the gospel for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if this is the case, would it not mean that only the soul of the preachers will be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not say "the preaching of the gospel's"; it only says "the gospel's."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What gospel is this gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the gospel spoken of in Mark 1:1: "The gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This gospel is the great salvation mentioned in Hebrews 2:3-4, which is "in leading many sons into glory" Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not the gospel of leaving Egypt and being freed from the slavery of sin; it is the gospel of entering into Canaan to receive glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Loses his soul-life for My sake" Matt 16:25 , is the result of being constrained by love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To "lose his soul-life for...the gospel's sake " Mark 8:35 is for the benefit of one's own future, which is for the sake of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation" Mark 8:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that he who is not willing to lose his soul-life is not willing to suffer for the Lord and His words in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In an adulterous and sinful generation, witnessing for the Lord's words indeed requires the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unless a man really loses his soul, he cannot, in such a generation, witness for the Lord, much less shamelessly witness for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of God's children are never willing, nor do they dare, to witness before man for the Lord who purchased them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The reason is that they want to save their faces and are afraid of others' ridicule.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to save one's soul in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such a person will definitely suffer loss at the time of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everyone who is not willing to lose his soul in this age will not see the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everyone who will be a co-king with the Lord will have to lose his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone who loses his soul in this age will find it in the coming age.</S>
