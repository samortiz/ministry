   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter six, we see the last figure used by the Lord to describe the seeker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners" v. 4 . So we have the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Tirzah was the ancient capital of the king 1 Kings 14:17; 16:17-18 , and Jerusalem is the holy city of God Psa 48:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the last figure is really something of building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we have ten figures the first eight, and now the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides these ten figures, there are two more: the spring and the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, for the present we would like to put these two aside.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is clear, in any case, that the Lord Jesus mainly used these ten figures to describe this seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have become quite familiar with the first eight; now we must see the last two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GENESIS TO REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The garden and the city include the whole Bible from beginning to end. The Bible begins with a garden and it ends with a city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first two chapters of the Bible, there is a garden; in the last two chapters, there is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Song of Songs, the garden and the city are the very person of the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She fully corresponds now to the standard of God's eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible reveals that God's eternal will is firstly a garden and ultimately a city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why this book is so marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seeker of the Lord in this book becomes these very things a garden and a city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason we say that the Song of Songs covers the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It takes the whole Bible to describe the seeker because the Bible starts with the garden and concludes with the city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now she is the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The name of the garden is Paradise, and the name of the city is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves the divine inspiration of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No human mind could compose a book that fits so well in today's church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How did Solomon learn all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who told him about life and building?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet he wrote it all twenty-five hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that He has opened this book to us!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE CORPORATE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Almost all the teaching and edification given in Christianity is for the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone is trying to be individually spiritual, and most of the Bible teachers are doing their best to help others to be spiritual in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the whole Bible shows us that our spirituality should not be only individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All our spirituality must be for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some of the brothers in the church are carpenters who have helped to build houses and buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They know that each individual piece of material is not for itself; every piece is for the corporate building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I never heard anything in Christianity about the corporate building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But I did hear a great deal about this matter from Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For more than three years, from 1939 to 1942, he spoke all the time on the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time the Lord opened up to us the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The building in the Bible became so clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But today a message is rarely heard in Christianity about our need to be built up into a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord grant us doves' eyes so that we will have spiritual perception to see that spirituality is not merely for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spirituality is for the building up of the corporate city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE PROGRESSION TO THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The progression to the building is clearly seen in these ten figures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, there are the horses, then the doves' eyes, the lily, and the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a period of time there are the pillars of smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This figure of the pillars indicates building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then from the pillars we go to the couch and the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The palanquin is built up with certain materials.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then, comes the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All of these first eight figures are one group in the first section of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The conclusion for this group of figures is the palanquin for the Lord's move and the crown for the Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is really wonderful and marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seems that the seeking one has reached the peak and that nothing else is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I were the writer of this book, I would probably have closed the book here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It seems good enough to have the palanquin and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if this is all we have, it is merely individual spirituality, holiness, and maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everything is for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must realize that this book is divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The first eight figures in the first section describe and illustrate the seeking one up to the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the second section, two more figures are used by the Lord to describe this wonderful person: a garden and a city.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we only had the figures from the horses to the crown, we would have only some pieces and parts of the Scriptures; we would not have the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But when we come to the last section of the book, this wonderful seeker becomes the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now she fits into the entire Bible; we can apply the whole Bible to her from the beginning to the end. We can see her in the garden in Genesis 1 and 2, and we can also see her in the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She is both the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not just a personal, individualistic matter; it is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A garden is for growing, and a city is something built up.</S>
