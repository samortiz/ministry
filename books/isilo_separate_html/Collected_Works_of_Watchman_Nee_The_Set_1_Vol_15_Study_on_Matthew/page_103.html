They thought that the four Gospels, the Acts, etc. were not written for the Gentile believers. Scofield said that the Sermon on the Mount is exclusively for the Jews. However, he forgot Matthew 28:20: "Teaching them [the nations] to observe all that I have commanded you," and John 14:26: "And remind you of all the things which I have said to you." They use only Paul's word as the ground of their teaching. But please read Colossians 3:16, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."</P><P>F. "This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth...and then the end will come" (Matt. 24:14). They say that there is a difference between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace. To them, the time to preach the gospel of the kingdom was restricted to the time the Lord was on the earth and to the time before the tribulation. But our salvation is through the gospel of grace. They think that the gospel of grace does not need to be preached in all the world before one is raptured.</P><P>The gospel of the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the gospel of the kingdom of God. Acts 20:24-25 mentions the gospel of grace. The word of the kingdom of God in verse 25 is the gospel of grace mentioned previously in verse 24. In Acts 1:3 the Lord was teaching concerning the things of the kingdom of God, which would come in the future.</P><P>G. These maintain that when Christ was on the earth, He was a minister to the circumcision. Is it not true that what He said was said against the background of the Jews? Surely, it was. But the age of grace began also with the Lord. Please see the following verses: Matthew 11:13-14; Luke 16:16, "from that time," that is, from Christ's time; Acts 10:36-37; Acts 13:25-27, "the word of this salvation" began from John's time; Mark 1:1, "the gospel of Jesus Christ" began from John the Baptist; and Luke 4:17-19, which records that the gospel of grace is "today...fulfilled" (Luke 4:21). John 4:23 says that from the time of Jesus, another age began. In the age of the law man approached God in the flesh and by ordinances. If anyone touched a carcass, he was unclean and had to offer sacrifices to God; these are the fleshly ordinances. To come to God in the age of grace is to come in spirit and truthfulness. John 5:24-25 says, "And it is now." These two verses speak of the gospel of grace, which "is now."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN THE BIBLE<br>TO SHOW THAT THE CHURCH<br>WILL PASS THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>We shall consider a few references:</P><P>A. Second Thessalonians 2:1-9. Read carefully.</P><P>The first verse is the subject: the coming of Christ and the rapture. It does not speak only of Christ's coming; neither does it speak only of the rapture. Therefore, the rapture must be to the air. There are hints to show that it will occur after the tribulation. In verse 2 the word "us" includes Paul, and the word "spirit" refers to another spirit, not the Holy Spirit. "Word" means rumors. "The day of the Lord" is the day of the Lord's coming and the rapture. The first school regards the day of the Lord as the great tribulation. But this is wrong. Although the day of the Lord in the Old Testament always refers to the great tribulation, it is not necessarily so in the New Testament. For example, in 2 Peter 3:10 the day of the Lord refers to the things after the great tribulation and after the millennium. Since this is so, we must look at the context. First Thessalonians 2:1 very naturally refers to the second coming and the rapture. At that time there were people who tried to deceive the Thessalonians by saying that the Lord had already come and that they were left behind. In verse 3  "it" is "the day of the Lord," and "deceive" means to threaten or intimidate. Before the rapture, however, there must be two signs: (1) the appearing of the man of lawlessness, the son of perdition, that is, the Antichrist, and (2) the falling away, or the apostasy. This means that the man of lawlessness must be revealed before the rapture of the saints. When will the man of lawlessness be revealed? Of course, he will be revealed during the great tribulation. Thus, the rapture must be after the tribulation. Based on this, at least a part of the church must pass through the tribulation.</P><P>B. First Corinthians 15:50-55 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17: The first passage refers to the resurrection and the transfiguration; the second passage refers to the resurrection and the rapture. These two sections are parallel sections. Everyone agrees that the things mentioned in these passages occur at the same time. Are there any hints that point to the time? There is the blowing of the last trumpet. We know this must be after the tribulation. The first school says that the last trumpet is blown before the tribulation, but there is no ground for this, not even one verse in the Bible that shows this. The blowing of the last trumpet will take place after the tribulation; this last trumpet is the seventh trumpet of the seven trumpets. If the last trumpet was blown before the tribulation, this would be absurd because there would then be seven more trumpets after the last trumpet. This is like saying that after the last son there remain seven more sons. Mr. Janning (?) and others say that the trumpet here refers to the church's trumpet, not the trumpet of the tribulation. Where does the Bible mention anything about the first or the last trumpet of the church? Some among the Brethren say that this refers to the last trumpet in Roman military terminology, which was sounded before the whole legion marched, and that Paul borrowed it. But the Holy Spirit does not borrow from the Roman military terminology. Also, this is God's trumpet and not the church's trumpet. Certainly this is the last trumpet of the seven trumpets in Revelation. Moreover in Revelation 10:7, when the seventh trumpet is sounded, God's mystery is finished. This mystery refers to the church.</P><P>C. Miscellaneous evidences: (1) The consummation of the age: Matthew 24:3; 13:40; 28:20; "the age" equals aeon. The great tribulation is at the end of this age. If the rapture occurs before the tribulation, then this age will be three and a half years short. (2) The putting of the enemies under Christ's feet: 1 Corinthians 15:25; Acts 2:35. This event actually occurs after the tribulation. First Timothy 6:14 says, "Keep...until [after the tribulation] the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ." In Revelation no verse indicates that the Lord will leave the throne to come to the air before the tribulation. It is only after the tribulation begins that He leaves the throne (Rev. 14:14). If Christ will come to the air before the tribulation, then we do not need to wait, be sober, and be watchful.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_102.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_104.html">Next</a> </body></html>
