   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD SAVING US WITH A PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, is our salvation an accident or a purposeful act of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is God's salvation like giving two pennies to a beggar that one happens to come across in the street?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Or is God purposefully seeking to find a man to whom He can give money?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is God's salvation an accident, or is it according to a definite plan?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who do not understand salvation may think that God's salvation is an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But all those who understand the Bible and who know God realize that His salvation is not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, it was planned long ago according to a definite plan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8:29 says, "Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 30, a parenthetical word, says, "And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The salvation that we are talking about involves all the things covered in verses 29 and 30.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The history of our salvation began with justification in verse 30.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were saved at the time that we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only know that we have believed in Jesus and that we have been saved and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We think that justification is our first encounter with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We think that the first time we touched God in our life was when we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Bible says that God touched us long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He knew us long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our justification came afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's knowledge of us came first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some have said that Romans 8:29-30 is the only chain in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a chain of different rings linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a most precious and complete chain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first ring of this chain is God's foreknowledge of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second ring is our predestination to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The third ring is the calling of those who have been predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fourth ring is the justification of those who have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fifth ring is the glorification of those who have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a series of rings linked to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We think that we first knew God when we were saved and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Bible says that before we were saved and justified, God knew us already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those whom God knew long ago, He marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be marked out means to have a check mark put by our name, indicating that He has claimed us for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For what purpose were we marked out?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is so that we would be like His unique Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He not only wants one Son, Jesus Christ; He came to mark us out so that we would be identical to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who were marked out are called.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ones who are called are known by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He called the ones whom He knew and marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After He called them, He justified them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If justification is the first step in a Christian's relationship with God, it does not matter much for us not to be justified again in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I pick up two pennies today and throw them into the fire tomorrow, it does not matter much to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not to be justified is, of course, a loss on man's part.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God suffers no loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we have to know that the history of our relationship with God does not start from justification and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it starts from God's foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's foreknowledge is the beginning of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be marked out is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be called is the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only after the third step do we have justification.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we were to lose our justification and become sinners again, we would put a question mark on God's omniscience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since God foreknew us and marked us out, how can we still perish after we are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person predestinated by God can never be thrown into hell and burned like a piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a simple thing for us to make a decision because we change so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One minute we can be in heaven, and the next minute we can be in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may change once a day for the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But since God is God, His foreknowledge and predestination cannot be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The God whom we know and whom we worship cannot change what He has decided.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because He has the foreknowledge, the predestination, and the calling, our justification is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a small thing for us to lose our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it is a great thing for God to lose His foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For us to lose our justification does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But for God to make a mistake in foreknowing and calling us is a serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God cannot annul justification without affecting His foreknowledge, predestination, and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you take away one ring, the other three rings will not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever our salvation is lost, God's foreknowledge, predestination, and calling are all negated.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In addition, there is another item.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord says, "Those whom He justified, these He also glorified" v. 30 . Unless God brings those whom He justified into glory, His work is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we cannot get into the new heaven and the new earth, and if we cannot enter into eternal glory, God's work is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The last ring of God's work is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Until we are in glory, God's work is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What are we going to do with it?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We cannot set it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God says that those whom He justified will enter into glory unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He does not say that those who are justified will enter into glory if they have good works.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He does not say that only those whose works are approved can enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Neither does God say that those whom He justified must also be considered saved by man before they can enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There are no such conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All of the things that are mentioned here are related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is God who foreknew.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is God who predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is God who destined us to be like His Son and to be conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is God who has called us and justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is God who will bring us, the justified ones, into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is also God who will bring us into the new heaven and the new earth to inherit the eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Which of the rings is the greatest in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some say that glory is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Others say that foreknowledge is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Actually, there is no difference between them; every one is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We cannot say one is greater than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As many as God foreknew, that many are marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As many as are marked out, that many are called.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As many as are called, that many are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As many as are justified, that many will enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Can God foreknow that one hundred will be saved, but mark out only ninety, call only eighty, justify fifty, and merely bring ten into glory?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is impossible to mark out many and call a few.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Please remember that the words "those whom" in these verses convey this meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>"Those whom" He foreknew, these He also predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>"Those whom" He predestinated, these He also called.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>"Those whom" He called, these He also justified.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>"Those whom" He justified, these He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>These "those whoms" join the five rings together.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In the original language, the word "these" means "these people."</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>So, those whom He foreknew, "these people" He also marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Those whom He marked out, "these people" He also called.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Those whom He called, "these people" He also justified.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Those whom He justified, "these people" He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We cannot be short of any one item.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>These are all works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If they were our works, we could get some saved by mistake because we do not know which ones should be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>But if they are God's works, there can be no mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we do not know God and His works, we may still think that there is the possibility of losing some people.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But if we know God and His works, we will realize that no one can be subtracted or added.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The Bible says that God is eternal; He is not like us, having a beginning without an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>God says that He is the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega Rev 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He says that He is the beginning and the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We sometimes have a beginning without an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>At other times we have a good ending, but we do not know how to have a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>But God is both the beginning and the end. God's work cannot stop halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If salvation is only the result of our work, then failing in regard to the matter of salvation only means that we have stopped halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But we know that salvation is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It is God who has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Hence, if we cannot be saved to the uttermost, this does not mean that we have stopped halfway; it means that God has stopped halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Certainly, we can never imagine that God can stop halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Philippians 1:6 says that God has begun a good work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Since God has started it and has given us salvation Himself, He must complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We must remember that the work of God never stops halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He will complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus, that is, until God glorifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We can see how far-reaching is God's Word, how wide its scope, how long it lasts, and how deep its roots.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Verse 6 says, "Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Either God will not start, or He will have to finish what He has started.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If God was not willing to save us, that would be the end of the story.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>But if God's desire is to save us, there will be no way for us not to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Therefore, we can say, "God, we thank and praise You, because our salvation is eternally secure."</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If it were up to us to follow up, we would fail.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>The work of following up is accomplished by Him; the work of preservation is also accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We can never follow up what He has started.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>When I was in school, I had to practice Chinese calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Many times I was too lazy to do it, so I asked some classmates who were good at it to do it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Of course, later I made confession of this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Every week we had to submit five pages of calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>All of them were done by my classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>On one occasion after my classmate had finished one line of calligraphy, he was called away.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>He told me that he was busy and that I should finish what he had started.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>When I picked up the brush, I realized that I could never follow up on what he had started.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>His calligraphy was so fine that my characters simply could not match his.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>In the same way, the work of salvation was started by God.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>He must be the One to conclude it.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If we had to conclude it, we would never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>If the work of salvation began with God and was followed up by us, none of us would be qualified to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>All those who want to follow up do not know God and do not know themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>If we know Him, we will realize that there is no way for us to finish whatever He has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>And if we really know ourselves, we will realize that we simply cannot follow up.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The entire work of salvation is accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>He has given us salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>He will save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>We do nothing to preserve our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Hence, we see two things here.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>First, because the nature of God's salvation is grace, it is impossible for us to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Second, since it is God who has started the work, who has foreknown and predestinated us, who has called and justified us, who has saved us, and who will bring us into glory, God's attribute would be put into question if we lost our salvation.</S>
