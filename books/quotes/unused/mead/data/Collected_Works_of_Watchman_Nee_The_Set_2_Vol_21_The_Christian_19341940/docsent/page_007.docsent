   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Friends, I am not asking how you are doing in your homes.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may be a good son at home.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am not asking if you get along well with your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may not have fought and gone to court with your brothers over your inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am not asking about your relationship with your colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They may honor and respect you very much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am not asking if you are a good citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may be very faithful to your country, pay your tax faithfully, obey your government, and may have never engaged in any kind of activity that overturns the government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I have to ask you one thing: can you say that there is no problem between you and God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is your relationship with God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is not asking about your relationship with your wife, brother, and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not asking if you have murdered anyone or if you have committed arson.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is asking about your relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may have handled many problems with the world properly, but if your relationship with God is not proper, there is still one problem that is unsolved, and you are still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible has clear teachings concerning this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How did sin enter the world?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sin entered the world not through murder nor through someone calling his wife his sister nor through someone usurping another's wife and sending the husband to be killed in the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sin entered the world simply by the eating of a piece of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin did not enter the first time through prostitution, gambling, pride, jealousy, murder, or arson.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin entered the world through man eating one fruit that he should not have eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God said to Adam, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will not go into the reason the Lord said this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will only point out the fact that man overturned God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God commanded that he not eat of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This meant that he should not eat of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet he ate what God had commanded him not to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result was frustration for God and opposition against God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once Adam ate of the fruit, he hid himself among the trees in the garden; he took up a position that was hidden from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin is having a wrong relationship with God; it is standing in an improper position in relation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was sin for Cain to murder Abel, but sin was already present before he murdered his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God did not reject Cain because he killed his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Cain was offering the produce of the land, God was not pleased with him; He was already shaking His head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Cain was rejected because his relationship with God was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He wanted to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He would be what we commonly call a religious man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He worked hard to offer the produce of the field to God in order to try to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But sin was already in the world, and he should have stood on the ground of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he did not stand on the ground of the blood, he could not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His position was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many of us are familiar with the story of the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What sin did the prodigal son commit?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some have said that the prodigal son wasted his father's possessions; he squandered and wasted all that he was given and became a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I have to tell you that the first day he took his father's possessions, while he was yet rich, he was already a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not become a prodigal son after he became destitute.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The minute he left his father, he became a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The day he left his father's house, he was a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he journeyed to a far land, he was a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not become a prodigal son after he failed, spent all his money, and was feeding the pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as he left his father, he was a prodigal son whether or not he still had money.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He became a prodigal son due to one mistake and one mistake only: his departure from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Had he made a fortune and doubled his wealth from five thousand to ten thousand, his father could not have said to him: "Well done, you good and faithful son."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if he had struck a fortune, he was still a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The question is not whether the prodigal son was destitute, feeding the pigs, or hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The question is whether or not there was a problem between him and his father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as he was in a far country, he was a prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the prodigal son came to himself, he did not resolve to be more diligent, save more money, or turn back from rags to become rich again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When he came to himself, what did he say?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said, "I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you" Luke 15:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did not go back for food because he was hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not go back for shoes because he was without shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He did not go back for clothing because he did not have anything to wear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said, "I will rise up and go to my father."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Being saved is having a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Having eternal life is having a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>John 17:3 says, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there was no problem between the prodigal son and his father, he would not have left even if the father had driven him away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who leave their homes are prodigal sons; those who leave their fathers are prodigal sons.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the prodigal son returned, in the eyes of the father, the son who was dead, was now alive; the son who was lost, was now found.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not sinners because we have committed many different miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are sinners because we cannot face God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am not saying that the many miscellaneous sins are not sins.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am saying that the unique sin is being wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul shows us clearly in the first three chapters of Romans what the qualifications of a sinner are.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He shows us the kind of sin we need to commit before we can be called a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In other words, he tells us the way to be accredited a sinner, or the way to have the title of a sinner conferred upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Romans 1 through 3 shows us that the one sin a sinner commits is being wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In chapter one, there are three references to the fact that God "gave them up."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us consider these instances one by one.</S>
