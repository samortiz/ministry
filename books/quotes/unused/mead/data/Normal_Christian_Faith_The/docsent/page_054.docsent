   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO ADAMS, TWO MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because the Bible regards the whole of humanity as two men, we will not be surprised if we read 1 Corinthians 15:45 and 47: "So also it is written, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit....The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible identifies the first man as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It also identifies Christ as another Adam, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that there will not be a third Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are only two Adams.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How does the Bible count?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It counts Adam as the first man and Christ as the second.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From Adam to Christ millions of men were born.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Bible does not count them as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam was first.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is second.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, everyone that came out of Adam is included in him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are all associated with sin; they are all sinful, and they are all earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, those who receive life from the last Adam are included in Christ, having all of Jesus' experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin has no power over them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AGAIN RELATED TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once again we see that every doctrine we have is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every experience that a Christian will encounter is bound up with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All that the Bible asks of us is to believe in Him, listen to Him, obey Him, and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The solution to all problems hinges on Him and is found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All we need to do is have Christ Jesus as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His experiences will become our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the center of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we are attached to Him, everything will be set right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam is a corporate man, including you and me and everyone inside him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His experiences in the garden of Eden have become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His end has become our fate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same manner Christ is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone in Christ has the same relationship with Him as they formerly had with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every experience of Christ becomes the experience of those in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The whole of humanity is bound up within these two men and intimately related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE RELATIONSHIP THE TWO MEN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>HAVE WITH HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we want to examine the crucial relationship the two men have with the whole of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 5:12: "Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men because all have sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 14: "But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From Adam to Moses, there were approximately two thousand five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Countless numbers of persons were born, and innumerable kinds of sins were committed during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet, according to God's reckoning, sin entered the whole human race through one man, Adam, who was the prefigure of Him who was to come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was a miniature of the coming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you see Adam, you will know how Christ is.</S>
