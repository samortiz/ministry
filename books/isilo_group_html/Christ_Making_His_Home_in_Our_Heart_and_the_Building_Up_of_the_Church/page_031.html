<h1 class="title">THE WAY OF FAITH&mdash;<br />
LOOKING AWAY UNTO JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:32-39; 11:1&mdash;12:3</h1>
<p>Hebrews 10:38-39 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him.&rsquo; But we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul.&rdquo; Chapter 11 speaks of what faith is and the history of faith, showing that many people in the Old Testament lived and walked by faith.</p>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 12 say, &ldquo;Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us, looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith.&rdquo; In the Chinese Union Version the phrase <em>looking away unto</em> is translated as &ldquo;looking to&rdquo;; however, <em>looking to</em> is inadequate. The phrase <em>looking away unto</em> means to look at what is ahead with undivided attention so that one is separated from all objects that surround him. By looking away unto the Lord Jesus with undivided attention, we are separated from everything in our present and in our past.</p>
<p>The second half of verse 2 and verse 3 say, &ldquo;Who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo; The word <em>fainting</em> literally means &ldquo;becoming loosened.&rdquo; Both &ldquo;fainting in your souls&rdquo; and &ldquo;who have faith to the gaining of the soul&rdquo; in 10:39 are related to the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN WAY BEING THE WAY OF FAITH</h2>
<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews is probably the only book in the New Testament that speaks of how we follow the Lord on His pathway. Although 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, Philippians 3:13-14, and 2 Timothy 4:7-8 cover the matter of running the course, they stress being regulated, being faithful, and running for the prize. They do not speak concerning the source of our motivation in following the Lord or of our pathway before the Lord. Only Hebrews shows the pathway and the source of our motivation in following the Lord.</p>
<p>The root of the word <em>Hebrew</em> means &ldquo;to pass over,&rdquo; specifically to pass over a river; that is, to pass over from one side of a river to the other side. After traveling on a long journey, a person passes from one side to another. This is the meaning of the word <em>Hebrew.</em> Hence, in the book of Hebrews all those who have been called by God to follow the Lord are to take the way of river crossing. They are to cross from one side to another. We need to cross over from earthly things to the heavenly things, from the temporal to the eternal, from the Old Testament to the New Testament, and from the things outside of the Son of God to the things in the Son of God. Furthermore, we need to cross over from ourselves to God. These items are included in Hebrews.</p>
<p>This book focuses on our crossing over from the things of the present to the things in the future. Hence, the way of river crossing is the way of faith. Whenever there is a problem with our faith, we immediately encounter difficulties. This way of faith is not referred to in 1 Corinthians, Philippians, or 2 Timothy, even though they speak of running the race. Only Hebrews speaks of the way of faith. Furthermore, according to Hebrews the motivating power for Christians to take the way of faith lies in the Lord Jesus Christ. The motivating power for us to take the way of faith lies in our knowledge of Him.</p>
<p>Hebrews first presents the superiority of Christ, the Son of God. Then in chapter 11 it presents the way of faith. The first part of the Epistle gives us the knowledge of the Son of God, and the second part, the way of faith. The way that we take is the way of faith, and the motivating power for us to take this way is our knowledge of the Son of God. The extent to which we know the Lord is the extent to which we will be motivated. Our motivating power depends entirely on our knowledge of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the end of Hebrews the author connects our faith to our knowledge of the Son of God. On the one hand, our way is the way of faith; on the other hand, the motivation for us to take this way depends on our knowledge and revelation of the Son of God. Hence, the Son of God should always be set before us. Our mind and our emotion should be occupied with Him, and what we gaze at, observe, and look away to should be the Lord. He is the attraction and the motivation. He attracts us to walk the way that is set before us, and He motivates us to walk this way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
