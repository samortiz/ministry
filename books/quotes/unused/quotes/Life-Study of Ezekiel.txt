Our goal is not to research this book or to expound it but to see the visions of God's glorious life contained in it
Although the entire Bible tells this mysterious story of God and man, two books are concerned with this story in a particular way
In the entire Bible the books that speak most clearly concerning God flowing out as life are Ezekiel and Revelation
In Revelation 22:1 and 2 we see the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
Not only are the books of Ezekiel and Revelation similar in content, but the authors of these books are similar in certain respects
Now man, under and through Christ's redemption, has free access to the tree of life and may take the tree of life as his food
Eventually, chapter forty-eight reveals that we who have God's life will be built up together into the holy city, Jerusalem
By the divine nature with the divine image we will be built together as one eternal dwelling place-the New Jerusalem
The fourth section , which concerns the holy building of God, comes out of the recovery by life and consummates the book
Regarding the introduction to Ezekiel, the first thing we need to consider is the date, with the year, the month, and the day
According to Numbers 4:2-3 and 1 Chronicles 23:3 a priest, a Levite, started to serve the Lord at the age of thirty
We have the principle that to realize spiritual things and to see heavenly visions, we need the maturity in life
Christians today have difficulty understanding this book because most of them lack the maturity in the divine life
Spiritually speaking not many Christians have reached the age of thirty and thus it is hard for them to understand the visions in this book
In Ezekiel 40 through 48, the portion of this book that is devoted to God's building, the number thirty is used for three kinds of things
These four corner courts are the places for the priests to prepare the offerings for the people to eat and enjoy
The number thirty was not only significant for Ezekiel but is also significant for us as believers in Christ today
In the book of Ezekiel the number thirty is formed in two ways: five multiplied by six and three multiplied by ten
In the Bible the number ten, which is the complete number of a man, is composed of two fives, of five times two
With the Ten Commandments, there were five commandments on one tablet and another five commandments on a second tablet
The number ten, composed of two fives, signifies that as creatures we have God added to us so that we may be able to bear responsibility
Thirty is therefore an important number signifying man with the Triune God in him bearing responsibility in a complete way
Whereas the thirtieth year was counted from the year of his birth, the fifth year was counted from the year of captivity
The visions did not come earlier because the people were not ready and Ezekiel himself, being under the age of thirty, also was not ready
Due to the lack of maturity, some among us cannot see the visions which the Lord intends to show us from this book
We need to look to the Lord that He would grant us the maturity in life that we may see accept receive and take in all the spiritual things
The fact that the visions came in the fifth year indicates that not only Ezekiel but also the people had been made ready
Even though Gods people were in captivity they still had some grace from God so when the time came they could bear responsibility before God
The 'fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity' indicates that the time had come for the people of Israel to bear responsibility toward God
On the other hand, the people could now bear their responsibility, and God came in to speak to them concerning it
Before a child's parents can speak to him about a particular responsibility, the child must be the proper age to receive such a speaking
We cannot speak concerning the things in the book of Ezekiel to those who have just been saved, for they cannot understand them
In this message we will continue to consider Ezekiel 1:1-3, three verses which are the introduction to this book
Verse 3 tells us that the visions came to Ezekiel when he was 'in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar'
The very place where Ezekiel saw the visions was the place where Satan instigated the greatest rebellion against God among the fallen people
There are two rivers in the book of Ezekiel: the river Chebar in chapter one and the river flowing out of the temple in chapter forty-seven
The river Chebar carries the people of God away from God, but the river flowing out of the temple brings people into God's life
Many of the people of Israel had been killed by the Babylonian army; others had died because of famine, disease, and wild animals
The situation was not totally hopeless, for God still left some 'dry land' by the river which had carried His people away
If they had not been by the banks of the river Chebar but instead had been in the river, they all would have perished
As a captive in the land of captivity, Ezekiel was tested and surely must have felt perplexed, distressed, and depressed
Because Ezekiel was such a person and contacted God in such a way, the heavens were opened to him, and he 'saw visions of God'
When we read the book of Ezekiel, we see that in fulfilling his ministry as a prophet, he was constantly disgraced and put to shame
God required him to perform certain demonstrations, and in these demonstrations he became a prophet in disgrace
God also told him to dig through the wall of the city and carry out his stuff through the wall, and Ezekiel did as he was commanded
Because God's captive people are in disgrace, God's ministers will also be in disgrace as they minister God's words
In the land of captivity there was a man, Ezekiel, who was mature and who was one with God, and the heavens were opened to him
We need the heavens to be opened to us, but in order for the heavens to be opened in our experience, we need to be Ezekiels
The first time the Bible mentions the heavens being opened was when Jacob was wandering in his attempt to escape his brother Esau
When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the heavens were opened to declare that there was a man on earth who was one with God in the heavens
The people of Israel had been damaged by Satan and carried away into captivity, and, as a result, the heavens could not be opened to them
Among those in captivity, there was a priest who was seeking God and contacting Him and who was connected to the heavens
Today the earth is still occupied by Satan; the people on earth are still in Satan's hands; and most of God's people are still in captivity
There is an urgent need for some, like Ezekiel, who will seek God, contact God, and be God's priests ministering before God
Not only were the heavens opened to Ezekiel, but the visions came, and something was revealed, unveiled, to him
Because God wanted Ezekiel not only to behold with his eyes but also to hear with his ears , He gave him words along with His visions
The words given to Ezekiel, being special, fresh, and vivid, are different from the words given to Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah
The words in Ezekiel are God's special words, which came in a particular way to a man who was in close contact with God
For such an express word, do not go to the expositions of the Bible, and do not go even to the books of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee
Those who are ministers of God's words need God to give them not only visions but also special words, fresh words
If you minister many things and nothing happens, this means that you have a babbling mouth, but God's hand is not working
If we speak and the divine hand does not follow, then our speaking is a vain babbling, and others should not pay attention to it
The one who speaks God's express word may be an insignificant person, but God's hand is not an insignificant matter
After the Lord's hand came upon Ezekiel, everything he did was due to the leading and directing of the Lord's hand
Wherever he went, whatever he did, and how he acted and behaved were all due to God's leading and directing hand
We see that a man who speaks for God no longer has his own freedom and can no longer do things according to his own convenience
Where he goes and what he does are not according to his choice but are under and according to the leading and directing hand of God
May we all have an open heaven, see God's visions, receive God's words, and have God's leading and directing hand upon us
The degree of our knowing God will determine both the degree of our spiritual experience and the situation of the church
Spiritually speaking, everything we have depends on God's being, vision, and manifestation and on our knowing God
The visions, which begin from the north, where God is, show us God in His will, plan, intention, work, action, and relationship with man
Without the pictures in the Bible, it would be rather difficult for us to understand God and the spiritual things
Just as the Bible as a whole is a picture book, so Ezekiel as a miniature of the Bible is also a picture book, a book full of pictures
the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot,' and 'they had the hands of a man under their wings'
The answer to this question is found in Psalm 75:6-7a: 'For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south
On the day of Pentecost there was a rushing, mighty wind which filled the house where the one hundred twenty were sitting
If you have never had such experiences, you need to look to the Lord and pray for His wind from the north to blow upon you
By considering the history of the people of Israel, we can understand more fully the significance of the cloud
Later, after the tent of meeting was set up for God, God's glory filled the tent and a cloud covered it and abode upon it
Together, the wind and the cloud are an indication that an important transaction is about to take place between God and man
At least from time to time, in our Christian life there needs to be a significant spiritual transaction between God and us
The Holy Spirit touches us and moves us, causing us to turn to the Lord, to see our corruption, and to repent and confess our sins
The blowing of the wind brings the presence of God to us in the form of a heavenly, brooding, overshadowing cloud
When you pray, repenting and confessing your sins, you may sense that you are under the covering of a canopy or of a cloud
Under such a shining, enlightening, searching, and burning, we may realize that we are wrong in certain things
Under the shining and searching of the Lord's presence, we are exposed, and we condemn ourselves and confess our shortcomings
We all need the blowing of the wind, the overshadowing of the Lord's presence, and the searching and burning of this fire
What is His purpose in blowing upon us as the wind, in covering us as the cloud, and in consuming us as the fire?
These illustrations from Revelation 22 and 4 help us to understand the significance of the electrum in Ezekiel
Our God is not merely the divine Being signified by the gold; He is also the redeeming God, signified by the silver
When we experience the blowing wind, we enjoy the covering cloud and then we pass through the burning, consuming fire
In the sight of God, before we were saved, we were base and wicked, having nothing that was honorable or glorious
His wind, His cloud, and His burning fire have made it possible for us to have Him, the redeeming God, within us as the glowing electrum
Now we have Him as the treasure in the earthen vessel , and we have thereby become a people of honor and glory
We all need to experience more of the spiritual wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum
Whenever we meet together, we are the vision of the glory of the electrum, having a precious treasure that is shining and glowing
There has been a continual experience of the blowing wind, the covering cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum
My burden is to point out that the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum should be a Christian's spiritual life story
Throughout our whole Christian life, our spiritual experiences should be a continual cycle involving these four matters
If a person has never experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, that person surely is not a normal Christian
As a result, you were awakened and began to wonder about the meaning of human life and, in particular, about the significance of your life
The wind kept blowing upon you and within you until you believed into the Lord and received His full salvation
A spiritual wind not only blew upon us when we were saved but also blows every time we have a spiritual revival
A particular believer may be quite careless regarding his spiritual life and yet be quite content with his spiritual condition
If such a believer is in a good mood, he may read the Bible and pray, but if he is in a bad mood, he may neglect prayer and Bible reading
He will become restless and quite concerned about his situation and begin to ask questions concerning the condition of his spiritual life
Such a burning exposes our condition and causes us to confess our transgressions and deal with ourselves before God
Have you not experienced the wind blowing upon you, the cloud covering you, and the fire burning and purifying you?
Before you experienced the Spirit's blowing and burning, you might have felt that others were always at fault and that you were always right
When we are under the blowing of the wind, the covering of the cloud, and the burning of the fire, we will not feel that we are all right
After we have been burned by God as the consuming fire, we sense that we are filled with God's nature and glory
Once we have experienced the wind, the cloud, and the fire, the only thing that remains is the glowing electrum, the redeeming God
When we were saved, we experienced the Lord in these four ways, and we should continue to experience Him in this way
Every time we are graced by the Lord, we have spiritual transactions with Him involving the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum
When you wake up in the morning, you may sense that the wind of the Spirit is blowing upon you and that a cloud is overshadowing you
Eventually, you may sense that within you there is something bright, beautiful, and dignified-the glowing electrum
You confess your sins and deal with your filthiness, and following this you once again enjoy the shining of the electrum within you
Day after day week after week month after month and year after year we need to experience the wind the cloud the fire and the electrum
As these negative things are burned away, we experience a further purification and have a deeper enjoyment of the glowing electrum
The wind does not blow, the cloud does not cover, the fire does not burn, and thus there is no manifestation of the electrum
If a believer wants to be graced by the Lord, he must experience the spiritual wind and the spiritual cloud-the more, the better
As we are under the brooding, covering cloud of the Lord's presence, we spontaneously realize how sinful and impure we are
Like Augustine, you may eventually feel that even your confession and tears of repentance need the Lord's cleansing
The issue of the blowing of the wind, the covering of the cloud, and the burning of the fire is the radiant manifestation of the electrum
The more we pass through God's wind, cloud, and fire, the more the Lord is manifested in us in a dignified and glorious way
When He is manifested in such a way, we sense that He alone is precious, lovely, bright, majestic, and glorious
We can do nothing other than bow before Him, worship Him, exalt Him, crown Him, and pour out everything to Him
We have considered four of these figures-the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum-which depict what God is to us
The wind brings in the cloud; the cloud enfolds the fire; and the fire produces the electrum plus something else-the four living creatures
When we experience God as the blowing wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the electrum, we become the four living creatures
The word living in Hebrew has the same root as the word for life in Genesis 2:9, which speaks of the tree of life
Through the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, we, who were dead, were enlivened to become living creatures
Now we should daily experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum so that we may become living and vibrant in our inner being
Some children of God may behave very badly, putting the name of the Lord to shame, yet they have no feeling about what they are doing
Every time we meet the Lord as the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, our inner being will be made alive
Many verses in the Bible indicate that the number four is related to God's creation and signifies man as God's creature
Revelation 5:9 says that the Lord has redeemed us out of four sources: out of every tribe, tongue, people, and nation
As such an expression, they express this man not only in one direction but in the four directions of east, north, south, and west
Verse 26 says that 'upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it'
In our reading of the four Gospels we may be under the influence of a religious concept that places undue emphasis upon Christ's divinity
If we know how to read the Gospels in a proper way, we will realize that the glorious beauty of the Lord Jesus is manifested in His humanity
He manifested His glorious beauty not through His divine dignity but through His humanity with its lowliness and tenderness
He even became a man in order to declare God , and today in the heavens the Lord Jesus, who is God, is still a man
We may talk about the church as the expression of Christ, but we may not realize what the expression of Christ is
God's redemption and God's salvation are to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to being a proper man
The vision in Ezekiel 1 reveals three crucial matters concerning the four living creatures' bearing the appearance of a man
For this we need to be the living creatures enlivened by experiencing the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum
After they went away to buy food, a Samaritan woman came to draw water from the well near which the Lord Jesus was sitting
The woman questioned Him, saying, 'How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman'?
The four Gospels record many similar stories which show us how the Lord Jesus behaved Himself like a normal man, bearing the face of a man
Unlike certain religious people today who dress in way that is very strange, the Lord Jesus did not dress in a peculiar manner
Some believers have the thought that once they begin to pursue the Lord, they should be special or different from others
We need to realize, therefore, that we should be ordinary, that is, we should be the same as common, ordinary human beings
We experience the Lord as the wind the cloud the fire and the electrum but the issue of this experience is that we bear the face of a man
In the Epistles we are taught by the apostles to be proper human beings, in particular how to be proper husbands, wives, and parents
All those who work in your office should know that if they talk to you about worldly things, you will behave like a lion
We, who have become living creatures through regeneration, should not only be men to manifest God but also lions to reign for God
If toward sin, the world, and Satan we are strong and bold like lions, God will be able to establish His reign through us
In order to make such an impression, you need to behave not only like a man and like a lion but also like a serving, suffering ox
In this way you will show your colleagues that you are willing to sacrifice, to help others, and to serve them
When others see you with the face of a man, the face of a lion, and the face of an ox, they will say, 'This is a real Christian'
A Christian has God's life within him, and this life is transcendent, causing us to have an expression of buoyancy and transcendence
These four faces-the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle-portray the life of Christ
As Christians, we should be the living creatures, those who are a corporate entity to express Christ exactly as He was on earth
Consider for example the four faces of the living creatures the face of a man the face of a lion the face of an ox and the face of an eagle
Surely the wings are the wings of an eagle because among the creatures represented by the four faces, only the eagle has the wings
Verse 7 speaks of the calf's hoofs: 'Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot'
According to the pure Word it is easy to see the spiritual significance of the eagle's wings, the man's hand, and the calf's feet
In the New Testament the eagle's wings are the grace, the power, and the strength of God in Christ applied to us
Corinthians 4:7 says, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
In our experience of the Lord, the power of Christ may overshadow us, even as the eagle's wings overshadow the covered ones
From these verses we can see that the eagle's wings signify the strength and the grace of the Lord Jesus applied to us
Psalm 57:1 speaks of making our refuge in the shadow of God's wings, and 63:7 speaks of rejoicing in the shadow of His wings
On the one hand, the Lord's grace is the power for us to move; on the other hand, the Lord's power is our protection, our hiding place
We are under the overshadowing of the grace and the power of Christ, and we are under the covering of His power
They should realize that we are normal, yet there is something empowering, strengthening, overshadowing, and covering us
Two of his wings are stretched forth to join to the other living creatures, and two of his wings are wrapped around his body for a cover
Those who work with such a person might say He can suffer the things we cannot suffer and he can bear a responsibility that we cannot bear
We have the four wings of an eagle, giving others the impression that we have God with us as our power and protection
He could say that he conducted himself not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God and that the grace of God with him was not in vain
Sometimes the young people may imagine that because they are seeking the Lord, there is no need for them to study hard
Young people, no matter how much you seek the Lord, love the Lord, and care for the Lord, you still need to be diligent in your studies
We need to have both the wings of the Lord's empowering grace and the hands of a man, cooperating with God in a human way
In contrast, in everything we do we should be under the Lord's grace and power, depending on Him and expressing Him
Let us now go on to consider the calf's hoofs, a matter of particular importance in the vision recorded in Ezekiel 1
While we can apply the boldness of a lion to our Christian character, we should not apply the lion's paws to the Christian walk
During the last days before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He went to Jerusalem and was surrounded by the leaders of religion and politics
On one occasion the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and asked By what authority do You do these things
They reasoned among themselves, saying, 'If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
If we read the four Gospels, we will see that while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He walked in a very straight way
Not only the Lord Jesus was straight in His walk, but also the apostle Paul was very straight, frank, faithful, and honest in his walk
Clean animals such as the cow and sheep have two characteristics: the chewing of the cud and the dividing of the hoof
As believers in Christ, we need to have such a walk that we can discern what is right and what is wrong in the eyes of God
We need to be able to discern whether a particular group of believers is in fact a normal, proper, genuine local church
We should not be careless, thinking that simply because a group says that they are a local church, they must indeed be a local church
If our walk has been tested in this way, it will be like shining brass, enlightening others and becoming a kind of shining to them
If we are careless and sloppy, lacking discernment concerning the church life, to us everything will be about the same
A believer in Christ who enjoys grace and lives in the presence of God is always new and fresh, and with him there is no oldness
Sometimes you may meet a brother who is quite young humanly but spiritually is rather old, lacking in freshness and newness
It is by having this kind of life and walk that we, the living creatures, can be coordinated and become one entity
We need a life that has the wings of an eagle and the hands of a man, and we need a walk that has the straight hoofs of a calf
In this message we will begin to consider the coordination of the four living creatures described in this portion of Ezekiel 1
We have also seen that in the Old Testament the eagle's wings signify the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply
In themselves the living creatures are separate and are individuals, but with the eagle's wings they are coordinated as one body
The throne upon which the Lord is, the throne which is for God's administration, is in the center of this coordination
The coordination of the living creatures is for the Lord's expression and manifestation, for the Lord's move, and for the divine government
As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures' wings, forming a square
Ezekiel 1:12 says, 'And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went'
Once they are coordinated, there is a kind of suffering, because in coordination there is no freedom or convenience
If someone acts without coordination in the church service, doing things on his own, he will make a number of turns
If he functions in the way of doing many different things by himself, it will be necessary for him to make many turns
In the church life we all need to learn not only how to walk straight forward but also how to walk backward and to walk sideways
If we would have coordination in the church life, we all need to learn to walk straight forward, to walk backward, and to walk sideways
If in a local church one brother has a ministry to preach the gospel and another has a ministry to build up the saints, they must coordinate
If there were only one ministry-the ministry of preaching the gospel of building up the saints-there would be little or no problem
If brothers with different ministries do not know how to coordinate, they will compete and may even strive against each other
The brother who is burdened for the gospel may contend for the outreach and the increase, and he may try to convince others to join him
The problem is that neither those who like to shout nor those who prefer to be quiet may be willing to walk backward
While one brother is walking straight forward according to his burden, you should say 'Amen' and walk backward in coordination with him
The problem today is that in the churches there are too many turns and too little of the backward walk and the sideways walk
He does a good job in this matter, but he is constantly searching for capable ones to join him in this service
He cares only for this service and neither for the preaching of the gospel nor for the building up of the saints
From this we can see that it is easy for us to cause a division, but it is difficult for us to have the proper and real coordination
We also need to learn to walk backward and sideways, saying 'Amen' to another's position, function, and ministry
The more we grow, learn, function, and minister, the more trouble we will cause because we know only how to walk forward and to have turns
If you are the one who is walking straight forward, you must be very careful to walk according to the leading of the Spirit
If the one who is walking straight forward is not careful to follow the leading of the Spirit, the coordination will be damaged
There must be the leading of the Spirit concerning the time for preaching the gospel and the time for shepherding
We all need to bear the likeness of living creatures, the likeness of a man, and the likeness of burning coals and burning torches
From the proper coordination in a local church, there will not only be burning but also enlightening and shining
If we do not allow the sanctifying fire to burn us in a certain matter, we will not be enlightened regarding this matter
Among the coordinated living creatures, who are burning coals and burning torches, there is the fire going up and down
Whenever the church is properly coordinated, burning as coals and enlightening as torches, there will be the divine fire going up and down
The fact that the fire was bright indicates that the living creatures manifested a glorious and majestic condition
The more we are burned and enlightened, the more others will see the brightness of God's glory, beauty, and majesty
Whereas the brightness is usual, the flashing of lightning is special, as it is often related to storms and darkness
Since the coordination is for the move and the move is in the coordination, with such a coordination there is the move of a local church
It is crucial for us to realize that Ezekiel 1 shows us the desire of God's heart and unveils to us the purpose that God wants to accomplish
When God has His expression, move, and administration, He can manifest Himself in His glory and complete His eternal purpose and plan
We also have the calf's hoofs and thereby have a walk that is full of discernment, enlightening, and freshness
No matter what our race or nationality may be, we all are out of Christ and we can coordinate together as one entity in Christ
Although in Adam we have many differences, in Christ we can be blended together and we can coordinate together
If we reject everything that is not Christ, we will be one entity in Christ and we will be able to coordinate together
Deep within many believers, including those who have fallen away from Him, is the desire to express Christ and glorify Him
For the corporate expression of Christ, we need to be joined together, knit together, and coordinated together
Through our experience in serving the Lord, we have learned that coordination is necessary for every aspect of God's move
Suppose a certain person has not passed through the experience of the wind the cloud the fire and the electrum yet he is a nominal Christian
Because he stays in himself and because he expresses himself in every word and action, it is impossible for him to coordinate with others
We should not think that it is easy for us to express, to live out, the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle
Of having the expression of an eagle in their daily living, some believers may have the expression of a creeping thing
Because they do not overcome their anger and do not let it go, they have the expression of a creeping thing, not of an eagle
Those who do not accept the dealing of the cross and enjoy grace are not able to share in the coordination of the four living creatures
There are some brothers and sisters who are reluctant to part with and forget such things as their education, money, and career
There is no need for them to endeavor to coordinate they coordinate spontaneously and effortlessly because they are in God not in themselves
Ezekiel 1:11b says, 'Their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies'
If the four living creatures were not joined together by the wings to form a square, they could not be coordinated
Our coordination, therefore, is not based on our ability and talent but on our dwelling in God and depending on God
If we all abide in God, trust in God, and express God, God will become the power and the means of our coordination
These verses reveal that we are joined together as one Body and coordinate as one Body because of Christ and the Spirit
If we walk in an arbitrary way according to self-will and if we live in the flesh, we cannot coordinate together
If one living creature takes the lead to move straight forward toward the east, the other living creatures also move in this direction
Regardless of the direction in which the living creatures move, one moves forward, one moves backward, and the others move sideways
If everyone goes his own way and does not accommodate others, we cannot be a corporate entity and we cannot coordinate together
If we would participate in such a coordination, we need to deny ourselves, experience God's grace, and follow the Spirit in a corporate way
If we study the clear picture of the coordination of the living creatures in Ezekiel 1, we will understand what coordination is
Without such a coordination, God would not have a means of ruling and He would not have the means to express His authority and His glory
Because of the coordination of the four living creatures, there is a way for God's will and God's plan to be carried out
The Lord on the throne looks like a man, and the four living creatures expressing the Lord also look like a man
In verses 15 through 21 the four living creatures are not only for the expression of the Lord but also for the move of the Lord
If there is no increase in number year after year and no growth in life among the members, there is no move with that church
If a church claims to have the move of the Lord, this may indicate that it does not actually have the Lord's move
Everyone can see the great wheel, high and dreadful, for it is at the side of the living creatures for all to see
These prophets and teachers were living creatures coordinating together and having the burning coals and the burning torches
You can suffer things which others cannot suffer and you can endure things which others cannot endure because you have the eagle's wings
They can also realize that in your character and behavior you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness
They will see the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs upon you, and thus they will be convicted by you in their conscience
In addition to this kind of move with you on your job, there should also be another kind of move-an extraordinary move, the move of a wheel
If there is no move of the Lord with you, it is questionable whether you have the eagle's wings, the man's hands, and the calf's hoofs
The presence of the wheel will prove that we are proper, that is, that we have the eagle's wings, the man's hands, and the calf's hoofs
We need to experience the blowing of the wind, the overshadowing of the Spirit, and the burning of the Spirit in order to gain much electrum
We need the calf's hoofs in order to walk in a straight and sincere way, in a way that convinces others and commends us to their conscience
By reading his Epistles and the book of Acts, we can realize that Paul regarded himself as less than the least of all saints
We should have the eagle's wings, the man's hands, and the calf's hoofs, and thereby have a great wheel for the Lord's move
If we apply this to our spiritual experience, we will realize that it is absolutely correct to say that the wheels are full of eyes
If your church has a high and dreadful wheel, a high and dreadful move, within that move there will be many eyes
If you mean business with the Lord for His move on earth today, you will be full of eyes, and thus you will have insight and foresight
He was clear about the present, the future, the world situation, the Word, the church, physical things, and spiritual things
The reason these Christians and these churches are blind is that with them there is no wheel, no move of the Lord
Do not be like a frog in a well-limited by your environment and able to see only what is directly above you in a very narrow way
When we speak of a wheel, we say that the circumference is the rim, that the center is the hub, and that in between are the spokes
If the churches do not move with the Lord, they have no way to go on because there is no wheel within the wheel
These verses tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament, or the expanse, which we call the sky
In a previous message we saw that two of the wings of each of the living creatures are stretched forth and joined to the wings of others
If we do not understand this spiritual significance and application, then to us these points may appear either nonsensical or meaningless
We first need to experience the blowing wind, which brings in the cloud of the Lord's presence to overshadow us
Following this we need to experience and enjoy the eagles wings that is we move by the divine power and strength and by the grace of Christ
We also cover ourselves, hiding ourselves under His overshadowing wings, hiding ourselves under the grace and power of Christ
There will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us, indicating that we have God's move on earth by us and with us
It is not just a matter of having a clear sky vertically, from heaven to earth, but also a matter of having a clear sky horizontally
All the clouds, coverings, separations, and fog will be gone, and we will have a sky that is thoroughly clear and continually expanding
They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically and also a clear fellowship among themselves horizontally
It is impossible for the living creatures to be narrow-minded, because there is a wide expanse above their heads
If we are under a clear and expanding sky, we can have the adequate and proper coordination, a coordination that is altogether straight
In verse 23 it is used for the eagle's wings: 'Under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other'
Brother B goes to brother C, passes on the information to him, and then asks him not to say anything about this to brother D
Before the day of Pentecost, Peter often voiced something by himself, and what he spoke was usually rejected by the Lord Jesus
The voice which came out on the day of Pentecost was not the voice of an individual Peter but the voice of a corporate body
On the one hand, the four living creatures stretched two of their wings for coordination, for moving, and for giving the voice
Others will be astonished at this kind of voice, and they will say that the voice of this local church is like the sound of great waters
Often the situation in the local churches is not like this, because the church does not have a clear, expanding, and stable heaven
We will have a voice like the sound of great waters and like that of the Almighty God and of an army fighting the battle for God's economy
There is another matter that we need to consider, and this is mentioned in verse 24b: 'When they stood, they let down their wings'
When they hear a voice not out of their wings but out of the clear sky above their heads, they stop and let down their wings
A proper local church knows both how to move and how to stop, how to sound forth its voice and how to listen to God's voice
There may be a one-man show, with one person doing everything and insisting that everything and everyone be under his control
We all, especially the leading ones in the local churches, need to see this picture and experience what is unveiled in it
These spiritual things are deep, but we can understand them through the natural and physical things that are used to describe them
When there is nothing between us and the Lord, our sky will be crystal clear, and our conscience will be pure, void of any offense
Whenever there is condemnation or an offense on our conscience, our sky immediately becomes cloudy, darkened, and foggy
At such times we should confess our failure and our sin to the Lord and receive His forgiveness and the cleansing of His precious blood
Although we may hesitate, because we have lost the Lord's presence, eventually we confess, apologize, and ask for forgiveness
Once more we have a clear sky, a sky like the firmament of terrible crystal over the heads of the living creatures
Whenever we have such a clear sky in our Christian life and in our church life, we will also have the throne, which is above the clear sky
We often talk about the Lord's presence, but we need to realize that the Lord's presence is always with the throne
Today many believers are careless in their daily Christian life because they do not have a clear sky with the throne above it
In a sense, because we have been saved, we are liberated, but in another sense we are under the throne and have no liberty at all
The highest step in the spiritual experience of a Christian is to have the throne in our firmament, in our clear sky
To have the throne, or to arrive at the throne, is to allow God to have the highest and most prominent position in our Christian life
To reach the throne in our spiritual experience means that in everything we are completely submissive to God's authority and administration
A believer who does not have a clear sky with a throne above it can easily be loose and careless in his daily living
If we have the throne above the clear sky, we are greatly blessed, and we should worship God for this blessing
If we have a throne in our spiritual life, God will not only rule over us but will also fulfill His purpose in us, with us, and through us
If you want God's purpose and plan to be carried out in you and with you, you must be a person who submits to the throne
The living creatures are still on earth, moving or standing, but above their heads there is a clear heaven with the throne
From what is portrayed here we can see that the throne in the heavens is transmitted to the earth through and with the living creatures
Electricity is in the generator at the power plant far away from our homes but electricity is transmitted to us through the electrical lines
We may be a loose and careless person, but when we come into the presence of such a brother, we realize that something is ruling over us
Whether we call it the throne or the Lord's presence, it is the transmission of the heavenly throne to the earth through this dear brother
Suppose the leading brothers or the elders in a local church are not under a clear sky, yet they exercise authority based on their position
Suppose the leading ones and the elders are continually under a clear sky, having a conscience that is pure and void of offense
If this is their situation, they will be under the heavenly throne, and with them there will be something weighty and something of authority
As long as we are under a clear sky with a throne above it, there is no need for us to claim to have authority-the authority is simply there
The Lord Jesus said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them
A particular brother may be quite proper in his speaking and behavior, but he is light as a feather, altogether lacking in spiritual weight
One day a boat on which she was traveling was seized by pirates, who retained control of the vessel for several days
A ferocious pirate leader came under the authority of this missionary because she herself was under the throne
The words out of one brother's mouth may have weight and power, but the same words out of another brother's mouth may have nothing
The reason is that one brother is under a clear sky with the throne, but the other is under a dark, cloudy sky without the throne
It is shameful to have power among the saints, to be the authority among the saints, or to intend that the saints should listen to us
If you are under a clear sky, there is no need for you to argue, and there is no need for you to claim anything or even say anything
A sapphire stone signifies a kind of heavenly condition which exists when God is present in a particular situation
According to Exodus 24:10 when Moses, Aaron, and the chief men of Israel saw God, they saw under His feet the appearance of a sapphire stone
A sapphire stone is blue in color, and blue is a heavenly color indicating the situation and condition of God's presence
Whenever we have a clear sky with God's throne in it, we are in a heavenly situation having the appearance of a sapphire stone
The Lord is upon the throne above the firmament in the heavens, and the living creatures are walking or standing on earth
Through them the Lord in the heavens becomes one with the earth, and in this way the heavens are connected to the earth
The heavens have been brought down to the earth and that the heavens are now moving on earth through, by, and with the living creatures
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it
They recognize the fact that from the manger in Bethlehem to the time He was on the cross at Golgotha He was a man
Matthew 1928 tells us that in the restoration that is in the coming kingdom age the Son of Man will be sitting on the throne of His glory
There is at least a twofold significance to the fact that the One sitting on the throne here has the appearance of a man
Having the nature of man, He lived, died, resurrected, and ascended as a man, and now in heaven He is still the Son of Man
God's intention is to work Himself into us, making us the same as He is, and even more, making Himself the same as we are
The crucial point here is that because man was created in the image of God in order to express God, only man is like God
God's grace works upon a group of people to such an extent that their condition now is the very condition of heaven
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God manifest in the flesh, for He was the God-man and had the appearance of a man
Now, as the One on the throne after His ascension, He is still the God-man; He is God, yet with the appearance of a man
When this is the condition of the church, there will be in the church the great mystery of godliness-God manifested in the flesh
Inwardly we should have God, but God is manifested in the flesh, manifested in and through a normal and proper humanity
The Lord will bring us to the throne, but if we are still careless and loose, we are not ready to be on the throne
If you mean business with the Lord as a Christian and as a disciple of the Lord Jesus, you cannot be loose, careless, and undisciplined
Many believers today, on the contrary, do not seem to have the proper concept and feeling about how to be a proper human being
God's throne is absolute, but one of His creatures has rebelled and seeks to exalt his throne to be equal with that of God
In his rebellion against God's throne, Satan intended to exalt his throne to the heavens and thereby to intrude upon God's authority
God's intention is to cast Satan down and to redeem many of those taken captive by Satan and bring them to His throne
He will triumphantly declare that His chosen ones, who had been taken captive by Satan, have been brought to the throne
We have been called to be sons of God, and we are destined to be kings, but we need God to work in us and on us to qualify us for kingship
It is not easy for us to realize that a man who could be crucified and buried could be the Lord of the universe
After He was crucified and buried, God resurrected Him and set Him at His right hand, making Him the Lord of all the universe
After this burning something will remain and that will be the electruma mixture of gold and silver signifying the LambGod the redeeming God
When others are with us, they will be able to sense that we have the electrum, the redeeming God, remaining with us
Ezekiel 128 says As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about
The rainbow, therefore, was a sign of God's faithfulness and promise not to destroy the fallen human race with a flood
In His judgment and destruction of the fallen human race at the time of Noah, God spared some by His faithfulness
Although God is a holy God and a consuming fire and none can exist in His presence, by His faithfulness we have been spared
In ourselves we are short of God's glory , we are under God's righteous judgment, and we are kept away by God's holiness
We need to experience Christ in such a way that when others contact us, they can sense righteousness, holiness, and glory
As those who were fallen but who have now been saved, we have become a testimony of God's faithfulness in saving us
In eternity we, the aggregate of the saved ones, will be a rainbow testifying forever that our God is righteous and faithful
By His righteousness holiness and glory we will have the appearance of a rainbow declaring to the whole universe Gods saving faithfulness
At the end of the Bible is a city whose foundation has the appearance of a rainbow surrounding the eternal God as His strong testimony
Throughout the ages, God has been judging fallen man according to His righteous throne, His holy fire, and His glorious nature
The appearing of this rainbow indicates that heaven and earth have been connected and that God and man have been joined
Although this rainbow will be manifested in eternity, the spiritual reality of this bright rainbow should be manifest in the church today
In the church life we need to allow God to work in us and we need to receive grace to the extent that everything becomes pure just and holy
These three characteristics will combine and reflect one another to form a bright rainbow expressing God and testifying for Him
The issue, the result, of God's recovery by life is a holy building, which is the consummation of the entire book of Ezekiel
Ultimately, the book of Revelation, like the book of Ezekiel, consummates with God's building with its twelve gates
From this we see that the books of Ezekiel and Revelation are not only similar but are also parallel to each other
The former is on the history of God's people in the Old Testament; the latter is a revelation of the church in the New Testament
In a sense, the picture in the Old Testament is more clear and complete than the revelation in the New Testament
God's judgment is first upon His people, the children of Israel, and then His judgment comes upon the Gentiles
God's putting the people of Israel into the good land typifies God's putting us into Christ, who is our good land today
In the first stage they enjoyed Christ in Egypt as the Passover with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs
In the second stage they enjoyed Christ while they were wandering in the wilderness as the heavenly manna and the living water
The ultimate enjoyment of Christ is to enjoy Christ in the church as the good land with all His unsearchable riches
On the one hand, the life of the Lord Jesus is a redeeming life-a life which has the blood that was shed for our redemption
These two aspects of His life have been blended to produce milk as our spiritual drink and honey as our spiritual food
In the church life today, we enjoy Christ as our good land, and therefore we have God's presence and God's authority
Such a vine is for God's economy, and it should produce something that can make God happy and cause people to rejoice
The vine tree in John 15 is formed by the union of the glorious Christ, God's Son, and all who believe into Him and belong to Him
Whereas the vine is a matter of the flow of life and the manifestation of grace, the wife is a matter of love and satisfaction
What will satisfy God the most and bring Him the greatest pleasure will be the church as His bride, His counterpart
If we read the long record in Ezekiel from chapter two to chapter twenty-four, we may feel like weeping over Israel's pitiful condition
In verses 5 and 6 God referred to them as 'a rebellious house,' and in verse 7 He said that 'they are most rebellious'
According to Revelation 17 and 18 today's Christianity is not a bride but a great harlot with many daughter harlots
In these verses we see a principle: All those who have idols within them and yet seek God in an outward way cannot find God
In Revelation 2 we see that the degradation of the churches began with the leaving of the first love to the Lord
If we realize this, we will see that the cause of the degradation of Israel and of the church is exactly the same
Although they might be discussing their work for the Lord, if He were to come into their meeting, they would not know Him
Tozer's observation indicates that it is common for Christians to love many things other than the Lord Himself
Anything that we love more than we love the Lord will bring us into association with the world and lead us into worldliness
After the people of Israel became associated with the nations, they began to walk after the manners and customs of the nations
The way we live, the way we spend our money, and the way we dress should not be after the manner of the nations
Now let us go on to consider the various kinds of people among the children of Israel described in these chapters of Ezekiel
We see that the priests violated the word of God, profaned the holy things, and even profaned the Lord Himself
They minister God's word in a violent way, cheating and misleading others by the wrong use of the Word and profaning the name of God
Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord'
Today's situation is similar, for very few Christians are willing to stand in the gap for the Lord's recovery and for the Lord's interest
The meaning of this parable is that many prophets ministered the word of God in a way that was not properly tempered
To minister the word of God in such an untempered way is to be not saturated with the Holy Spirit and not soaked with the experience of life
A word which is fully saturated with the Spirit and with the experience of the divine life is absolutely different
From this we see that we need teaching that is saturated with the Spirit and soaked with the proper experience of the divine life
Rather, it is ministering the word of God in a way that is real, solid, and thoroughly saturated with the Holy Spirit
Such a word will protect us, strengthen us, build us together, and enable us to stand against every kind of storm
An even worse situation than that of the false prophets existed among the daughters of the people, who prophesied out of their own heart
God's judgment upon His people was based on three things: the righteousness of God, the holiness of God, and the glory of God
The crucial matter here is that God's righteousness, holiness, and glory are the basis upon which God exercises His judgment over His people
In chapters two through twenty-four there are some negative things which are versus the righteousness, holiness, and glory of God
Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God withdrew step by step, leaving the temple, the city, and the people
The glory of the Lord stopped there and waited for a while, but eventually it left that mountain and went back to the heavens
If we love our work, activity, or practice more than the Lord, even such things, which are for the Lord, may be idols
These ones may love others, but their love is according to the natural human emotion and contains a great deal of mixture or impurity
Those who express such love, kindness, and humility are in the flesh, doing good things or expressing something in a good way
God judged His people by four terrible things: the sword, famine, pestilence or disease, and wild, noisome beasts
The escapees died from the lack of food; others were killed by pestilence; and the remainder were devoured by beasts
It indicates that something idolatrous unholy or unrighteous has brought in Gods judgment which is first by the sword that is by fighting
If we desire to have the healthy word, the supply of Christ, and the rich and special spiritual food, we need oneness, peace, and harmony
In Acts 20:29 Paul warned the elders from Ephesus that one day wolves would come into the church who would have no pity on the flock
Today's Christianity is characterized by fighting, by the shortage of food, by spiritual diseases, and by roaring, devouring beasts
During the time of Eli, the people of Israel fought against the Philistines with the ark in a superstitious way and were defeated
After Nebuchadnezzar captured Jehoiachin, he established Jehoiachin's brother, Zedekiah, as the king over Israel
In the midst of His judgment upon Israel, God was merciful to His people and provided a number of things for them
He said that He would make Ezekiel's forehead harder than theirs and his heart harder than theirs, as a diamond is harder than flint
He became not a permanent sanctuary like the one in Jerusalem but a temporary sanctuary to His captured and scattered people
And there, in some homes and groups, they have the Lord's presence in a temporary way as a temporary sanctuary
We praise the Lord that in His mercy He promised those in the captivity that one day He would bring them back to the land
The Christ whom we experience and enjoy today in the local churches is very high, for He is the resurrected and ascended Christ
Christ, who belongs to the house of David and who was born as a descendant of the house of David, is a tender branch of the cedar of David
In this way God planted Christ in a high place, and Christ became a majestic cedar under which many people will dwell
God's reply was to ask a question: Since He was going to burn everything, should they make mirth by saying this?
At Ezekiel's time other nations had conquered and oppressed the people of Israel, and they had no way to go on
The result of God's judgment upon the church is to gain a group of people who return to Christ and gain Christ
If we look at a map, we will see that Palestine, the good land where God put Israel, is the real center of the inhabited earth
Palestine is situated at the center of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the continents where the human race began
We know from history that the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem and then spread to Europe, Egypt, and Asia
Their degraded situation forced God to exercise His judgment upon them and temporarily to give up Palestine as His center
Through the empire of Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed His judgment not only upon His people Israel but also over the nations
Chapters twenty-five through thirty-two of Ezekiel speak of seven nations that surrounded the nation of Israel
There were more than seven nations surrounding Israel, but the Lord selected seven nations as representatives of all the nations
The first four nationsAmmon Moab Edom and Philistiaform the first group Tyrus and Zidon make up the second group and Egypt stands alone
His first vision covers the first four nations; his second vision, Tyrus and Zidon; and his third vision, Egypt
Previously we pointed out that the spiritual application of the noisome beasts is that some evil people could be in the church as wolves
They were happy about three things the sanctuary being profaned the good land being made desolate and the house of Judah being carried away
The sanctuary was a type of the incarnated Christ tabernacling on earth as God's dwelling place, God's sanctuary
The sanctuary signifies Christ, the good land signifies all of God's rich grace in Christ, and the house of Judah signifies the church
During the first two centuries of the church, the Roman Empire was an 'Ammonite,' hating Christ, God's grace, and the church
We may say that, in a sense, our old man and our new man are 'cousins,' for they are quite close to each other
According to the record of Ezekiel, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel, continually seeking revenge and vengeance
On the one hand, you are a real Israelite loving the church; on the other hand, you are also a real Edomite, hating the church
Sometimes you love the church and all the leading ones, but at other times you hate the church and all the elders
The brother who is taking the lead may endeavor to do many things for the church, exercising his wisdom, power, and capabilities
He may even conduct himself in a political way, maneuvering in various situations and exercising control to work things out
Some churches can hardly go on because they are frustrated by the old man and the natural man of the leading brothers
In the church there is no place for things of the old man, such as jealousy, pride, competition, and dissenting
In the church life in the Lord's recovery, we are not afraid of the 'Ammonites,' and we are only a little fearful of the 'Moabites'
Tyrus typifies those who are seeking worldly wealth, those who desire to make a great deal of money and to be rich
If you speak to them concerning Christ, the church, or the Lord's testimony, they do not understand what you are talking about
They are interested only in what will help them to have a better living, to make more money, or to get a higher position
As recorded in the book of Ezekiel, the people of Tyrus declared that Jerusalem would fall, and they were happy about it
Desiring to make more money and to secure a better living for themselves, they do not care for the church or the Lord's interest
The Lord Jesus said that the deceitfulness of riches and the anxiety of the age are like thorns which choke the growth of life
In addition, they exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources in order to become rich and have a sufficient supply
God said that He would send Egypt, with its 'garden of Eden,' to Hades, to the pit, to the depths of the earth
Others creep into the church and try to bring the church into association with the world and to make the church the same as the world
The 'Tyrians' seek the riches of the world, and the 'Zidonians' become briers and thorns to the church due to the seeking of riches
Because we go along with our natural man, in His judgment, sometimes God will even destroy us and make us desolate
If our old man and our natural man destroy the church of God, God will destroy us with our old man and natural man
The second result, or issue, of God's judgment upon the nations was that God's purpose was carried out and fulfilled
The record regarding these seven nations is arranged not according to historical events but according to meaning
We may say that we love the church, but if we pursue the wealth and riches of the world, we will become a damage to the church life
We need to look to the Lord that, in His mercy, none of us in the local churches in the Lord's recovery would care for worldly riches
The last nation, Egypt, is closely related to Tyrus and Zidon and represents the development of natural resources for others to trust in
After the warning of the watchman, God did not send an angel or another person; He Himself came as the Shepherd
In God's recovery by life, He first sends the watchman to His people to repent, turn, and live, and then He Himself appears as the Shepherd
Ezekiel 34:11 says, 'For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out'
In Luke 15 we have both the shepherd seeking the lost sheep and the woman lighting the lamp and searching within the house for the lost coin
After we were saved, we backslid into degraded Christianity, and we were buried under many things, such as doctrines, forms, and gifts
We see that Ezekiel prophesied that as the Shepherd the Lord would bring His people, His sheep, out of the nations
They were in captivity in heathen countries, but the Lord promised to bring them back to their own country, to the good land of Canaan
When we were brought back to Christ, we were also brought to the church life, where we have the riches and the enjoyment of the good land
We can testify that in the local churches we have the sense that the Lord Jesus is feeding us day by day by the rivers of living water
In the meetings of the local churches, we do have the sense that we are by the rivers and in the pasture, that we are drinking and eating
Praise the Lord that we are under the care of our Shepherd, drinking by the rivers and feeding in the pasture!
If the church life is right, then when others come to the meetings, they will sense that they are by a flowing river and in a good pasture
In Song of Songs 1:7 the seeker asked the Lord where He fed His sheep, where He gave His flock rest at noontime
Praise the Lord that while we are eating, drinking, and resting, we are under His binding, strengthening, and healing
Only after He gives us the life supply, binds up our wounds, and heals us can all the unjust things among us be cleared away
If we lack the Lord's supply, binding, and healing, we will condemn others, blame others, and complain about others
The One who nourishes us and supplies us causes us to have an accurate sense concerning our relationships with the brothers and sisters
When we have such a sense, we judge ourselves, and as a result we have a genuine oneness with the saints as the one flock
Since the Lord Jesus is our Shepherd taking care of us, we should not worry about our problems or about our living
As He cares for us, He feeds us, and we have the real experience of Psalm 23: The Lord is our Shepherd, and we have no want
The issue of the Lord's caring for us as our Shepherd is that we obey Him as our King and come under His kingship
Ezekiel 34:25a says, 'I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land'
We are told that, under the Lord's shepherding, all the evil beasts will be kept away from the Lord's recovered people
The Lord promised not only that His people would receive His blessing but also that He would make them a blessing
We ourselves will enjoy the Lord's blessing, and then He will cause us to become a source of blessing to others so that they may be supplied
Many times in the meetings of the local churches we sense that something is not only flowing but also coming down like a shower
Sometimes even at home after the meeting, we have the sense that the showers of blessing are still coming down upon us
Because the local churches are rich with spiritual food, in the Lord's recovery there is no more famine, no shortage of food
At the start of a meeting, we may seem to have only five small loaves, but after the meeting we have twelve full baskets left over
The Lord promised to raise up a plant of renown, whose fruit would be for the enjoyment of His recovered people
From this we see that the recovery of the church life is not a matter of teachings or gifts but a matter of the Lord's presence
Following this, in chapter thirty-five the Lord reminds us of the need to condemn our old man, which is signified by Edom
You have been recovered and you have been brought back to Christ as the good land and have entered into the rich enjoyment of Christ
Now as you are enjoying Christ, he is with you, hating your enjoyment of Christ and your enjoyment of the church life
The judgment upon Ammon, Moab, Tyrus, Zidon, and Egypt may be once for all, but the judgment upon Edom cannot be once for all
The genuine recovery of the Lord is not simply a matter of repenting, turning to the Lord, and enjoying the blessing of the Lord
In His recovery, God needs to touch our heart and our spirit and thereby touch our life directly and change us in life and nature
A major point in Ezekiel 36 is the recovery of the good land, that is, the restoration of the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ
In the Lord's recovery there are two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect, the outward recovery and the inward recovery
One day the Lord seeks you out and brings you back to Himself, to the church life, and to the fellowship with the saints
The Lord Jesus washes us with His cleansing blood not only when we are saved but also every time we are revived and brought back to Him
When we are revived we also have such a feeling of shame not wanting to recall the sinful and worldly things that we were once involved with
We praise the Lord that no matter how filthy we were, the Lord's blood is the clean water that washes us and cleanses us
Brother Nee asked her how many buttons were on her long gown, and without hesitation she told him the correct number
Some Christians have never shed a single tear for the Lord Jesus, but they have shed many tears for their clothing
Many of you have been Christians for years, but you have never heard a message telling you that you have a new spirit
No one told you that at the time of your conversion, the Lord gave you not only a new heart but also a new spirit
If we would contact the Lord, receive the Lord, enjoy the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord, we need a spirit
We need to love the Lord Jesus and have an appetite for Him that will turn us from the appetite for other things
We thank the Lord that He has given us not only a new heart to love Him but also a new spirit to contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him
At other times because our heart is soft, we may be troubled by even a small mistake or by a slight impurity in our motive
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we can sense that deep within something other than our heart has been exercised
Just as we know that we have two feet by using them to walk, we know that we have a spirit by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord
Of course, teachings and gifts have some value, but the main thing we need today is the exercise of the spirit
Many readers of 1 Corinthians appreciate the word in chapters twelve and fourteen about speaking in tongues and prophecy but neglect 15:45b
If we speak in the tongues of men and of angels and yet have no life in our spirit, this speaking is like sounding brass
The expression Thus saith the Lord is taken from the Old Testament, but it is not used by the New Testament writers
Of following Pentecostalism to adopt Old Testament expressions, we should learn to exercise our spirit to be one spirit with the Lord
Praise the Lord that we have a new heart and a new spirit and that we have the Holy Spirit within our spirit strengthening us all the time
God's commandments are according to His nature, and we have the nature of God within us because we have His Spirit within us
He promised that He will increase our number by flocks of men, but we need to pray for this and ask Him to do it
In 1963 in Los Angeles, we had only twenty to thirty people, but after we prayed for six months, the number was greatly increased
The first section, consisting of chapter one, speaks of the glorious vision of God and reveals the holy God in His glory
The third section, which includes chapters thirty-three through thirty-nine, concerns God's recovery of a remnant of His people
Each of these chapters may be represented by a single word: chapter one-fire; chapter thirty-seven-breath; and chapter forty-seven-water
Chapters thirty-three through thirty-seven of Ezekiel describe God's recovery of His people from different aspects
Chapter thirty-four emphasizes the Lord's coming as a Shepherd to seek His lost sheep and to bring them back to their own land
Because they had been driven away and scattered like sheep, they needed the Lord to search for them as their Shepherd
Christ is not only the good land, containing many trees whose fruits are good for food; Christ is also a plant of renown
We are simply told in a general way that the Lord will give us a new heart and a new spirit and put His own Spirit within us
If we had only Ezekiel 36, we would realize that we were sinful and filthy, but we would not think that we were dead
In the sight of God, when we were fallen, either as a sinner or as a backslidden believer, we were dead and buried in a grave
Today many Christians are buried in the graves of denominations, divisions, independent groups, and different movements
Many of us can testify that formerly we were in such graves, dead, dry, scattered, disjointed, and not connected to anyone
The Lord did not come in directly to be our Shepherd, but, in keeping with Ezekiel 37, He came in through the prophesying of His word
From this we can see clearly that the main meaning of prophesying is not to predict but to speak forth something for the Lord
When Ezekiel prophesied, God blew the wind, the people received the breath, and the breath became the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit
Sinews, flesh, and skin came upon the bones, covering the bones and causing their appearance to be much improved
Formerly they were only dry bones; now they were a lifeless body with the parts gathered up, joined, and connected
Rather, we should first come together, with 'a noise' and 'a shaking,' and then the breath of God will be breathed upon us
Throughout the years, here in the church in Los Angeles we have paid our attention not to gifts or to teachings but to life
Among us we have many former ministers, pastors, missionaries, and Bible teachers, but all of these are now one in life
It is very good that in the migrations saints come from different parts of the country to be one in a particular city
In chapter thirty-five there is Edom, the enemy within, and in chapters thirty-eight and thirty-nine there is the enemy outside
We have to judge Edom, the old man, the enemy within us, but the Lord will take care of the enemies which are outside
In the foregoing messages we saw the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life
We may even say that the issue of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord is the building of God
The vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord which Ezekiel saw in chapter one was seen in the fifth year of the captivity
The vision of the building of God's house which he saw in chapter forty was in the twenty-fifth year of the captivity
We need to remember that when Ezekiel saw the first vision, he was thirty years of age, the age at which a priest began to function
Due to their immaturity in the divine life, very few of today's Christians have seen anything regarding the Lord's building
Spiritually speaking, many are far below the age of thirty and thus are not even qualified to be an apprentice
Five, which is composed of four plus one, signifies that man as a creature plus God as the Creator together bear responsibility
It stood for fourteen years, and after those fourteen years the people in captivity realized that it was a strong testimony
According to Exodus 12:3 the tenth day of the first month was the day that the people of Israel prepared the lamb for the Passover
From this we see that whenever we have a new beginning in our Christian life, it must be based on Christ and His redemption
Any new beginning that we can have in our spiritual life is always based on Christ, the Passover Lamb, and His redemption
When we come back to Christ, we may sense in our spirit that we are in an elevated place, that is, in the resurrected and ascended Christ
Many of us can testify that while we were in captivity in the denominations, we could not see the vision of the building of the church
In the book of Revelation the apostle John told us that he was carried away in spirit to a high mountain to see the holy city, New Jerusalem
The reason they are offended is that, regarding spiritual matters, they are like little children playing with toys
If you tell them that they need to grow up in the spiritual life and give up their toys, they may be quite upset
In chapter one, in the vision of the glory of the Lord, the Lord Jesus on the throne as a man looked like electrum
The Lord Jesus is not on the throne but is at the gate in the appearance of brass to measure and to take possession
While God was showing the vision of His building to Ezekiel, the prophet needed to have keen sight and to listen intently
If we want to seek God, contact God, fellowship with God, and serve God, we need to realize that God has His dwelling place
We need to consider the vision of God's building in Ezekiel, for this vision describes the place where God dwells-His holy temple
On each pavement are five chambers built as places for the people to eat and enjoy the sacrifices and offerings
Within the outer court there is an inner court, which also has gates on three sides, on the east, south, and north
The altar at the center of the compound indicates that the cross of Christ is at the very center of God's economy and of God's interests
In Ezekiel 40-48, a section on God's building, three main things are covered: the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land
We see an indication of this in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which speaks of our 'spirit and soul and body,' not of body, soul, and spirit
In a city of millions of people, we can know who is of God and who is not of God by Christ as the separating line
In other words, whoever belongs to Christ is within the wall, and whoever is outside of Christ is outside of the wall
It is impossible for any fallen human beings to imitate Christ, the One who is square, upright, perfect, and complete
Young people, you are not obedient to your parents while you are seeking after your Father's interests, but the Lord Jesus was obedient
The middle part, the passage, is also called a threshold, but as a help to our understanding we may use the word passage
By passing through the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the lobby, one can enter into the temple
The Lord Jesus was able to fulfill every commandment, and He has become the gate for us to enter into God's building
By putting all these numbers together we can realize that Christ was the Triune God who became a man having the number six
If there were no wall, sinful people would be able to enter into the temple, and that would be an insult to God's glory and holiness
He was a square upright and proper man able to fulfill the Ten Commandments and now He Himself is the guardrooms of Gods glory and holiness
By passing through Christ as the gate, we are qualified to enter into God's building, which is full of God's glory and holiness
On one side there are two spaces of five cubits each, and on the other side there are also two spaces of five cubits
The Lord Jesus as the Triune God became a man and died on the cross to fulfill all the responsibilities of the Ten Commandments
If we deduct one cubit for the border around the guardroom on each side, this leaves the passage only eight cubits wide
Fifteen is composed of three times five, signifying the Triune God in resurrection bearing all the responsibility
As we will see in a later message, the expression of Christ, as seen in the side chambers of the temple, is also in the number thirty
The expression of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ, and the supporting by Christ are all signified by the number thirty
Christ, the guard of God's holiness and glory, is the everlasting, victorious One standing, bearing, sustaining, and prevailing
In the previous portion, mainly the numbers five, six, and ten are used, but with the porch the number eight is used
These are not narrow windows but latticed windows, having strips of material over them to protect the building from negative things
Christ is the testimony of God, and as the resurrected One, the enlivening life-giving Spirit, He is a living witness of victory forever
As we have pointed out, the dimensions of the guardrooms match the dimensions of the cross section of the wall-six cubits by six cubits
There are thirty supporting posts, thirty chambers in the outer court, and thirty side chambers surrounding the temple
In Ezekiel the number thirty indicates both maturity which is able to bear something and also the enjoyment and expression of Christ
Because the columns must bear the weight of the roof and support the entire building, they need to be in victory and to be everlasting
In this message we will go on to see that with the temple in Ezekiel there are two courts: the outer court and the inner court
There is pavement around the wall on the three sides of the outer court, on the east, the south, and the north
In addition to the thirty chambers on the pavement, there are four small courts, one at each corner of the outer court
From this we can see that the main thing in the outer court is the enjoyment of Christ as the offerings and sacrifices
They are genuine Christians, but they are standing on dirt; they do not have a pavement of stones under their feet
By contacting the Lord early in the morning, we put our feet on the stones and prepare ourselves to come into the chambers
The number thirty, used in relation to the chambers, is composed either of five times six or of three times ten
If thirty is composed of three times ten, then we have the Triune God in resurrection fulfilling all the requirements
If the all-inclusive Spirit were not of the number thirty, we could not have the rich enjoyment of Christ as the number thirty
If we consult the diagram of the plot plan, we will see that the width of the pavement equals the length of the gate
If our experience of Christ measures fifty cubits, then our enjoyment of Christ will also measure fifty cubits
The more we pass through Christ, the more we experience Christ, and the more we experience Christ, the more we enjoy Christ
The people of Israel were in the wilderness forty years, and the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness forty days in order to be tested and tried
At the entrance to the inner court, there is another set of stairs, consisting not of seven steps but of eight
From this we see that entering into the inner court means that the more inward we travel, the higher we become
When we pass through the gate into the inner court, we are fifteen steps higher than the people who are outside the wall
In the outer court there is some enjoyment through the boiling and the eating, but there is no service, no ministry to the Lord
There is a chamber, probably within the north gate of the inner court, for the priests to wash the burnt offerings
The chamber here is not for killing the burnt offering; neither is the chamber for skinning the offering or for cutting it into pieces
In the inner court we have improvement and progress, for here we are in something that is more inward and also higher
According to our actual experience, if we remain in the outer court, we are still only the people; we are not yet priests
By adding the one and a half cubits of the length to the one and a half cubits of the breadth, we have three cubits
The Triune God has been 'split,' as indicated by the two sides of the gate, with each measuring one and a half cubits
Our service today is in the Triune God, the only God, who was 'split' and who is now in resurrection to be a testimony
From the gate we proceed into the court, where there are two more chambers, one on the north side and another on the south side
These two chambers are for two groups of priests: those who take care of the temple and those who take care of the altar
These chambers indicate that at this point their service, their ministry, is settled, fixed, stable, and steady
Eventually, by the mercy of the Lord we came into the chambers and there we began to taste Christ and enjoy Him
We begin the ministry the service with the Triune God who became a creature who was split and who is now in resurrection as a testimony
Now we become fully qualified priests settled steadfastly in the chambers and taking care of the temple and the altar
In this message we will go on from the inner gate and even from the inner court to consider the central matter-the altar
We have seen that altogether there are six gates in three groups of two, on the east, on the south, and on the north
As the chart on page 215 indicates, there are three sections of one hundred cubits each, making a total of three hundred cubits
As the center of the universe, the cross signifies the all-inclusive death of God, of man, and of all the creatures
The altar is not only the center of the universe but also the meeting place of God with man and of man with God
The Lord Jesus said, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
He was speaking of Himself as the one grain who would fall into the ground and die in order to be multiplied into many grains
Through the cross the divine life was released, and then this life was imparted to us through Christ's resurrection
If we bury a grain of wheat and a small stone, something living will grow out of the grain of wheat, but the stone will remain buried
Through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat was released, but we, a dead 'stone,' were terminated
Although we have been terminated in this way, the divine life has been imparted into us to make us wonderful persons
We have pointed out that since the cross, the altar, occupies a central place in our relationship with God, we cannot avoid it
To come to the altar at the center is to realize that all that we are and all that we have were terminated at the cross
If a married brother and his wife argue with each other, this indicates that they are not living a crucified life
While we were wandering in the world, having no intention of entering in through the gate, the Lord brought us through the gate
Because of His mercy to us and His operation within us, we have no choice except to go forward; we cannot turn back
If we do not advance toward the altar but instead try to go back to the outer court, we will feel uncomfortable
Eventually, all those who are spiritual and who pursue the Lord end up on the altar where they are terminated, even destroyed, by the Lord
Because we love the Lord and pursue Him, sooner or later we will meet the cross, which will tear us down and bring everything into death
How can we prove from the record in the book of Ezekiel that God, man, and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross?
The number one signifies the unique God; thus, the base of the altar being one cubit high indicates that God is the base of the altar
The number four signifying the creature, the number six signifying man, and the number three signifying the Triune God are all here
From all this we can see that God is here, that Christ is here, and that all creatures, including man, are here
The greater ledge, the section which is directly under the upper altar, has an edge on either side which measures one cubit
By putting all these numbers together, we can realize that this signifies that the creature in fullness bears a complete testimony
The number eighteen is composed of six times three or three times six, signifying man, the Triune God, and resurrection
The horns on the altar, which are toward the four corners of the earth and which are also upward, signify the power of the cross of Christ
We may feel that, according to our human measurement and standard, we are qualified, but according to the divine measurement, we fall short
Without the proper realization and experience of the cross of Christ, we cannot have the reality of the church life
If we desire to have the proper church life, we need an adequate realization and experience of the altar, of the cross of Christ
It is only after we realize that we have been thoroughly terminated on the cross that we can have the real church life
To be in the outer court having the enjoyment of Christ is wonderful, but it is far from the experience of the temple
To be in the inner court where the ministry begins is also wonderful, but even this is far from the experience of the temple
The cross, Christ, and the church are the central subject not only of the New Testament but also of the whole Bible
As we pass through the cross, our flesh, our old creation, our self, and our natural man with the natural life will all be dealt with
We will be one in the Lord, we will have genuine coordination, and we will have harmony, rest, and the presence of Christ
We can calculate this because the ten steps to the temple are equal to the height of the platform of the temple
These pillars signify Christ as God's witness bearing the house of God with a strength which is unlimited and immeasurable
The first entrance, that of the porch, measures fourteen cubits, but the second entrance to the outer court measures ten cubits
The length of the outer temple is forty cubits, and the breadth is twenty cubits, making a total of eight hundred square cubits
The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was a square , and the Holy of Holies in the temple that was built in the good land was also a square
Twenty cubits squared, the area of the inner temple, equals four hundred cubits, that is, one hundred times four
Five times four becoming one hundred times four signifies God in the creature, with the creature as God's dwelling place
These side chambers are of three stories, each having thirty side chambers, making a total of ninety side chambers
The first floor of the wall is six cubits wide, the second floor is five cubits wide, and the third floor is four cubits wide
Because these are set one upon the other, a ledge of one cubit is created, and the beam of the side chambers is placed upon this ledge
Because the side chambers at the first level are four cubits broad, they signify us as the creatures in a general way
As we go higher and become even broader, we become the number six, the proper man created by God on the sixth day
Just as the side chambers are the beauty of the temple, so the beauty of Christ is the church, the Body, as His fullness
There are thirty chambers on the pavement, thirty windows in the gates, and thirty sides of the posts in the gates
Of the thirty side chambers, twelve are on the north side, twelve are on the south side, and six are on the west side
The number five here indicates those of us who have received God's grace and who are bearing responsibility before God
We have pointed out that the latticed windows are for letting in air and light and for blocking out the negative things
The spaces outside the side chambers that are left free are five cubits in breadth , the same measurement as the thickness of the outer wall
We need to see that no matter how much we bear responsibility by the grace of God, there will always be a surplus of grace
Between the space left of the side chambers and the holy chambers, there are open spaces twenty cubits in width
From this we see that the Christ whom we experience and the grace which we enjoy are spacious, broad, rich, full, and with much surplus
If we live in the Lord, our meeting and serving should be with space left over, that is, with a surplus of grace
The temple measures one hundred cubits by sixty cubits, but the building at the back measures one hundred cubits by eighty cubits
When we experience and enjoy the riches of Christ, we become the church as the fullness of Christ, His expression
Whereas the side chambers indicate the fullness of Christ, the building at the back indicates the riches of Christ
If the brother would provide you a vacant, spacious room prepared especially for you, this would indicate that he is rich
In principle, Christ as the building always has something left over, and what is left over exceeds what is used
Unlike an apartment building displaying a sign that says 'No Vacancy,' with Christ the 'sign' always says 'Vacant'
The width of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, is also one hundred cubits
The proper humanity is not our natural humanity; the proper humanity is the crucified, resurrected, and ascended humanity of Jesus
Among the cherubim are palm trees, signifying the victory of Christ and the everlasting and ever-existing power of Christ
In chapter one the cherubim had four faces but in the carvings on the walls they have only two facesthe face of a man and the face of a lion
We need to pay attention to the fact that the cherubim and palm trees are not painted on the wood but are carved into the wood
When we meet certain brothers and sisters, we have the impression that upon them there is something carved of the Lord
The incense altar in the tabernacle was made of wood overlaid with gold, signifying humanity overlaid with divinity
As an altar it is good for us to offer something to God, and as a table it is good for God to minister something to us
As we apply this to our situation today, we may say that when positive ones, such as the apostles, come, we should surely open the door
The fact that each door is made of two folding pieces shows us that the doors are flexible, turning and folding
The holy chambers are fifty cubits wide and one hundred cubits long, with a walkway ten cubits wide between them
The many doors in the south building open toward the north, and the many doors in the north building open toward the south
Now we see that the holy chambers are for the priests to eat the offerings and also to place and store the offerings
In the chambers on the pavements the people can enjoy Christ but they cannot express Christ because they do not have the priestly clothing
These holy chambers testify for each other, and when they are combined, there is absolute and perfect completeness
When we have the enjoyment of Christ signified by the third level, we appreciate fellowship, confirmation, and being open to others
Because of the space taken by the galleries, the chambers on the third story are smaller than those on the first and second stories
At the end, toward the rear, there are the boiling places, two places for the priests to boil their offerings and to bake the meal offerings
Only an area in the center five hundred cubits square was used, leaving a wide, spacious land surrounding the temple compound
On every side of the temple compound, there is a spacious 'suburb' of one thousand two hundred fifty cubits reaching to the wall
When the Lord in His leaving stopped on the threshold of the house, this indicated that He was not happy to leave
For His coming back He needs a place for the soles of His feet to rest, a place upon which He can set His feet
Throughout the centuries the enemy in his subtlety has kept Christians from knowing anything about the building
These messages were not released so that people could be spiritual in an individual way but so that the church could be built up
Those who put out the inner-life books by Brother Nee do not have much regard for his books on the church life
; The Song of Songs; and so forth- all books on the individual spiritual life-but very few sell Brother Nee's books on the church
Even if many spiritual people such as Daniel had been raised up in Babylon, the glory of the Lord would not have gone there to fill them
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the glory of God returned only after the building of the temple was completed
In order for the glorious God to dwell in the church, the church must be built up to become the dwelling place of God
The Lord returned not only with glory but also with a great noise, for His voice was as the noise of many waters
There was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting'
Whenever the church has a revival, God's glory is expressed, the voice of God is heard, and God's glory shines forth
Ezekiel 43:3 says that the appearance of the Lord was the same when He returned as when He came with the prophet to destroy the city
At that time the Lord's people were in a low place, in the bottom, but the Lord was riding among them to bring them out
Ezekiel 43:4 says, 'The glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east'
In the church life we need several gates, but the most important one is the east gate-the gate that is open to the glory of the Lord
The throne is for God's government, administration, and kingdom; it is the place from which He can administrate
Unless the church is built up, the Lord has no standing to administrate His government and to move on the earth
The Lord did not rebuke the house of Israel for their behavior and conduct, but for their whoredom and carcasses
No matter how good, pure, or holy something may be, if we love that thing more than we love the Lord Himself, this is whoredom
The Lord did not charge Ezekiel to teach God's people the law and the Ten Commandments as He had charged Moses
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'From now on, it is a matter not of the dispensation of the law but of the dispensation of My house
You have to keep the form, the fashion, the ordinances, the statutes, the laws, the comings in, and the goings out related to the house
According to verse 10 God wanted Ezekiel to show the temple to the house of Israel so that the people would be ashamed of their iniquities
The temple of God is a pattern, and if the people would examine themselves in light of this pattern, they would know their shortcomings
It was God's intention to check the living and conduct of the people of Israel by His house, His habitation, as a rule and pattern
Showing the temple to God's people exposes their sins and shortcomings and causes them to be ashamed of their iniquities
Most believers today feel that moral regulations and spiritual principles are sufficient as rules of behavior and conduct
The common, or lower, teachings in today's Christianity tell the believers how to behave, that is, what to do and what not to do
Everything he does is for himself individually; nothing is for the church, the Body, Christ's corporate expression
Once we reach the rear of the third story, we realize that we cannot escape, for there are no gates through which we can go out
If a piece of wood were either larger or smaller than its prescribed measure, it would not fit properly into the building
If she presumes to stand on the position of a brother she will not be within her measure and this will not match the building or fit into it
We should be God's people not according to the law of Moses but according to the form of the temple in Ezekiel
We need to see from the book of Ezekiel that the requirement of the indwelling Christ is not according to the law but according to His house
We need to fashion ourselves according to the church and allow the church to measure us and check us in every aspect
In order to preserve the church life, we need purification, sanctification, and consecration through the cross
On the eighth day, in resurrection, we need to offer ourselves to the Lord as a burnt offering absolutely for His satisfaction
After this, from the eighth day onward, we can have a feast with the Lord, enjoying the riches of Christ in the presence of God
Verse 12 says, 'This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy
We see that the law of the house can be summed up in two points: The house must be upon the top of the mountain, and it must be most holy
If in our church life we are in resurrection and in the position of ascension and if we are most holy, then we can be God's habitation
Our work, behavior, and person must be according to the form, the pattern, the statutes, and the laws of the house
The standard of measurement is neither good behavior nor personal spirituality; the standard of measurement is the church
If our flesh, natural man, and old man have not been dealt with by the cross, we are not qualified to serve in the church life
A stranger is an uncircumcised person, someone whose flesh, natural man, and old man have not been dealt with by the cross
The Lord said that such persons could serve in the house, but they could not come near to the Lord or to the holy things
They could minister in the temple by helping the people to present their offerings, but they could not come near to the Lord and serve Him
Because the majority of Christians have gone astray, they have lost their qualification and position to serve the Lord in a direct way
Whereas the fat typifies the preciousness of the person of Christ, the blood signifies the redemptive work of Christ
The priests were not allowed to wear woolen garments because woolen garments would make the priests too warm and cause them to sweat
In the church service in the Lords recovery we need to avoid and even escape from any kind of selfenergy selfstruggle and selfendeavor
If a certain matter is of the Lord, the Lord will surely grant His abundant blessing upon it and work that matter out
Corinthians 11:5 indicates that to cut off, or shave off, all our hair signifies rebellion against the Lord's headship
Now we need to see that spiritually speaking to have long hair in the church life signifying selfglory is to desire and seek to be a leader
One problem in the church life is the lack of submission, and another is the desire for position and leadership
We are told that the priests who minister directly to the Lord in the inner court were not permitted to drink wine
A priest must be able to teach God's people what is holy and what is profane and what is clean and what is unclean
One who draws near to God as a priest must be able to discern these things and also be able to teach others to discern
Verse 24a says, 'In controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments'
To keep, or hallow, the Sabbath means that we accept all that God has done and take rest in all that God has accomplished
Having nothing positive to say they will speak only negative things to you perhaps criticizing the elders the coworkers or various saints
If we are defiled by something sinful, we can confess, receive the application of the blood of Christ, and immediately be cleansed
If we are defiled by death, it will take a period of time before we can be cleansed and purified from this defilement
If we want to serve the Lord in a direct way, we must stay away from dead persons and thereby keep ourselves from the defilement of death
In the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering'
Every time we draw near to God, we need to apply the Lord's redemption and receive the cleansing of His precious blood
All the heave offerings, all the firstfruits, and all the top produce of the people of the Lord belonged to these serving ones
Moses told the people of the Lord to offer to God one lamb out of ten, but Ezekiel told them to offer one out of two hundred
The offering of the wheat and the barley was to be one-sixtieth; of the oil, one-hundredth; and of the lambs, one two-hundredth
In our service to God, we need to 'heave' Christ, that is, offer the ascended Christ, the highest Christ, to God
According to Ezekiel's record there were the yearly offering, the monthly offering, the weekly offering, and the daily offering
The yearly offering was offered on the first day of the year, signifying that, in principle, every year we should have a new beginning
Keeping the Sabbath indicates that we are not trusting in our work but are fully trusting and enjoying the Lord's work
Now we know what kind of priests we need to be in order to serve the Lord and what we need to offer to the Lord
The first river, in chapter one, is the river Chebar, which was in the place where the people of God were held in captivity
To be near the river Chebar is to be in a place of discipline, but to be near the river of living water is to be in a place to receive life
The tree of life indicates that God wants us to eat Him, and the river indicates that God wants us to drink Him
Psalm 464 says There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High
These portions of the Word reveal that God as living water has flowed out from eternity into us to satisfy our thirst
Following this, the people began to have their living according to the house, according to its pattern, laws, and statutes
Their daily life and all their conduct began to be according to the form, fashion, pattern, statutes, and laws of the house
Finally, there were all the offerings: one lamb out of two hundred, one-sixtieth of the wheat and barley, and one-hundredth of the oil
He had a house-the place of His throne, a place for the soles of His feet, a place where He could dwell for His rest and satisfaction
Today many zealous Christians pay attention to outreach and to gospel work in the mission field, yet their situation is quite poor
They go out to work for the Lord, but no flow follows them, because they neglect the source-the building up of the church
If there is a strong building up in the local churches, there will be river flowing out of the building to other places
We need to give the Lord the highest position, and we also need to give the flow of the Lord the highest position
The Lord Jesus was tested and judged as a man, and because He was tested and judged, He is now testing and judging
Since one thousand signifies a complete unit, to measure a thousand means to measure a complete unit; it is a complete measuring
If we want to enjoy a flow that is deeper, we need to be measured, that is, tested, examined, judged, and taken over by the Lord
We may think that we have been fully taken over by the Lord, but after a period of time we will realize that we still have some reservation
We will be tested and judged again, and after this we will have a further consecration to the Lord, saying, 'Lord, take this and possess it'
We may think that the Lord has taken over everything, but the Lord knows that He has gained us only to a certain extent
It is difficult for the Lord to measure us, judge us, possess us, and take us over without adequate cooperation on our part
May we look to the Lord for His mercy that through His measuring in all the local churches there will be a river that no one can pass over
Once the flow of grace becomes so deep that we cannot pass over, we will praise the Lord and begin to swim in the river
As we are carried along in this way, we can easily follow the Lord and let Him lead us wherever He wants us to go
The best way for us to swim in the river is to put our trust in the flow of the river forget our own efforts and let the flow carry us along
If there is the flow of the river, deadness is swallowed up by life, and then the 'dead sea' will be made alive
Although the Dead Sea and the dry places can be made alive and deadness can be swallowed up by life, the marshes cannot be healed
If you give up the denominations and the independent groups yet are not absolute for the proper ground of the church, you are in a marsh
If a group of saints in a certain locality are the church in that locality, they must be the church after its kind
In this message we come to the end of Ezekiel, and we will consider two matters-the holy land and the holy city
On the third day of the Lord's recovery of His creation, the land was recovered, for on this day the land emerged from the waters of death
The land here in Genesis 1 typifies Christ, who was resurrected from the dead on the third day as the all-inclusive land
The Lord again brought the land out of the death waters, and the family of Noah was given the right to enjoy the land
In the course of this history, the descendants of Noah fell and eventually gathered at Babel to build a tower of rebellion against God
Four hundred years later, by God's deliverance, the people of Israel experienced the passover, left Egypt, and passed through the Red Sea
Later, due to their falling away from the Lord and their degradation, they were carried away from the land and lost it once again
In our reading of Ezekiel, we need to pay attention to the fact that many times the Lord promised to bring His people back to the land
It is crucial for us to realize that before we can have the recovery of the building, we need to have the recovery of the land
The animal life is for being slain so that blood may be shed for redemption, whereas the vegetable life is for producing and generating life
At the top of the Dead Sea is the river Jordan, which proceeds northward to another sea, the Sea of Galilee, or the Sea of Tiberias
The position of the good land between the waters of the Great Sea on the west and the waters of the Dead Sea on the east is significant
Now there is not only resurrection but also ascension, for Christ is not only the resurrected Christ but also the ascended Christ
Regarding the subdivisions of the land, seven of the tribes of Israel were in the north and five were in the south
When the twelve tribes were divided, only Judah and Benjamin remained with the Lord and did not participate in division
In Revelation 7 the name of Dan is not mentioned in the list of the tribes of Israel because of Dan's idolatry and degradation
The middle strip is twenty-five thousand reeds long from east to west and ten thousand reeds broad from north to south
The allotment of the land and the placement of the tribes upon their particular portion of the land are quite significant
The most important people were the priests, who were the closest to Christ and who maintained the fellowship between the people and the Lord
The temple is God's house, God's dwelling place, for His rest, and the city is God's kingdom for His authority
All the fellowship, service, work, government, royalty, lordship, and kingship come out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ
The more we enjoy Christ, the closer we are to Him, and the closer we are to Him, the more important we are in His purpose
Only one city in the Bible has twelve gates with the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is the city of Jerusalem
Because we will eventually become the New Jerusalem, we should apply to ourselves the things mentioned in Ezekiel
It is not only a mingling of divinity with humanity; it is also a perfect government which comes out of this mingling
No matter what direction we come from and no matter what gate we enter through, we will all be on the same street
The book of Ezekiel concludes with the words, 'The name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is there'
In the church as His building today, God has His temple, His dwelling place, and He also has His city for His administration
