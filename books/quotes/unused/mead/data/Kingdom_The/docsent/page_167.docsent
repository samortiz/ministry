   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Word of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the last ground, the word of Christ as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our work must be according to the living word of Christ, not according to the dead letter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The living word of Christ is the rock upon which we may build.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If our work is built upon the word of Christ as the rock, it will stand when the rain descends, the floods come, and the winds blow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, our work will be destroyed when it is tested from these three directions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The rains signify the tests from God; the floods signify the tests from man; and the winds signify the tests from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some testings come from God, others from man, and still others from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our work is based upon the word of Christ as the rock, it will stand regardless of the tests.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tests sent by God as the rain will not destroy that work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, the more the rain descends, the stronger the work will become.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 5 through 7 many aspects of the life of the kingdom people are covered by the Lord's words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord open our eyes to see and our hearts to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we must realize that the Lord never intended for us to carry out these words in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These words are simply the revelation of the reality of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our natural human life is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Matthew 5 through 7 we see the living and the reality of the Lord Jesus as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After seeing this, we all must say, "Lord Jesus, You are the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are the life for the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your life satisfies the requirements of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, help me that I may open myself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, come in day by day to nourish me, saturate me, possess me, transform me, and make me a part of Your maturity, to give me a share in the full manifestation of the kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, every aspect of the reality of the kingdom in these three chapters will be found in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our daily life and our work will correspond exactly to what is described in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We will be in the reality of the kingdom, and we will even become the reality of the kingdom.</S>
