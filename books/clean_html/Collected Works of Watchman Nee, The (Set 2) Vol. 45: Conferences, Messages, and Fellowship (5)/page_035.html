<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>Sanctification is a much-debated topic today. As far as we know, all the teachings on sanctification take sanctification as a moral virtue, an act, or an inward condition. They all consider sanctification to be a thing, an object. If a person has this kind of concept, it means that he does not know what it means for Christ to be our sanctification.</p><p>Some Christians have a natural concept concerning sanctification. They think that sanctification is Christ coming to us and helping us become holy. What they are really saying is that they are not holy and that Christ is helping them to become holy. However, 1 Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ Jesus became to us from God sanctification. We are not sanctified through ourselves or through the help of Christ. Rather, Christ Himself has become our sanctification. Sanctification is in Christ, not in us. Sanctification is the person of Christ, not the help of Christ.</p><p>Other Christians think that sanctification is Christ giving us the power to become sanctified. Actually, man can never be sanctified, and God has no intention to give man the power to become sanctified. God's Word tells us clearly that Christ Jesus became to us from God sanctification. Our sanctification is a gift, a person, not the result of some kind of empowering. Only those who have seen this revelation can tell the difference between these two things. Only they can see the great distance between them. This revelation is not something that one can fathom with his mind. We must ask God to show us something; we must see that Christ did not come to help us to be holy. Neither did He come to give us the power to be holy. Rather, Christ Himself has become our sanctification.</p><p>Many Christians think that with sanctification there is a need for the power of sanctification on the one hand and a need to bear the fruit of sanctification on the other hand. They think that they will produce the fruit of sanctification if they have the power of sanctification. But where do they place Christ in this process? Most people say that Christ is necessary for power, because power will enable us to bear the fruit of sanctification. However, 1 Corinthians 1:30 does not say that Christ is a power to empower us to sanctification. Instead, it says that Christ Himself is our sanctification. We can have sanctification only after we have Christ, and we can have the fruit of sanctification only after we have Christ. Brothers and sisters, we may consider sanctification to be a thing, but God's Word shows us that Christ is that very thing. Our sanctification is a living person&mdash;Christ. Christ is our sanctification.</p><p>Suppose I am a proud person with no humility whatsoever. I can be aware of my pride, but I cannot humble myself. I may pray to God, saying, "Be merciful to me. Lord Jesus, empower me and make me humble." I think that I need the power of humility in order to be humble myself. If Christ helps me and empowers me, I think that I will surely become humble. I pray and ask for help, but this is only my own concept. It is not God's way of salvation. God has not given us the power of humility, but humility itself. God has given us a perfected humility&mdash;Christ. Is the Lord powerful? Of course He is. Has God given us this power? Surely He has. But why are we still so weak? Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that the Lord's power is real, but this power is not accessible to us as a thing. Even if we can be humble and even if we can have a perfect performance, we only have an act of humility at the most. Within us we still do not have humility itself. Humility is Christ Himself, not the power of Christ.</p><p>We should pray, "Lord, You are my humility. God has made You my humility. I ask that You live out Your humility from within me." This is the right attitude. In asking the Lord to be our humility, we should lift up our head and say, "Lord, I have no humility of my own. Be my humility and live out humility on my behalf." If we look to Him in this way, our humility will not be our own. Instead the Lord will become our humility, and our humility will no longer be a conduct, but a living person&mdash;Christ Himself.</p><p>When I was young, I loved to watch slide projection shows at school. After I believed in the Lord, the slide shows became a frequent illustration I used. The light behind the slides never changes, but the slides change all the time. Sometimes the light illuminates scenery, and sometimes it illuminates some kind of atmospheric phenomenon. Sometimes the light illuminates landscapes, and sometimes it illuminates flowers and trees. In the same way all virtues are just the different expressions of Christ being reflected in us. Humility, meekness, and patience are not works that we do; they are virtues of Christ. They are the very human virtues of Christ. In fact, they are just Christ Himself. All the different virtues radiate from the one unchanging life of Christ. These different virtues are produced as a result of the many different kinds of environments. Hence, the virtues of a Christian are not different types of conduct, they are the result of Christ being reflected in him. This is the meaning of Christ being our sanctification.</p><p>We do not need to manufacture a holiness of our own. Rather, we reflect Christ as holiness. Such a revelation and knowledge forms the basis of our Christian life. Many Christians are striving to be humble, obedient, and meek. Little do they realize that they are not producing reflections of Christ, but "products" of their own effort. Actually, none of these virtues can be planned or manufactured.</p><p>When many Christians try to forgive, they pray for the Lord's strength. Then they try to muster their own strength to forgive. Even then they find that they cannot forgive. We have to see that when our forgiveness runs out, we should ask the Lord to be our forgiveness. We should acknowledge that we cannot forgive in ourselves and that there is no forgiveness in us. We should lift up our head and say to the Lord, "I have been wrong. I have tried to be a Christian on my own. I will no longer do this. Lord, I will allow You to live out of me." The whole issue rests with the Lord Himself, not with you.</p>
