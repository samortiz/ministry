   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE COVERING OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 36:8-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 36:8-19 describes the coverings of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The coverings are the safeguard, the protection, of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the coverings, the tabernacle would have had no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It would have been exposed to the sunshine, to the wind, to the rain, and to all kinds of attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, under the covering the tabernacle and all the things within the tabernacle were protected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the coverings are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The tabernacle represents the dwelling place of God, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the covering, the safeguard, the protection, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, this Christ is not objective, but is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christ whom we experience in different ways becomes the protection of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The materials which compose the four layers of the coverings are the protection, the safeguard, of the church, but they all have to be experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we experience the endurance and suffering strength of Christ typified by the porpoise skins, then we will have something to offer to the Lord as the material to compose such a covering to protect the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not experience Christ in such a way, there will be no protection or safeguard for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though Christ in Himself is able to protect the church, we have to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we experience Christ, then He will be the protection of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we experience the endurance and the suffering strength and energy of Christ, the more the church will be protected and safeguarded by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FINE TWINED LINEN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Exodus 36 there were four layers of coverings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first layer was a covering made of fine twined linen v. 8 . Being twined indicates that the linen was doubled in strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Linen in type represents the righteousness which is Christ Himself 1 Cor 1:30; Rev 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ Himself is our righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the sinless One, the One who has no sin and who knows no sin 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the righteous One, He Himself is our righteousness in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, this righteousness is double in strength, as indicated by the word twined.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The curtains were linen and of blue, purple, and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Blue represents heavenliness, purple represents the kingship, the authority, and scarlet represents redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition, according to Exodus 36:8, the curtains were embroidered with cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Cherubim, in the Scriptures, are related to God s glory, God s building, and God s creation Exo 25:20; Heb 9:5; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>10:3-5, 18-19; Rev 4:6-7; 5:8, 13; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, they represent the glory of God manifested in the human nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first layer of the coverings was ten curtains of fine twined linen in two sections of five curtains each, coupled together Exo 36:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This corresponds to the Ten Commandments of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Ark of the Testimony, which was under the coverings, there were two tablets, and five commandments were written on each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows us that the righteous One, who is Christ Himself, corresponds absolutely with the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What the law of God requires, Christ meets to the full extent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ, the righteous One, meets all the requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The number ten, divided into two groups of five, signifies responsibility in fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ten virgins in Matthew 25 are divided into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Five is composed of four, representing man as the leading one of the creation, and one, representing God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man plus God the Creator becomes five, indicating that man added with God bears responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ, the righteous One, bore the full responsibility to fulfill the requirement of the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Exodus 36:9 says, The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain, four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Twenty-eight is composed of eight plus twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The number eight represents resurrection Matt 28:1; John 20:1 the first day of the week is the eighth day .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Twenty is composed of two times ten.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Two represents a testimony, and ten, as we have pointed out, indicates full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here is the testimony of the full responsibility which Christ has borne.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Twenty is also composed of four times five, showing that Christ is the One in creation Col 1:15 who bears all the responsibility to fulfill the requirement of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Twenty-eight may also be composed of four, representing the creature, times seven, representing perfection and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ, who is the righteous One, and who is our righteousness before God, took the full responsibility as the One in creation to fulfill the requirement of God s law completely, to its perfection, that is, to its completion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Each curtain was four cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the ten curtains were of the total width of ten times four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These forty cubits covered the thirty cubit length of the tabernacle, leaving a ten cubit overhang at the rear, the west side.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ten and four signify that Christ, the righteous One, is the complete, perfect creature in full.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Besides all these numbers two, four, five, seven, eight, and ten there is also the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The curtains were twenty-eight cubits long, while the tabernacle was thirty cubits long and ten cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the curtains were placed lengthwise across the top of the tabernacle, they covered the ten cubit width on top, leaving nine cubits hanging on the north and south sides.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This nine is composed of three times three.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The basic numbers of the curtains are three, four, five, and seven, because these are the basic numbers of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Three represents the Triune God in resurrection, four represents the creatures, five represents man plus God to take responsibility, and seven represents perfection and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The dwelling place of God is man mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This dwelling place is built up by man in the Triune God bearing the full responsibility.</S>
