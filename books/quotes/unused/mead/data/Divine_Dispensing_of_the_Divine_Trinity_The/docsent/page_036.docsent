   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As the First and the Last</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John s writing he touches the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With the divine things there is no beginning and no ending because whatever is divine is eternal, having no beginning and no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that John purposely wrote his books using these kinds of expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He had an intention to show us that whatever he ministered to us is eternal, with no beginning and no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So he told us that Christ is the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the first and He is the last Rev 2:8; 22:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because He is the first, no one and nothing is before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because He is the last, no one and nothing is after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ as the eternal One may be illustrated by a circle which has no beginning and no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ occupies everything and every place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not give you any position.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are nothing, and He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the first and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is also for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Beginning and the End</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is not only the first and the last, but also the beginning and the end Rev 22:13c .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may be the first, and yet not be the origination.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the Origination and the Completion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Beginning of God s Creation</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is also the beginning of God s creation Rev 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to realize that God s dispensing is to dispense His life into His creature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who originated the creature?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that the entire creation is under His control, His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the Beginning, the Origination of God s entire creation, so the entire creation is under His direction for the purpose of dispensing God into His chosen creatures.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For Christ to dispense life, He must be the living One.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the Faithful and True Witness</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the faithful and true Witness Rev 3:14b .</S>
