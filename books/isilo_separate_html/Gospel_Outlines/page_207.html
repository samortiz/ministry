<h1 class="title">THE WATER OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rev. 7:17; 21:6; 22:1, 17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The fountain of life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is the fountain of life.</li>
	<li>This fountain issues from the Son of God. God is in His Son Jesus Christ as the fountain of life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The water of the fountain of life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The water of the fountain of life is the life of God.</li>
	<li>This water of life is flowing out of God&rsquo;s Son to be received by man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The function of the water of life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As water is for quenching thirst, so also is the water of life. It quenches the thirst of human living.</li>
	<li>Water is not only for quenching thirst, but also for enjoyment. So also is the water of life to man. It not only quenches man&rsquo;s thirst, but also gives man eternal enjoyment.</li>
	<li>The water of life also delivers man from death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to obtain the water of life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To obtain water you must drink.</li>
	<li>You do not need to pay any price because it is freely given by God. Everyone can drink freely.</li>
	<li>To drink freely is not to depend on your works, but simply to believe and receive.</li>
	</ol></li>
