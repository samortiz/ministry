<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Table</h2>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting it would be good to select some good messages on life and on the life supply according to your study and memory. I call these nourishing messages to bring in a certain amount of nourishment to all the dear saints who come to remember the Lord. After the remembrance rendered to the Lord, a half an hour can be spared in the meeting to speak that short, nourishing message. I believe that everyone will receive the nourishment. I have gone to some Lord&rsquo;s table meetings where this was practiced, and I must testify that I received much nourishment. Therefore, I have the assurance that this can nourish people. I did not speak anything. I sat there and listened to the speaking of those two or three pages and I got fully nourished. I have the assurance that no one who speaks something could render such a good, brief, crucial, and important word to the saints. This message is composed of selected excerpts from our publications. This is the line of nourishment for the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prayer Meeting</h2>
<p>Then you should also select some spiritual messages from our publications on another line&mdash;the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service. At the end of each prayer meeting take half an hour to speak a short article on the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service. Do not despise small things. For the long run this will be very profitable. The saints will receive enlightenment through the speaking of some messages on the spiritual principles of the Lord&rsquo;s service every week. Those who attend the Lord&rsquo;s table will also receive some nourishing messages week by week throughout the year.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Feeding the Saints Patiently and Regularly</h2>
<p>To raise up children, you cannot feed them with all the food they need for twenty years. You have to feed them a little bit at a time, meal after meal, day after day. It takes a long time to raise up a child. Therefore, the elders should learn this way with patience. Do not expect to get things done once for all or overnight. We are not the Creator. The Creator can say, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; but we cannot do that. For us it takes time, especially in the matter of building up the church, which is altogether a matter in life. We need to take time to feed the saints with these messages in a proper way and to do it patiently and regularly year after year, always with some fresh prayer, seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The principles are right and the application may be fresh if you have much prayer. The Lord will lead you to have a fresh way to apply all these principles, and what you do will be quite living. This is what the elders should do. It is not hard because you have a very rich store of groceries.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Writing the Ministry Office for Permission</h2>
<p>We have fellowshipped that for the prayer meeting, the home meeting, and the Lord&rsquo;s table, we need to cook a living message. This can be done by taking excerpts from different books and messages of our publications to make one short message. Everyone who wants to use the materials from Living Stream Ministry in such a way should write to the ministry office for permission. Your application should make it clear that you want to use the material for the purpose of the church meetings. The office will then give you a written answer with directions on how to give the proper credit for the material.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Laboring in the Word</h2>
<p>The elders need to labor in the Word. I cannot eat for you, and there is no shortcut way to get the spiritual food into your being. The elders need to come together with some helpers and some full-timers to get into all the publications and prepare material for the meetings. If you are a teacher, you must spend much time to prepare your own materials. Then you can teach the students in the most effective way because you first got into the material. You must labor. Do not try to save any time in your labor. If you save one minute, you lose one percent. Saving ten minutes is to lose ten percent. The saving of time in your labor is actually a real loss. I spent hours and hours writing the notes for the Recovery Version. I spent approximately one week composing note 6<sup>6</sup> in 1 John 1 concerning the word truth. You cannot put a big piece of salmon on the table for people to eat without cooking it. I digested what Kittel had to say concerning the word truth and then I composed the note on truth with eight items. To take care of the church the elders need to labor in the Word. There is no shortcut way or no convenience you can take. The more you work on something, the better product you get.</p>
<p>You need to get into all the messages and digest all the portions. Out of your digestion you can make a message. This is the best and most prevailing way. Use your time and do your best to labor. You may not have that much time, but use what time you have, trying your best to do something. It is much more prevailing if you digest portions of the written ministry and then put these excerpts together to make a message.</p>
<p>When I say digest, this does not mean that you have to change. Do not recompose. Just put the excerpts together. When I say for you to digest, that means that you really get into the real meaning of that portion. Then you know which portions to choose. I do not mean to digest and recompose. I do not agree with that. I do not have the confidence that you can do something better. I believe that after your recomposing, all the good flavor in my writings will be gone. Note 26<sup>1</sup> in 1 Corinthians 14 tastes so sweet; the color is beautiful and the material is rich. You could not get anything to compare with that, so please do not recompose my writings.</p>
