   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A BELIEVER S ATTITUDE TOWARD ILLNESS A. Discovering the Cause of an Illness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A believer should first go before the Lord to discover the cause of his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He should not hastily seek healing as soon as he becomes ill.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consider the process a person goes through in an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever a person has an illness, the first thing he should do is to discover the cause of the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was clear about his own illness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This sets a good pattern for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God wants us to be clear about the cause of our illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to ask whether or not we have disobeyed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have we sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have we come short of others?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have we acted against some natural laws?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have we been negligent in certain matters?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Often our offense against natural laws is an offense against God, because these laws were created and ordained by God; God rules the universe through these natural laws.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is always a reason for our illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. Not Anxiously Seeking a Doctor</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people are afraid that they will die as soon as they become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They immediately look for a doctor after they become ill and anxiously look forward to their healing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This should not be a believer s attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person first must find out the cause of his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many brothers and sisters have no patience at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first thing they do when they are ill is to look for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They hastily find a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are afraid that they will lose their precious lives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, they pray as if they trust in God for their healing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, they rush to the doctor for medicine and injections.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are afraid, and they treasure their own lives very much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows us clearly that they are fully obsessed with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are too self-centered during ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they become sick, they become even more self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is impossible for a man to be full of the self at ordinary times yet be free from the self when he is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who are full of self at ordinary times will surely anxiously seek healing when they are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. First Dealing with One s Problem before God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can assure you of the futility of such anxiety about your sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Being healed is not that simple in the case of a person who belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if you are healed, your sickness may come back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In addition, other kinds of illnesses may come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must first take care of your problem with God before you can settle the problem of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A problem of the body cannot be resolved if a problem before God is not resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must first discover the cause of your sickness before God and then seek healing afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You must learn the lesson that comes along with your illness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even in the case of a sudden severe illness, you must not ignore this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you deal with God in this way, He will intervene for you and will deliver you out of your woe in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Very often we find that we are sick because we have sinned or have committed some mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must confess to the Lord and ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only then can we expect any healing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we advance a little further in God, we may realize that there is not only sin but also Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At times sickness may be a matter of God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He disciplines us in order that we would become more sanctified, tender, and obedient before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There can be many reasons for our sicknesses, and we have to deal with them one by one before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we deal with them one by one, we will discover the actual cause of our illness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes God allows help to come from natural means or from medicine, but at other times, God may not want us to receive help from medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He can heal us in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>D. Learning to Look to God as the Healer</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to realize that healing is always in God s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to learn to look to the God who heals!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Old Testament God has a name: For I am Jehovah who healeth thee Exo 15:26, New Translation .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This name of God is a verb; it is a very special name.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to learn to look to Jehovah, the One who heals.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He will always deal graciously with His children.</S>
