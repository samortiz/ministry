<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Everyone Left from All the Nations<br>That Went Forth against Jerusalem<br>Going Up from Year to Year<br>to Worship the King, Jehovah of Hosts,<br>and to Keep the Feast of Tabernacles</H2><P>Everyone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles (v. 16). Whoever does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there will be no rain, but there will be the plague with which Jehovah strikes the nations. This will be their sin (vv. 17-19). Because the present age is the age of grace, God sends rain on the just and the unjust alike (Matt. 5:45). But the coming age will be the age of righteousness. Those who do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles will not receive rain. This is righteous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Holiness to Jehovah of Hosts</H2><P>In the millennium, on the horses' bells will be, "Holiness to Jehovah"; and the pots in the house of Jehovah will be like the basins before the altar (Zech. 14:20). The pots are something small, and the basins are something large. But in the millennium the pots in the house of God will be as large as the basins before the altar. Indeed every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holiness to Jehovah of hosts; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them; and there will never again be a Canaanite (or, merchant) in the house of Jehovah of hosts in that day (v. 21). This is Israel's destiny in the millennium.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A COMPARISON OF TWO MAIN CATEGORIES OF THINGS<br>IN THE BOOKS OF DANIEL AND ZECHARIAH</H2><P>Let us now go on to make a comparison of two main categories of things in the books of Daniel and Zechariah.</P>
