Please read the preceding answer to the question concerning sects, especially the part about having names. The building which we use for meetings does not need a name to differentiate itself, because the church of God is God's children, not the house they use to meet in. The building that is used for meetings is not the temple of God. We are the temple of God. God does not dwell in the building we meet in. He dwells in us (1 Cor. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Pet. 2:5).</P><P>Finally, dear brother! We do not talk about these matters because we naturally like to be critical of others, repudiate the errors of others, or be contentious about words. Moreover, we do not leave the denominations because we are proud and arrogant in our natural selves, wanting to be leaders and not willing to be restricted by others; nor is it because we are naturally stubborn and like to be individuals away from the crowd. The reason we speak about the error of denominations and leave them is because denominations are condemned by God; they are the fruit of the flesh, and they are of the old man. We leave the denominations because the flesh and the old man have already been crucified on the cross (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 6:6), because God wants us to put off the old man (Eph. 4:22), and because we want to please God, to deal with the flesh, and put off the old man. If we leave the denominations because we have argued with someone, or if we only leave the denominations and do not deal with the flesh or put off the old man, it is worthless before God! If we leave the denominations because we want to put on the new man, deal with the flesh, and put off the old man to pursue the riches of spiritual life and to manifest the Body of Christ, then that is very precious before God! May God bless us. I bless you with peace!</P><P>Your brother in Christ,<br>Witness Lee for Watchman Nee<br>February 4, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES<br>(END OF APRIL 1934)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Nan Shu Chou</H2><P>Our sister Miao Yun Chun met with the sisters in Nan Shu Chou for twenty days last month and the beginning of this month. The first eight days were for preaching the gospel. More than thirty were clearly saved. The last twelve days continued with teaching Bible Studies for Beginners. More than twenty attended to be taught. Nineteen received the truth, believed, and obeyed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Ling Tzu</H2><P>A conference was scheduled for sisters beginning on April 14. There was gospel preaching in the mornings, and the sisters had fellowship in the afternoons. Although there were only between twenty and thirty who came to the conference, some repented and gained life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Tsinan</H2><P>Two brothers, Chang Kuang Jung and Chou Hsin Yi, are now in Tsinan. This month (April) the meeting moved to 1 Nan Chieh Chia, Kan Shih Ch'iao, Nan Kuan, Tsinan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Soochow</H2><P>Our brother Stephen Kaung preached the gospel a number of times at the Anglo-Chinese Girls' School. Thank the Lord, some have been clearly saved. The meetings in Soochow have been greatly attacked by opposers over the past month. Our brothers and sisters can only endure the many misunderstandings and slanderings. The Lord is the Victor! Recently, the wind and the waves have become much calmer. Furthermore, there is a group of Western missionaries who can understand our brothers and sisters even though they themselves cannot walk the same way together with them. Our two sisters (Tso and Ku) do not know about the future. Presently, the director of the Gospel Hospital and the Western missionary board are doing their best to try to keep them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO</H2><P>(1) Whoever has any news of the work, the difficulties, things to pray for, or other news, please send them as often as possible.</P><P>(2) All news should in principle be detailed, true, clear, and edifying.
