   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Testimony Being Different</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from That of the Jews</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our testimony differs from that of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today the Jews are God's people, and the Gentiles are also God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we refrain from eating some things, we are saying that the Jews are God's people but that we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The commandment today is to rise up, slay, and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should no longer just eat clean things and refrain from eating unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What God considers clean, we must not consider unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We eat both the clean and the unclean to testify to the fact that both the Jews and the Gentiles are now God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament, only clean things were eaten, which meant that only the Israelites were God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was right to eat only one kind of food during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also right to eat both kinds today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we are not standing on the ground of Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we stand on the ground that the Gentiles and the Jews have received grace together and that God has abolished all distinctions between them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our food is a testimony to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. Not Eating Things Sacrificed to Idols</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fourth, 1 Corinthians has much to say concerning things sacrificed to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Corinthians 8 tells us that idols mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is God, and idols are just vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To those who are advanced in knowledge, it is all right to eat things sacrificed to idols since idols are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There may be evil spirits behind the idols, but God is much greater than the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He who dwells in us is greater than he who is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, many new believers worshipped idols in the temple in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They had dealings with the idols, and they are ignorant of the meaning of fellowship with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they see someone who has knowledge eating in the temple, they will think that they can do the same as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The conduct may be the same, but the condition of the heart may be different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You eat because you realize that idols are vanity, but it is wrong for them to eat, because in their hearts the idols are something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may cause them to sin if you are careless about your eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 8 that it is better for believers not to eat things sacrificed to idols, because this will stumble the weak brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is better not to eat such things at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul considered those who ate only vegetables to be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But 1 Corinthians says that it is better to refrain from things offered to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to catch the emphasis of the writer here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's children must know that idols are vanity and nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But they should not cause others to be stumbled through them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This being the case, it is better not to eat things sacrificed to idols at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This principle has nothing to do with demons; it has to do with the weak brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many are concerned about the demons; they are the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not eat because we do not want to stumble our brothers, not because of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan has no power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Idols have no power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not afraid of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But before God we must learn to care for our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not eat because I do not want to stumble my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>E. Personal Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally, I will give a word of personal opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eating means a great deal in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should keep this significance in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Food Being for the Sake of Nourishing the Body</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Food, like clothing, is governed by certain principles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first principle concerning food is that it is for the nourishment of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should eat more of that which nourishes and less of that which does not nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should never make the belly our god or spend too much energy on food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As God's children, we must realize that food is for the nourishment of the body and for the preservation of our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Contentment and Addition</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's children should be content with food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The birds of heaven do not sow, neither do they reap, yet God feeds them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This has to do with eating.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The lilies of the field toil not, neither do they spin, yet they are better clothed than Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This has to do with clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everything is in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today we need only to seek God's kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to us Matt 6:26-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I like the word added.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What is the meaning of added?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If I ask, "How much is three plus zero?" you would say, "It does not make sense to add zero to three.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It makes no sense to add zero to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Zero plus three is redundant."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What can you add to a number?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It only makes sense to add a positive number to something.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For example, you can add one to three.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You should seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This means that to those who have God's kingdom and His righteousness, God will add food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters will seek God's kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To those who have God's kingdom and who live in God's righteousness, the rest will be added to them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I hope that God's children will know how to maintain a proper testimony among men in the matter of clothing and food.</S>
