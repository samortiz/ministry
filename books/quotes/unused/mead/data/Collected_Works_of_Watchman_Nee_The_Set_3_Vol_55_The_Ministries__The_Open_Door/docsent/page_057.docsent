   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHRISTIAN'S OCCUPATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After God created man, He gave Adam and Eve the occupation of caring for the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After man fell, God's ordination was that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later Abel was a herdsmen, and Cain was a farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the human race multiplied, different skilled tradesmen developed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, men like Abraham, Jacob, and the Israelites were either farmers or herdsmen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows us that God's desire is for man to be in a farming or ranching profession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should produce things by our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the New Testament the Lord often gave parables about sowers and shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most of the twelve apostles were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was a maker of tents, and Luke was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These all show us the following basic principle: Production through labor increases the quantity or value of the commodity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It takes things from nature and adds labor and strength to give them value.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Farming and ranching increase the quantity of a commodity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tent making increases the value of a commodity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Laboring and practicing medicine require effort and time for wages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A proper occupation for a Christian must be one which requires labor and is productive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone knows that commerce comes from Satan it begins in Tyre and culminates in Babylon Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>28; Rev 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its end is judgment and condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, Christians should not be engaged in pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Buying and selling which does not increase the quantity or value of the commodity but only makes a profit through the trade is pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pure commerce has only one thought in mind making money off of people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, it is easy to become evil in heart and in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not easy to be delivered from money, either.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we want to serve God, we cannot engage in such professions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must see that a producer takes something from nature, not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A laborer does not take anything from nature, nor does he take anything from man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person engaged in commerce, however, does not take anything from nature, but takes from man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our principle is that we must expend energy to earn money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must increase in physical riches, not in money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we hope that the brothers and sisters would do their best to avoid engaging in pure commerce and to find occupations that require labor in production.</S>
