   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN AUTHORITY DOES NOT DOMINATE OR CONTROL, BUT HUMBLES HIMSELF TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, the Lord talked about authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 41 says that when the other ten disciples heard about James and John's request, they became indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It appears that James and John asked the Lord in secret, but later the ten disciples found this out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Subsequently, the Lord taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here is the subject of the whole passage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He gathered the disciples around and taught them things concerning the future glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said, "You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But it is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be the slave of all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>42-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two disciples' question led to a discussion on authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord told them that the issue is not with the future but with today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spirit of this subject is applicable not only to future glory but also to today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord introduced the spirit that will be applicable from that day until the present.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here were two persons who wanted to sit on the throne to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord showed them that among the Gentiles, there are those who are esteemed as rulers and great ones who lord it over them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among the Gentiles there is the hunger for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Men like to be kings; they like to rule over others or to be great ones to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But it is not so among us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is good if some among us seek for future glory, but such ones should not have the thought of lording it over God's children today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They should not have the thought of controlling or ruling others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is nothing wrong for man to want to sit on the Lord's right or left side.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there should not be any striving for supremacy among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There should not be any thought of struggle for power or any intention of controlling others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do, we will fall into the same condition as that of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nothing is more unsightly than a person who struggles to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the most ugly thing for a person to try to control others in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ambition for authority or to be a great one is something that belongs to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should drive this kind of spirit from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord can only use those who know His cup and who are willing to be baptized with His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we drink His cup and take His baptism, authority will be ours spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the God-ordained way, the root of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not take this way yet try to reach our destination, or if we do not have the root yet try to produce fruit, we are trying in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must abound in our knowledge of God's will and must accept all the breakings so that the life within can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As far as our position before God is concerned, it is up to God's preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If anyone wants to climb above other children of God, or if he wants to take control and rule, I will say that such a one is a Gentile in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must first drive out this Gentile spirit from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Among us, we should not tolerate the spirit of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are after those whom God can use, not those who can rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a Gentile spirit must be thoroughly purged from us before we can go down from this mountain to help others or handle business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more a person wants to be an authority or a great one, the less we can entrust him with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God never grants authority to those who want to be His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more Gentile spirit a person has, the less God can use him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope none of us are politicians, manipulating, controlling, and hushing others, while allowing only ourselves to be the ones to issue the orders.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more a person realizes his foibles, the more authority God will give to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since this is how the Lord selects men, this is the way we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must never be a politician and must never play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should never say, "If we do not give this man some position, he will rebel against us."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot deal with others this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In God's house we can only take the spiritual way according to the spiritual principle; we cannot take the way of politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that you will be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You should be meek and pliable in your attitude, but you have to be faithful before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man can only be used by God after he has prostrated himself before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a man is standing tall, God can never use him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verses 42 and 43 the Lord said that the Gentiles have rulers and great men to rule over them, but "it is not so among you."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I like the words among you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that there is a great difference between the Gentiles and the church in the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are not careful in this matter, we will have no way to go on in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Gentiles rule according to position, but the church serves according to its spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once the church is contaminated with this Gentile practice, it is ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church has to maintain a strict separating wall between it and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Among the Gentiles, one only sees power struggles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Among us, the more a person thinks that he is authority, the less he is qualified to be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more a person thinks he is qualified, the less he is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should maintain this attitude among us at all times.</S>
