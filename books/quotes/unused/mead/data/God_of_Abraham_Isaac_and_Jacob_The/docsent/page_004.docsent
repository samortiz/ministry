   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham's original name was Abram.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later God changed his name to Abraham Gen 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within both of these two names is the root Abra, which in the original language means "father."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abraham was a father himself, and the lesson he learned was to know God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout his whole life, he learned this one lesson knowing God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does it mean to know God as the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means that everything is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not say, "My God is working until now," but "My Father is working until now."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For God to be the Father means that God is the Creator, the unique Initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Son was sent from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner" v. 19 . This must be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must receive grace from God to realize that we cannot initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not worthy of initiating anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 1 begins by saying, "In the beginning God..."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the beginning it was not us, but God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is the Father, and everything originates from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The day that God shows you that He is the Father will be a blessed day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On that day you will realize that you cannot do anything and that you are helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You will not have to try to hold yourself back from doing this thing or that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead you will ask, "Has God initiated this?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the experience of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His experience shows us that he had no thought of becoming God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham did not initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was God who initiated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was God who brought him from the other side of the Euphrates River Gen 12:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God wanted him, and He called him out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abraham never thought of this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God wanted him and God did the work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham did not volunteer to go to the land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God said it first, and then Abraham went and possessed it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not know anything about it beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he was called to go out, he did not know where he was going Heb 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He left his father's land without knowing where he was going.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God was the Initiator of everything for him; he had nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you know that God is the Father, you will not be so confident and will not say that you can do whatever you want.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will only say, "If the Lord is willing, I will do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever the Lord says, I will do."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean that you should be indecisive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It means that you truly do not know what to do and that you only know after the Father has revealed His will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was not all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Abraham did not know that he was going to beget a son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He even had to receive his son from God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham could not initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His son was given to him by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Abraham knew God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of knowledge is not a knowledge in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a knowledge in which one is brought to the point of confessing, "God, I am not the source.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are the source of everything, and You are my source.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without You, I cannot have a beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not have Abraham's realization, we cannot be God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first lesson we have to learn is to realize that we can do nothing and that everything depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Father, and He is the Initiator of everything.</S>
