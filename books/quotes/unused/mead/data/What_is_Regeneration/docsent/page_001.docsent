   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT IS REGENERATION?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's salvation is exceedingly full and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It includes forgiveness and cleansing of sins, redemption from the demands of the law, reconciliation to God, sanctification, justification, freedom from bondage, regeneration, and much more!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of all these aspects of salvation, only regeneration is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is by regeneration that the very life of God is imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE CENTER OF THE EXPERIENCE OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regeneration is the center of the experience of salvation, because God's central purpose in saving us is that we may have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is for this that He has forgiven our sins and cleansed us; it is for this that He has sanctified and justified us; it is for this that He has set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has accomplished all these things for one purpose to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regeneration, therefore, is the central part of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By regeneration we begin to experience the very life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we were regenerated, we had no dealings with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now we have many experiences of the life of God because the moment we were regenerated, His life came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BORN OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that he needed to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his ministry, John the Baptist told people that they had to repent and to realize that they were sinful and were good for nothing except burial.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who heard John's preaching and repented were baptized in water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This meant that, as sinful, fallen men of the old creation, they were being terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Repentance and baptism with water was the central point of John the Baptist's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what it means to be born of water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regeneration, then, is to terminate people of the old creation with all their deeds and to germinate them in the new creation with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a sinner who is good for nothing except burial, he is accepting John's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After repenting, he must believe in the Lord Jesus and accept His ministry of life in order to be germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For salvation, we need both repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is what it means to be born of water and of the Spirit, and this is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John told people that his ministry was for the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The termination of our old life is for the germination of His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The center of the ministry of the Lord Jesus is the Spirit, that is, to germinate people with a new life in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Born of water and the Spirit" does not imply regeneration through or by means of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While the Bible does speak of being saved through water 1 Pet 3:20-21 , it never speaks of regeneration through water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are not equivalent terms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be saved through water mainly refers to being separated from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the time of the flood in Genesis 6 8, Noah and his family were saved from the judgment of God by being in the ark, which is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, they were saved from that perverted and evil generation by the waters of the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The waters terminated that generation, separating and saving Noah and his family from its corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regeneration is also the beginning of the new man within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All our experiences of spiritual life are matters of the new man who begins within us at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before we were regenerated, we were in Adam, a fallen sinner, an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we were regenerated, God's life in Christ entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This life is a new element, and when it mingles with our spirit it becomes the new man within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, every one of us who has been regenerated is a double man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are on the one hand the old, fallen man in Adam, and we are on the other hand the new, regenerated man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BORN OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Bible, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit John 3:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before regeneration our spirit was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"And you, though dead in your offenses and sins" Eph 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But at the time we believed, God's Spirit came into us and mingled with our spirit 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, our spirit obtained God's life and was made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whereas our parents gave us our natural birth, God's Spirit has given us our spiritual birth.</S>
