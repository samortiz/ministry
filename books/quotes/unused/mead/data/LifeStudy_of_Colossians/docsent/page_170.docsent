   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROOTED IN CHRIST TO ABSORB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Further help concerning the practical enjoyment of Christ is found in 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this verse, we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word implies the existence of soil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the rich soil in which we are rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a foregoing message we pointed out that this rich soil contains many marvelous elements: the fullness of the Godhead, the headship of Christ, Christ s circumcision, His burial, being raised up with Christ, the wiping out of the ordinances, and the stripping off of the rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Colossians 2:9-15 is a description of the elements of the soil implied by the words having been rooted in 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are rooted in Christ, who is the rich, fertile soil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having been rooted in Him, we should go on to absorb His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a tree absorbs nourishing elements from the soil through its roots, we also should absorb the riches of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elements absorbed into a tree from the soil enable the tree to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, a tree s growth depends upon the nourishment it absorbs through its roots.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since we have been rooted into Christ, we should remain in Him in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our experience, we need to stay rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we forget Christ in matters such as eating and drinking, we are not rooted in Him in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we eat our food, we may not remember Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After our meal, we may spend some time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But even at the beginning of our prayer, we may not actually and experientially be rooted in Christ, for we may pray many unnecessary things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in His mercy and patience, the Lord waits until we begin to pray in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in our experience we absorb Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, when our time of prayer is finished, it may happen that we do not go on to assimilate what we have absorbed of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the Lord s words in John 15, it could be that we do not abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the morning many saints spend time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, even though they spend a certain amount of time with Him, they may not absorb much of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason is that they are in too much of a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would absorb the riches of Christ into us as our nourishment, we should not be rushed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot absorb anything if we are in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not only absorb the Lord in the morning, but we should be like trees continually absorbing the riches of the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that we must learn to practice the continual enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should let every physical thing be a reminder of Christ, for all these things are shadows of which Christ is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The clothing we put on each day should remind us of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should put Him on in our spirit and by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Drinking a glass of water should remind us to drink Christ by the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To follow this practice is to be rooted in Christ and to absorb His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TENDER ROOTS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would absorb the riches of Christ as the soil, we need to have tender, new roots.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not let yourself get old, but be fresh and renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Pray to the Lord, Lord, I want my consecration to be fresh, and I want to open to You anew.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I want my roots to be tender that I may absorb Your riches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, don t let my roots get old.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our roots are tender and new to absorb the riches of Christ, we shall grow automatically with the riches we assimilate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is to enjoy Christ and to experience Him subjectively daily and hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will keep us from being defrauded of our prize.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we do not remain rooted in Him to absorb His riches, in a subtle way the enemy will defraud us of the practical and continual enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>HEEDING PAUL S WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although there are millions of Christians on earth today, almost all of them have been defrauded of their prize of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They believe in Christ, have received Him, and perhaps have even paid a price to follow Him, but, like the Colossians, they have been deprived of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All Christians, including us, need to heed Paul s warning not to allow anyone to defraud us of our prize.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not allow anyone to carry us away from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the body, the reality, of all the positive things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we enjoy the positive physical things, we should be reminded to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do this, our daily living will be full of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we shall be rooted in Him, absorb His riches, and grow in Him.</S>
