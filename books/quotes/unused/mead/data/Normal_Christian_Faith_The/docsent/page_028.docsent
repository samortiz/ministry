   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BORN OF MARY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps we should read the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are forty-two generations in the genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning from the first generation, it repeatedly says, "So-and-so begot So-and-so."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This phrase is used through verse 15, which says, "And Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 16 continues, "And Jacob begot Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The surprising thing is that the next part of the sentence does not continue with "Joseph begot Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, it says, "Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the line reaches Joseph, the pattern is dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His way of birth was very different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF HIS DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that His method of coming into the world was an unusual one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we want to look at His way of departing from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we shall see, this was also contrary to our ordinary deaths.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one can ever predict the place, time, and manner he or she is going to die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A hundred years from now, all of us here will be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But no one knows how we are going to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus of Nazareth, however, foresaw His own death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He knew exactly when, where, and how it was to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DIED ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once when someone told Him that He was going to be killed, He answered that it was not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem Luke 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knew that He was going to die in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day, He told His disciples that the hour had come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only did He sense the imminence of His death; He told others that His death hour had come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He knew also how He would die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A number of times He mentioned that He would be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was recorded at least three times in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only was this man different in His way of entering into the world, but His manner of departure was no less extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both His birth and His death were very unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is this the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>WITHOUT SIN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us consider the third qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What kind of morality did Jesus of Nazareth have?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Was He the same as we are?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Did He ever sin?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I like the sentence Jesus spoke in John 8.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many were opposing Him at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They surrounded and cross-examined Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In return He asked, "Which of you convicts Me of sin?" v. 46 . This was a tremendous challenge! Which one of us would dare to stand before everyone and challenge to be convicted of sin? Whoever dared do such a thing would be put to shame the minute his wife stood up to testify against him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps, in less than five minutes, seven or eight people would immediately rise up to expose his lies and unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when Jesus made such a statement, no one was able to convict Him of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There has been a countless number of saints and sages throughout the ages, but none was bold enough to claim to be perfect and sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why is it that Jesus alone dared to make such a claim?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All I can say is that this man is either arrogant to the extreme or holy to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A proud person may talk in an outlandish manner because he does not know himself; he has no realization of what kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when Jesus challenged, "Which of you convicts Me," there was no way He could be humble or polite about it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is without sin, and He is holy to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus of Nazareth is not like Confucius, who said that given some more time, he would be rid of big, moral flaws.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus is sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When He made such a statement, He made it before His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there had been a slight misconduct on His part, the Jews would have caught it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Jews are not prolific writers; they have not produced many books other than the Holy Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But after Jesus, many books were written by the Jews to contradict Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these books deny His divinity, but none touch His morality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of all the opposing writings, none can prove that Jesus ever sinned.</S>
