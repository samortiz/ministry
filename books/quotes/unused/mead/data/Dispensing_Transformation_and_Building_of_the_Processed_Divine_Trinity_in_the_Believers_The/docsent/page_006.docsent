   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE DISPENSING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:7, 10-11, 13-14; 4:30 OUTLINE In redemption Eph 1:7: God the Son dispenses His rich life element into the believers' inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Continuing God the Father's dispensing in regeneration and going along with God the Spirit's renewing, which follows God the Father's regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To constitute the believers as God's precious inheritance Eph 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That the believers may take the lead among all things to be headed up in Christ to restore the proper order in God's creation Eph 1:10.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through sealing Eph 1:13-14: Through sealing, God the Spirit strengthens the dispensing of God the Father and God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sealing the believers with the essence of the Triune God in a gentle and fine way to saturate them until their body is redeemed Eph 4:30.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That the believers may bear the image of God as their divine seal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine essence with which the believers are sealed becoming the pledge, guarantee, and foretaste of God as the believers' inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the preceding message we saw that God's highest purpose concerning man is His desire to build Himself into man; that is, He desires to have His divine element wrought into the created man that He and man may have an organic mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this mingling God's element increases more and more in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God's element increases in man, man in the condition of the old creation will be gradually renewed and transformed until he becomes completely the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the new creation?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new creation is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this universe, only God is "new" and everything else is "old."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every person, thing, and matter in the universe is old and is becoming old every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only our God is "new"; He is ever new and never becomes old.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, when we have this God, we become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God does not want us to change ourselves, to make ourselves new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God wants us to receive Him, be filled and saturated with Him, and be permeated by Him, that we may have a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christians know and accept the matter of God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, concerning man becoming God, they consider this as something incredible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some brothers and sisters might have heard and declared this, but within them they may have a question mark concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man becoming God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems that this is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The revelation concerning man becoming God is unacceptable to many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in church history, during the time of the church fathers, the truth concerning God becoming man that man may become God was generally accepted by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But not long afterward the church was distracted from the vision concerning this truth and the economy of God and became more and more degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, today when we speak about man becoming God, people generally feel uncomfortable with it and find it difficult to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today our mind needs to be transformed by being renewed that we may see this truth revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God became man that man may become God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a miracle this is!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a mystery this is!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although our mind cannot comprehend it, we need to simply receive it, and then we will be able to enjoy and experience this fact as our reality.</S>
