Generally speaking, it is not a book of types, figures, and shadows, and neither is it deep in the matter of prophecies
The plain words in the Bible are more difficult to understand than the pictures shown in the types and figures
Literally, Deuteronomy means 'second law' and thus signifies a respeaking, a repeated speaking, a speaking again
The writing of the Bible was completed nineteen hundred years ago, but when we read the Bible today, we experience a respeaking
The claim of Joseph Smith to have had a revelation in addition to what is in the Bible is nonsensical and heretical
We should not think that we can receive a new revelation in addition to what is recorded in the sixty-six books of the Bible
The word has already been spoken, but it can now be respoken to us; that is, it can become to us a deuteronomy
Deuteronomy is an all-inclusive conclusion of the four preceding books, for Deuteronomy is a totality of the thought of these books
In Deuteronomy 8:3 Moses, speaking for God, said that man lives not by bread alone but by 'everything proceeding from Jehovah's mouth'
The words written in the Pentateuch, of which Deuteronomy is the conclusion, are things which have proceeded out of the mouth of God
For the psalmist, whatever came out of God's mouth was not only something legal but something sweet to his taste
Because all Scripture is Godbreathed even verses such as Genesis 31 and Revelation 202 and 3 can supply nourish strengthen and enlighten us
From this we see that we can be nourished and enlightened by any verse in the Bible, including the genealogy in Matthew 1
Nor is it across the sea that you should say, Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it'?
In verse 14 Moses says, 'The word is very near to you, even in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it'
In verses 6 and 7 Paul says The righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way Do not say in your heart Who will ascend into heaven
In his interpretation Paul applies the word in Deuteronomy 30:11-13 to Christ, and he interprets the sea as the abyss
In Paul's interpretation of Deuteronomy 30, we see that the word is the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ
Since this message is on Deuteronomy, we would emphasize the fact that the word in this book is Christ as our life and life supply
On the one hand, Christ is the good land; on the other hand, He is the food which sustains us on the way to the good land
As the Instructor and Leader of God's people, Christ enables them to enter into the heavenly territory and participate in His riches
The valleys and mountains signify the different kinds of environments in which we may experience Christ as the flowing Spirit
The good land is a land flowing with milk and honey, both of which are the produce of a combination of the animal life and the plant life
Moses tells us over and over again that if we love the Lord our God and obey His commandments, we will receive His blessing
Nor is it across the sea that you should say, Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it'?
Verse 14 goes on to say, 'But the word is very near to you, even in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it'
In order to have such an understanding of 30:11-14, we need to study Paul's quotation and interpretation of these verses in Romans 10:6-8
Romans 10:6 says, 'The righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?
Revelation 9 indicates that Antichrist will come out of the abyss, and Revelation 13 tells us that Antichrist will come out of the sea
Paul's point in Romans 10:7 is that in His resurrection Christ came up from the abyss, came up from among the dead
After Christ died on the cross, He went to the abyss, to the region of death and of the satanic power of darkness
We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has opened our eyes to understand Deuteronomy 30:11-14 in the way Paul did
Now we see that these verses show us the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ who has become the life- giving Spirit
Eventually because Paul was a man constituted with God his opinion became a part of Gods word as the divine revelation in the New Testament
He was a person not only soaked and saturated with the thought of God but also constituted with the speaking God Himself
If we get into the depth of this book, we will realize that God's dealing with His people here is a kind of governmental administration
Because Moses knew Gods governmental administration and was experienced in it he was qualified to do the respeaking recorded in Deuteronomy
He should be one who loves God, fears God, subjects himself to God's ruling, minds the bowels of God, and lives in the presence of God
When we hear about the kind of persons we must be to inherit the good land, we may feel that we cannot make it
If this is our feeling, we need to be reminded that the book of Deuteronomy is a book full of the word which is Christ
The inheritors needed to match the Giver of the inheritance, so that He could be with them both in their living and in their fighting
The intention of this book is not to point out man's history but to point out man's past errors that man may be adjusted
In spite of our failure in loving God and fearing Him and in spite of our unfaithfulness, God will be successful
Eventually, God's chosen and redeemed people entered into the holy land, possessed it, lived in it, and enjoyed it
The nine crucial points in the book of Deuteronomy covered in the foregoing message reveal three persons: God, man, and Christ as the word
As the wise God, He knows that we love ourselves and that we are righteous in our own careless way and for our own benefit
It would be ridiculous to think that this kind of person can carry out God's eternal purpose or fulfill His economy
Paul's writings also manifest God as the One who is loving, righteous, and faithful and as the God of blessing
Whatever Christ is and has and whatever Christ has done, is doing, will do, and can do are embodied in the Bible
Since the Bible is God's breath, God's exhaling, the best way to study the Bible is to breathe it, to inhale it
Christ as the word has already come down in His incarnation, and He has already come out of the abyss, out of Hades, in His resurrection
If we breathe the processed Triune God, the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit will be with us
If we would have this experience, we need to enjoy the Divine Trinity by inhaling the Bible, the embodiment of Christ
If we would have this light and revelation, we need to be in the presence of the Lord as we are reviewing our past
If we view our past in the presence of the Lord, He may give us new light and new revelation according to what we were in the past
Reviewing the past helps us to know ourselves, to condemn the flesh, and to learn to reject the self and the flesh
While we were doing certain things or passing through certain things in the past, it was difficult for us to know ourselves
Afterwards when we look back, we can receive light to know ourselves and our flesh so that we may reject the self and the flesh
Our review of the past must be governed by the thought that God's heart is loving and that His governmental dealing is righteous
Obedience and faithfulness are the two conditions that must be fulfilled if we are to be qualified to receive God's blessing
If we want God's blessing in our private life, daily life, family life, and church life, we must learn to be obedient and faithful
To turn away from God and from His word, which is Christ, is to lose all the blessings and to suffer the curse
If we would journey with God and fight for Him today, we must be equipped with the revelation concerning Christ and the church
We see the revelation concerning Christ and the church and then we participate in the present building up of God's dwelling place on earth
In addition to the building up of the tabernacle, there was the building up of the priesthood for the service of God
The children of Israel were also formed, or constituted, into an army to journey with God and to fight with God
The children of Israel, therefore, had a threefold status: they were the dwelling place, the priesthood, and the army
There are millions of Christians today who have not received the proper equipping, that is, who have not been trained and perfected
These Christians have not been built up as the dwelling place and as the priesthood and have not been formed into an army to fight for God
In order to journey with God under His heavenly leading, we must first be equipped, built up, and formed into an army
God charged the children of Israel to leave the mount of God that they might enter the good land which He promised to their fathers
The appointing of officers indicates that it was not easy to keep the condition of the children of Israel in a good order
The people were more than two million in number, and it was not possible for Moses alone to keep them in order
The failure of the children of Israel at Kadesh-barnea was due to their unbelief toward God and toward His promise
With respect to believing in God we should forget our past, but with respect to knowing God and ourselves we should remember our past
We must learn to reject the self and the flesh and put our trust altogether in God, the One who is faithful and whose words can never fail
From Genesis to Revelation, the entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ
Verse 14a says, 'The time that we spent in going from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years'
The purpose of these years of wandering was to consume man's flesh and unbelief and to manifest God's mercy and blessing
On the one hand, these were wasted years; on the other hand, these years were useful in consuming their flesh and unbelief
In the years of wandering, God had mercy on His people and blessed them, even though they were fleshly and full of unbelief
Because we are so far away from God and because our situation is so poor, God's grace cannot reach us unless He first has mercy upon us
As those who are now under God's mercy, we should also pray for God's blessing, saying, 'Lord, we do not trust in what we can do
Finally, these thirty-eight years were used by God to produce a new generation for the fulfilling of God's purpose
Because Moses had witnessed the consuming of the first generation, he might have sighed deeply as he spoke the words recorded in chapter two
In 2:24 3:22 Moses spoke about the defeating of King Sihon and King Og and the taking possession of their lands east of the Jordan
It was not a small matter for the children of Israel to defeat these kings and to take possession of their lands
After the children of Israel defeated Sihon and Og, they took possession of their lands, which were east of the Jordan
In Numbers 20 Moses had made a serious mistake, a mistake which God could not tolerate because it touched His administration
Moses charged the children of Israel to keep God's statutes and judgments, especially not to make idols and worship them
The commandments are the basic law, the details of the law are the statutes, and the statutes with judgments are ordinances
Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations to which Jehovah will drive you'
After the foregoing review of the past, Moses took thought concerning the manslayer who slew his neighbor without intent
He is the wheat, which signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ, and the barley, which signifies the resurrected Christ
The book of Deuteronomy unveils Christ as the life with the strength and ability to reach the God-appointed goal
In the book of Deuteronomy, as in the Bible as a whole, God is manifested, man is exposed, and Christ is unveiled
Since the Bible fully exposes us, when we come to the Bible, it is also easy for us to see what we are and where we are
In order that we may enter into such a union with Christ, God wants us not only to believe in Christ but to believe into Christ
Now as those who are one with Him and in Him, we need to do all that God requires by Christ and through Christ
No longer should we live by ourselves and do things by ourselves, but we should live by Christ and do everything by Christ
As we read this book today, we need to realize that it concerns not only the people of Israel but also concerns us
In Deuteronomy expressions such as law, commandments, statutes, ordinances, and judgments are synonyms of Christ
Out of God's mouth have proceeded the law, the commandments, the statutes, the ordinances, and the judgments, and all of these are Christ
In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, the Word was incarnated, and this incarnated Word is Jesus Christ
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
With the Father we have love; with the Son, love and grace; and with the Holy Spirit, love, grace, and fellowship
As far as we are concerned, this is impossible, but it is possible through the Triune God embodied in the Son, who is realized as the Spirit
Rather, we should hate and reject our effort to serve God and match Him, for it is actually abominable in the sight of God
The Gospel of John reveals that when the Father sent the Son, the Son did not come by Himself but came with the Father
The love of God is in the grace of Christ, and the grace of Christ with the love of God is transmitted in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Although the book of Deuteronomy often uses the expression 'Jehovah your God,' it does not explicitly mention Christ or the Spirit
The law, the commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments are all the word, and the word is Christ
In Romans 10 Paul interprets the word in Deuteronomy as Christ, referring in verse 8 to 'the word of the faith'
We may think that the word in Deuteronomy is the word of the law, but Paul regards it as the word of the faith
The commandments, the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments are the word, and the word is the word of faith
Since all these are synonyms of Christ, as we are reading Deuteronomy we may want to replace them with the word Christ
Paul's interpretation in Romans 10 implies the Spirit; it implies that the Christ whom he is describing is the Spirit
In his interpretation of Deuteronomy 301114 Paul presents a wonderful description of Christ as the incarnated crucified and resurrected One
Christ is the One who came down from the heavens in incarnation thus there is no need for anyone to ascend to the heavens to bring Him down
As we continue to call upon the name of the Lord, He becomes our life supply, our strength, and our everything
If we have the understanding concerning the Christ found in Romans 10, we will come to the book of Deuteronomy in a new way
That wandering had been used by God to produce a new generation, and this generation needed the training of the law
The three matters of not making idols, not bowing down to idols, and not serving idols are all part of the second commandment
You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold guiltless him who takes the name of Jehovah in vain'
Having our days extended is a matter of longevity, and having things go well with us is a matter of being blessed
It is very significant that the commandment to honor our parents is included with the commandments related to God
Whereas the children of Israel were charged to keep the commandments, statutes, and judgments, we today need to keep Christ
In this message we will consider, as a part of the general advices and warnings, the rehearsal of the law in 7:1 8:20
They were not to make a covenant with these nations, show them any favor, or make marriage alliances with them
According to the divine thought, these nations had to be exterminated because they were devilish and mingled with demons
The Hebrew word translated 'personal treasure' has a double meaning; it means both personal possession and peculiar treasure
In verse 16 Moses said, 'You shall devour all the peoples which Jehovah your God is giving to you; your eye shall not pity them'
For this reason, the Canaanites, who were useful in keeping the beasts from multiplying, were to be cleared away little by little
All these are the words that have proceeded out of God's mouth as God's breathing, and they all refer to Christ
In Deuteronomy 8:4 and 5 Moses went on to say, 'Your clothing did not wear out from upon you, nor did your foot swell these forty years
Concerning this water, first there were the fountains, which were the source, and then the springs and the brooks, the outflow
In verse 10 Moses said, 'You shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless Jehovah your God for the good land which He has given to you'
The people were to remember Jehovah their God, for it was He who gave them strength to gain wealth, so that He might establish His covenant
Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is about to dispossess them from before you'
God's dispossessing the nations was not due to the uprightness of the heart of His people; it was due to the wickedness of the nations
Suppose some among the new generation of the children of Israel said, 'This rebellion was not our fault it was the mistake of our fathers
To any who might have spoken in this way, Moses might have replied, 'Do not say that you are different from your fathers
In order to give them an illustration of their history of rebellion, Moses reminded them of what they did at the mount of God
The young people should recognize that, according to God's ordination, there is authority in the family, in society, and in the church
God 'does not regard persons and does not take bribes' , and we should take this as a way, not regarding persons and not receiving bribes
To take Christ as our way is to live Him, and to live Him is to express Him, to manifest Him, and even to magnify Him
In the New Jerusalem there is just one street, which is of pure gold , signifying that the nature of God is our way
The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and flows in the midst of the street
To visit people in order to get them saved and baptized and then to care for them afterward requires all our heart, soul, and strength
Today we need to keep Christ and the riches of Christ which have been ministered to us so that we may be blessed
Moses continued his charge by saying, 'Circumcise then the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stiff-necked any longer'
In verse 20 Moses says You shall fear Jehovah your God Him shall you serve and to Him shall you hold fast and by His name shall you swear
In 11825 we see that if the children of Israel were willing to keep Moses words of advice and warning they would receive certain blessings
If we today keep Christ and hold fast to Christ, we will be strengthened and encouraged to go on to possess Christ
The more we contact the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we are strengthened and encouraged to press on to gain Him
For us today, the promised land is Christ, and our days may be extended not upon Christ but in Christ and with Christ
The third blessing is the blessing of rain, the blessing of the heavenly watering of everything in their realm
We should also wear Christ as a frontlet between our eyes and teach Christ to others, speaking of Christ wherever we may be
Catholicism has brought in many of the things practiced by the nations, many things related to the worship of idols
We should gather together in the name of the Lord and worship God with Christ as the reality of all the offerings and sacrifices
In order to preserve the oneness of the children of Israel, God did not allow each of the twelve tribes to have its own worship center
Regardless of their number, God's children, the believers in Christ, must be one and have the same center for the worship of God
Both in Deuteronomy 12 and in the New Testament Gods way to keep the oneness of His people is to have a place with His name the unique name
Christians are accustomed to being gathered into other names, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Methodist
According to the type in Deuteronomy 12, it is a serious matter to be gathered into a name other than the unique name of the Lord
Not designating ourselves by any title or name, we should simply be gathered together into the name of the Lord
Both Deuteronomy 12 and the New Testament reveal that the place chosen by God for our worship of Him is the place of His habitation
In gathering together for the worship of God by enjoying Christ, we must gather into the name of Christ and we must be in the spirit
At the entrance of the church is the cross, and everyone who would come into the church must experience the cross and be crucified
We should not bring anything of the old man, anything of the flesh, the self, or the natural life, into the church
We should not have any preferences but take God's choice, which is the unique ground, the proper place for the worship of God
If there had not been such a definite ground for the worship of God, the children of Israel would have been divided
Surely each tribe would have chosen a place within its own territory, and spontaneously there would have been twelve divisions
The children of Israel had to come to the place which God had chosen even though for many of the tribes the journey was long and difficult
As they were making the ascent, they sang, 'Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity'!
In the type in Deuteronomy 12, the children of Israel were required to come to a particular geographical location
In John 4 the Lord Jesus responded to the question of the Samaritan woman concerning the proper place for the worship of God
He said to her, 'An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father
We remain in the oneness and are not divided, for wherever we may be, we meet in the Lord's name, in the spirit, and with the cross
Recently, in the prayer meeting of the church in Anaheim, there were saints present from a number of different countries
Even though they may live in the same city, they will not meet together because they want to have their own preference
We all meet in the name of Jesus Christ, and we all meet in the mingled spirit in the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit
At the entrance of the church there is the cross, and in order to meet as the church we must experience the cross
In chapter thirteen, which we will consider in this message, we have an even more definite word a word concerning apostasy
In the New Testament, apostasy denotes the denial of Christ's deity; it refers to not believing that Christ is God incarnated to be a man
The existence of God is a mystery, and the incarnation of God to become a man named Jesus is an even greater mystery
For this reason it is more difficult for people to believe that God became a man than it is for them to believe that there is a God
They believe that the Lord Jesus was merely a man, that He was a teacher, and that He died as a martyr, not to accomplish redemption
The New Testament deals very strictly with division and with the denial of the teaching that Christ is God incarnated to become a man
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
The teaching which the Apostle John refers to here is the teaching that God came through incarnation to be a man
In his gospel this same John says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
Someone may not be correct in his teaching about a certain doctrine, but this does not mean that he is apostate
The book of Romans presents a complete picture of God's salvation, a picture that comprises both the Christian and the church life
For a believer to be weak in faith does not mean that he has no faith; it means that, although he has faith, he is weak in faith
Of judging the believers with respect to such matters, we should receive them in love, for God has received them
Paul says, 'We who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak, and not to please ourselves'
We must receive all kinds of genuine believers whether they eat herbs or eat meat whether they keep certain days or consider every day alike
In Romans 14 and 15 Paul is generous, broad-minded, and all-embracing, but in Romans 16:17 he is very narrow and strict
They were not to yield to such a one nor listen to him, nor was their eye to pity him, nor were they to spare him nor conceal him
Rather, Moses said, 'You must slay him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people
Concerning such a case, the children of Israel were to investigate and examine carefully and inquire thoroughly
In Deuteronomy 12 Moses was strict in the matter of division, and in Deuteronomy 13 he was strict in the matter of apostasy
We must keep the unique oneness of God's people and the unique faith in the person and redemptive work of Christ
The children of Israel were not allowed to tolerate apostasy even in someone as close as a brother, son, daughter, or wife
Romans 14 and 15 indicate that in the matter of receiving the believers Paul is generous, broad-minded, and all-embracing
Of sympathizing with those who make divisions and causes of falling, we are charged by Paul to turn away from them
The reason we must turn away from those who cause divisions is that division is extremely serious it destroys the Body of Christ
Apostasy, or heresy, insults God Himself and damages the person of Christ, and division damages God's people as His corporate expression
The person contacting you may be innocent, but, even though he is not knowledgeable, he may nevertheless be carrying the 'germs' of division
If the one contacting you is spreading the germs of death, the more you talk with him, the more you will be deadened
As long as your contact with this person causes you to be deadened, this is an indication that this one is spreading the germs of death
If you continue to listen to the speaking of such a divisive one, you may find that questions are rising up within you
After talking with a divisive one, you may be filled with questions questions about the church and about the Lord's recovery
As we will see in the next message, in Deuteronomy 14 Moses turns from the matters of division and apostasy to the matter of the holy diet
As God's holy people, we need to take care concerning not only division and apostasy but also concerning the kind of people we contact
As we contact people, we need to be careful, for in our contact with others we may receive what they are, what they have, and what they know
Not boiling a kid in its mother's milk typifies that the milk of the word of God should not be used to kill new believers in Christ
We should use the milk of the word, Christ as the life supply, to nourish newborn Christians, not to kill them
The word of Christ which produces milk should be used always to nourish the babes in Christ, never to kill them
On the one hand, we should not eat without discernment; on the other hand, we should not allow a kid to be boiled in its mother's milk
If we contact such ones without discernment, we will be infected, perhaps unconsciously, for these germs are very contagious
Once a saint has been infected in this way, he will become cold toward the recovery and toward the church life
Also, we need to protect our young ones from those who would use the milk of the word to boil them, to kill them
At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your produce for that year and lay it within your gates'
The Levites, who had no job or other source of income but who lived on God, serving Him full-time, were to be taken care of in this way
Even if the one who gave the tithe was in sorrow or had suffering, he did not eat for his happiness what was reserved for the needy
In Deuteronomy 13 we see that God takes care of Himself, and in Deuteronomy 12, that He takes care of His people as His expression
Now in the verses concerning aid to the needy we see that God takes care of all those who are part of His expression
We should love the Lord Jesus, we should love His Body, and we should take care of the needs of all the members
There was a limitation to the heavenly communism: the children of Israel were to release their brothers only, not the foreigners
If Gods people released that which they had lent to their brothers they would bring in Gods blessing that there would be no poor among them
You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you'
God's people were not only to practice the release every seven years; they were also required to lend to the poor brothers
Suppose a poor brother had once asked an Israelite for a loan, and this brother was released from his debt in the year of release
The people were required to open their hand to the poor one and to lend enough for his need in whatever he lacked
In verse 9 the children of Israel were warned about not having a base thought in their heart with respect to lending to the poor brothers
In this message on the rehearsing of the general statutes and judgments, we will consider some further matters concerning aid to the needy
If your brother, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years; but in the seventh year you shall set him free'
We love Him, we love His family, and, not wanting to leave Him, we tell Him that we want to remain in His service forever
Whenever we make such a free-will offering to the Lord Jesus, He will never reject it but will always accept it
For a Hebrew servant to be his master's servant forever meant that he gave up his liberty and no longer had any freedom
Moses, an old man who surely knew human nature, charged the masters not to view the release of a servant as a hardship
He shall dwell with you, even in your midst, in the place which he chooses among your towns, wherever he pleases; you shall not oppress him'
It seems that, according to God's arrangement, a slave had a right to escape and then to dwell in the place of his choice
An Israelite was not to make a brother pay interest on money, on food, or on anything on which one pays interest
Even if a borrower had nothing other than a handmill or upper millstone to give as a pledge, the lender was not to take such a pledge
When the children of Israel lent anything to their neighbor, they were not to enter his house in order to take his pledge
The children of Israel were not to oppress a poor and needy hired servant among their brothers or among the sojourners with them
On the day that the hired servant earned his wages, the children of Israel were to give him his wages before the sun went down
In 24:17-22 we see that the children of Israel were to remember the need of a sojourner, an orphan, or a widow
The children of Israel were not to distort justice due a sojourner or an orphan, nor were they to take a widow's garment as a pledge
When the children of Israel reaped their harvest in their field and they forgot a sheaf in the field they were not to turn back to gather it
When the children of Israel beat down the fruit of their olive tree, they were not to go over the boughs afterwards
For the people not to glean after cutting the grapes from their vineyard was for them to remember that they were slaves in Egypt
At the end of the year, he might be surprised to see that, because of God's blessing, his profit greatly exceeded his expectations
In all that we do in the matters of lending and harvesting, we should remember God's need with respect to the needy ones
If we remember this need, then secretly God will remember us and bless us in all our undertakings, in all our business
As we are doing our business, we should remember the needy ones among God's children and have a heart toward them
In this message we will consider those general statutes and judgments which are concerned with the worship of God
In their worship of God, the children of Israel were required to give tithes of all the produce of both their cattle and their crop
Rather, they were to bring the tithes to the place where Jehovah would choose to set His name and to have His habitation
The children of Israel offered the tithes to God and then they enjoyed before God and with God what they had offered to God
Whenever we come together in the Lord's name, in the spirit, and with the cross , we meet with God through Christ
The children of Israel were to eat the tithes before God in the place of His choice so that they might learn to fear God always
In 15:19-23 we see that the children of Israel were to worship God also by offering the firstborn males of the herd and of the flock
You and your household shall eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place which Jehovah will choose'
Any animal having a blemish, lameness, or blindness was not to be sacrificed to Jehovah God , for that was an abomination to Him
These festivals respectively signify the feasts of the redemption of Christ, the producing of the church, and the coming kingdom
You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Jehovah your God, which you will make for yourself'
In this way, the children of Israel would utterly remove this abomination, the evil, from the midst of the people
Those who made a vow voluntarily, promising God to do a certain thing, were required to keep and do what proceeded out of their lips
Like the tithes, a portion of the first of all fruit was to be brought to the place which Jehovah would choose
Now that God had fulfilled His promise concerning the good land, they were to bring some of the fruit of the land for God's enjoyment
You and the Levite and the sojourner in your midst shall rejoice in all the good which Jehovah your God has given to you and your household'
For us to worship God in our spirit means that we worship Him in the mingled spirit, in our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit
If we would worship God properly we need to honor His name meet in the place of His habitation and worship in the place where the altar is
Since the Lord's dwelling place is in our regenerated spirit , we also need to exercise our spirit, which is mingled with the divine Spirit
The portions of Deuteronomy which deal with the divine government are the word of God, not merely the word of Moses
The first requirement in the judgment of a complicated civil suit was to bring the case to the place which Jehovah God would choose
As 33:8 indicates, the Levitical priests had the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, which provided instant enlightenment
The king was to write out for himself a copy of the law in a book, out of that which was before the Levitical priests
A proper king among the children of Israel was one who was instructed, governed, ruled, and controlled by the word of God
If the elders do not read the Bible and are not controlled by the word of God, they cannot administrate the church
Spontaneously God will be in their decisions, and the elders will represent God to manage the affairs of the church
The result of the kings not doing these things would be that he and his sons would extend their days in their kingdom in the midst of Israel
In 21:1-9 we have the judgment of one who murdered a man, the slain one being found in the field in the good land
The priests, the sons of Levi, were to draw near, and by their word every dispute and every assault was to be settled
Cover Your people Israel, whom You have ransomed, O Jehovah, and do not set the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of Your people Israel'
After the elders had washed their hands and spoken these words, the guilt of the blood would be covered from them
Whereas Stephen was killed by being stoned , the Lord Jesus was killed by being crucified, that is, by being hanged on a tree
Peter used the word tree when speaking of the Lord's crucifixion: 'Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree'
The expression his neighbor's wife in verse 24 indicates that, in the sight of God, engagement is equal to marriage
Mary had been betrothed, engaged, to Joseph, but because she was with child, he was considering to 'put her away'
In the case of a man lying with an unengaged virgin , the man was to give fifty shekels of silver to the virgin's father
God's people must fear Him in doing all things, for He wants to see that His people are pure and decent in every way
Through the execution of the kidnapper, the evil was to be utterly removed from the midst of the children of Israel
In recent years, certain ones have attempted to 'kidnap' some of the brothers and to 'enslave' them and then to 'sell' them
These ones have not tried to kidnap the outsiders; they have tried to kidnap the brothers, the members of the Body of Christ
Fathers were not to be put to death because of their children, nor were the children to be put to death because of their fathers
All the points concerning the divine government among the children of Israel show us that God is a God of justice
In 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 Paul tells us that a dispute among brothers in the church should be settled by certain able ones in the church
If we degrade a brother by criticizing him or by speaking excessively of his wrongdoing, the divine life within us will condemn us
Deuteronomy 25:5-10 speaks regarding the judgment over a brother who was not willing to do the duty of a husband's brother
The firstborn whom the wife bore was to assume the name of her deceased husband, so that his name would not be blotted out of Israel
Because he had no successor, his name would be blotted out from among the children of Israel, and his entire house would cease
Since his brother would not do his duty, the brother's name was to be called, 'The house of him whose sandal has been removed'
In the church life today, we may have differing scales one scale for measuring others and a different scale for measuring ourselves
Certain saints may use one scale to weigh the actions of the elders and the co-workers but a different scale in weighing their own actions
Because these saints have differing scales, no matter where they may go, they do not find the church and the elders to be satisfactory
May we all receive mercy from the Lord to no longer have differing scales but, like our God, to have the same scale for everyone
The tithes went to the Levites, who then selected the best of the tithes to be offered to God as a particular tithe
In 18:15-19 Moses spoke concerning Jehovah God's raising up of a Prophet like Moses for the children of Israel
Acts 3:22 applies these verses to Christ, indicating that Christ is the Prophet promised by God to His people, the children of Israel
The Prophet raised up by God would be according to all that the children of Israel asked of Jehovah their God at Horeb
When a prophet spoke in the name of Jehovah and the thing did not happen, that was the thing which Jehovah had not spoken
The children of Israel were to set apart cities of refuge , cities into which those who had killed others accidentally could escape
The number two, implied by the fact that there were cities on the two sides of the Jordan, signifies testimony or witness
The moving of such a boundary marker was not allowed by the faithful God, who gave the children of Israel the good land to possess
The first pair is the supply of the Levitical priests and the whole tribe of Levi and the prohibitions against certain evil practices
They were to bring a portion of the produce to the serving ones, and the serving ones were to offer a portion of what they received to God
God has a large family, and the entire family, including God, the One who has given the good land, is involved with the good land
Fallen human beings, having lost God, turn to these evil things for the sake of security, longevity, peace, and well-being
The Triune God embodied in Christ as the Spirit is not only our portion and our enjoyment but also our Prophet
For the third pair, we have the word concerning the cities of refuge and the word concerning the moving of the neighbor's boundary marker
On the one hand, we have a word indicating that Christ is our city of refuge, that He is the place into which we can escape
According to verse 8, the officers were to speak further to the people, saying, 'Is there any man who is afraid and whose heart fails?
The women, the little ones, the cattle, and all that was in the city they were to take as their plunder for their enjoyment
When the children of Israel besieged a city for many days to capture it, they were not to destroy its trees which were good for food
They were to destroy and cut down the trees which were not for food, that they might build up a siegework against the city until it fell
When an Israelite saw a beautiful woman among the captives and would take her to himself as a wife, he was to bring her within his house
Apparently, the matters of fighting in 20:1-20 and the birthright in 21:15-17 have nothing to do with each other
Spiritually speaking, fighting and the birthright are related, for only by fighting can we preserve our birthright
Since we preserve our birthright by fighting, if we do not fight, we will lose our birthright, even as Esau lost his birthright
Of living by the divine life, we may turn to the old life and ask the Lord Jesus to help us to improve ourselves
An Israelite was not to see his brother's ox or sheep straying and neglect them; he was to return them to his brother
The word brother in 22:1 indicates that, in the sight of God, all the children of Israel were members of one family
An Israelite was not to see his brother's donkey or ox fallen by the way and neglect them; he had to lift them up with the brother
The appearance of the brothers and sisters should be such that there is a clear distinction between male and female
If an Israelite sowed two kinds of seed in his vineyard, neither the produce of that seed nor the increase of the vineyard would be his
He had to let the mother go, but the young he could take for himself, that it might go well with him and that he might extend his days
If an Israelite wanted a blessed, healthy, and long life, he had to fulfill the requirement concerning the sparing of a producing animal
In relation to the brothers and sisters today, we should keep the statute concerning sparing the producing animals
He who had been wounded in the testicles or had the male organ cut off was not to enter the congregation of Jehovah
They were prohibited from entering the congregation of Jehovah also because they hired Balaam to curse the children of Israel
The children of Israel were not to seek the peace and the prosperity of the Ammonites and the Moabites all their days forever
The children of the third generation of the Edomites and the Egyptians could enter the congregation of Jehovah
We should love the producing things and be careful not to lose the right to enter the congregation of the Lord
There was not to be a cult prostitute among the daughters of Israel, nor was there to be a cult prostitute among the sons of Israel
When the children of Israel entered their neighbor's vineyard, they could eat grapes, but they were not to put any into their vessel
God is happy to see the young people coming together in marriage, and He is even more happy to see them reproduce
God also wants us to be reproductive in the church life through the preaching of the gospel that sinners might be saved and regenerated
Concerning a case of leprosy, the people were to carefully keep what the Levitical priests instructed them, as God commanded the priests
The children of Israel were to remember what Jehovah their God did to Miriam on the way when they came out of Egypt
Moses used thirteen chapters, from chapter fourteen through chapter twenty-six, to cover the rehearsal of the law with certain developments
These five principles govern our behavior in five directions toward God toward ourselves toward others toward animals and toward the devil
Whereas we should be strict with ourselves, toward others we should be kind and generous, always willing to give
The God manifested in this book is not only loving, merciful, and gracious; He is also very fine, tender, considerate, and sympathetic
In 27:1-26 Moses, with the elders of Israel, commanded the people to keep the whole commandment which he was commanding them that day
When the children of Israel crossed over the Jordan into the God-given land, they were to erect large stones on Mount Ebal
The stones were to be coated with plaster , and upon them the people were to write very clearly 'all the words of this law'
In the God-given land, the children of Israel were to build to Jehovah their God an altar of stones not touched by an iron tool
It is significant that when the blessings and the curses were about to be released, Moses charged the people to build an altar
The building of an altar is a great matter, for, after man's fall, what we first need with respect to God is an altar the cross of Christ
We thank God that, before He dealt with us regarding blessing or cursing, He accomplished salvation through Christ's redemption on the cross
Upon the altar, which signifies the cross of Christ, the children of Israel were to offer up burnt offerings to God
If we intend to do something before God, we must first offer Christ to God as a burnt offering for God's satisfaction
Moses also commanded that the other six tribes Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali should stand upon Mount Ebal for cursing
The Levites were to respond and, speaking to the people with a loud voice, were to utter the curses recorded in verses 15 through 26
Before we believed into Christ and were saved, we were cursed under God's commandments, statutes, and judgments
God has provided an altar, the cross of Christ, and at the cross we take Christ as the burnt offering offered to God for His satisfaction
We also take Christ as our burnt offering and peace offering for God's satisfaction and our enjoyment with God
The peace offering is food for both God and us, and we enjoy this food in the presence of God as we have fellowship with Him
As those who are under the cross we can satisfy God and also find satisfaction for ourselves through Christ our Redeemer and our Substitute
The children of Israel would be blessed also in their storehouses, in all their undertakings, and in the God-given land
Moses was very concerned that they might turn aside to other gods, to idols, and, in Deuteronomy, he repeatedly warned them not to do this
The diseases here would not come and go but would cling to the people until they were consumed from off the land
Finally, they would be cursed in being scattered among all the peoples, in living a life in captivity, full of terrors
They would be brought back to Egypt, and there they would offer themselves for sale to their enemies, but no one would buy them
Because of God's protection, the Arab nations surrounding Israel have not been able to destroy this tiny nation
As God's requirements, the Ten Commandments are an expression of God Himself; they are a portrait of what God is
On the one hand Christ is the One who makes the requirements on the other hand Christ is the One who meets and satisfies these requirements
We cannot meet His requirements, but He Himself has come to be our Substitute to replace us and to fulfill what He requires of us
As we read Deuteronomy 27 and consider the monument, the altar, and the offerings, we can see this wonderful scene
In this scene we see Christ as the embodiment of God standing before us with His demands and requirements according to what He is
Because we cannot fulfill His requirements, He came to be our Redeemer, to be the One cursed for us on the cross
When this One was crucified, He was consumed by fire as the sacrifice to satisfy God and to fulfill His requirements
In this scene we have the monument and the altar, that is, the requiring One and the fulfilling and satisfying One
Now we can see the monument, but we can also see the altar with the offerings burned upon it to fulfill what is written on the monument
In this wonderful scene we see the requiring God and also the Redeemer, who is nothing less than the requiring God Himself
It is also through the monument, the altar, and the offerings that we receive all the blessings which God would give us in Christ
If we have this vision, we will surely say, 'Hallelujah for God, for the cross of Christ, and for Christ, our Redeemer and Substitute'!
Because the children of Israel were rebellious in the wilderness, they did not understand what God was doing with them
The enactment of the covenant was also based upon all that the children of Israel had experienced in the wilderness for forty years
Their clothing did not wear out, and they did not eat bread nor drink wine or strong drink, that they might know that Jehovah was their God
The purpose of the enactment of the covenant was also for God to establish the children of Israel as His people and Himself as their God
The expression to the ruin of the moist with the dry is a Hebrew idiom indicating destruction of everything in his path
For the children of Israel in Deuteronomy 29, the things revealed were the law, the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments
The commandment which Moses was commanding the children of Israel was not too difficult for them, nor was it distant
It was not in heaven that they should say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it'?
Nor was it across the sea that they should say, 'Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it'?
As we have pointed out in Romans 10610 Paul relates the word spoken here to Christ for the New Testament believers to receive for salvation
Moses called heaven and earth to witness against them: he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse
In verses 4 and 5 Moses said that Jehovah would do to the nations even as He did to Sihon and Og and to their land
In verses 9-13 and 24-29 we have Moses' exhortation to the priests, the sons of Levi, and to the elders of Israel
He knew that after his death the children of Israel would utterly spoil themselves and turn away from the way that he had commanded them
Eventually, what Moses felt regarding the children of Israel became the fact, for, not too long afterward, they rebelled once again
He knew that the children of Israel were rebellious in nature, that the element of rebellion was part of their very being
Now we can understand that Moses, shortly before he was to die, was not at peace regarding the children of Israel
He seemed to be telling them, 'Do not forget what you are, and do not forget what Jehovah your God wants of you
In the seventh year, while you are enjoying the Feast of Tabernacles, you must listen to the words of this law'
Today we all need to realize that we are the same in nature as the children of Israel and should not have any trust in ourselves
We should not have any kind of assurance that, in ourselves, we are able to stand and remain in the church life
They would be devoured, and many evils and troubles would befall them because of all the evil they had done, for they turned to other gods
If we exercise our spirit as well as our mind, we will sense that Moses' words are like dropping rain and distilling dew
Moses vindicated the very God whom he served, declaring that He is the Rock and that His ways are not only just but justice itself
All the children of Israel were supposed to be God's sons, but in their living they did not behave like God's sons
Jehovah was provoked to anger by Israel, His sons and daughters, and said that He would hide His face from them
If they had been wise, they would have comprehended that it was Jehovah their Rock who sold them and delivered them up to their enemies
He would avenge the blood of His servants, repay His adversaries with vengeance, and cover the guilt of His land and of His people
Moses said to them that they should set their heart on all these words and command their children to do all the words of this law
Everything which Moses spoke in the book of Deuteronomy was an expression of his concern for the children of Israel
Even today, many of them have turned away from God to the idols of money, high technology, weapons, and skill in fighting
In this concluding message we will consider the blessing of Moses and also the death of Moses, and his successor
Whereas a young man may not have the heart to bless others, a mature man always gives people a blessing at the end of his conversation
Verse 1 says that this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death
Reuben, as the first son of Jacob, should have received the birthright, but he did something sinful and lost the birthright
Moses said that Jehovah's Thummim and Urim would be with His godly men, whom He tested at the waters of Meribah
Levi had said of his father and mother I do not regard him and his brothers he did not acknowledge and his children he did not recognize
The expression 'Him who dwelt in the bush' refers to God, who in Exodus 3 appeared to Moses from within a burning bush
Moses asked that all these blessings would come upon the head of Joseph and upon the top of him who is separate among his brothers
Most of the apostles, who were sent forth to disciple the nations, were produced from Zebulun, which was in the region of Galilee
In blessing Naphtali , Moses spoke of this tribe as being satisfied with favor and full of the blessing of Jehovah
According to Matthew 41316 the Lord Jesus fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 912 came to the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali beside the sea
If you study church history, you will see that much was gained for the Lord in the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea
Moses said that there is no one like the God of Jeshurun , who rides through the heavens as their help and in His majesty through the skies
We believe that Moses and Elijah, both of whom appeared when the Lord Jesus was transfigured , will be the two witnesses in Revelation 11
The culture and humanity of the West have been kept, preserved, and maintained largely due to the law of Moses
As we conclude our life-study of Deuteronomy, we would like to point out the four particular matters implied in this book
The first matter implied in Deuteronomy is Gods governmental dealing which is wise loving sympathetic patient purposeful and successful
The next matter implied in Deuteronomy is Moses' character, which was experienced, matured, loving, caring, faithful, and meek
What is primary is that by inhaling the divine breath in this book, we will enjoy Christ, the embodiment of the divine breath
