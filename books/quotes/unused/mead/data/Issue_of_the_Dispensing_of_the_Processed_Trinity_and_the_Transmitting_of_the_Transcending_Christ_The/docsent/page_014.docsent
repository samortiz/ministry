   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A number of people oppose this scriptural revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They think that the three of the Godhead are separate and that we cannot say the Son became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They just care for their theology.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They do not care for the spiritual, divine fact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord in whom we believe, Jesus Christ, who is the last Adam, has become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said that Christ lives in us Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, how could He live in us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ lives in us, works in us, and even makes His home in our heart Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If He were not the Spirit, how could He be with us in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the most He could only be among us, not within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I came to this country, a number of saints told me that they never knew that they had a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians today do not believe that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, nor do they believe that they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not have these two key points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without these two key points, there is no way to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible tells us that God created a spirit within man Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27; Job 32:8; Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible also tells us how God became a man and died to accomplish redemption to end the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His rising up He became another person the life-giving Spirit to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the morning He rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the evening He came back to the disciples to breathe upon them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By that time He was the life-giving Spirit to be received by His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From this point onward, the key points of the Christian life are the life-giving Spirit and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He not only rose up but also transcended to the heavens and passed through the heavens Heb 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ascended Christ has at least twelve statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Each status qualifies Him to minister in a certain realm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His ascension He was enthroned as Lord of all and appointed, assigned, to be the Christ of God Acts 2:36 .</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the Savior Acts 5:31b .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though we may want to save people, we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But He can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because He is the omnipotent One, He can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the High Priest Heb 4:15; 7:26 and the Advocate 1 John 2:1b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the Intercessor, interceding for us Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is also the Mediator of the new covenant 8:6 and the surety of the new testament 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Life-giver John 10:10b , the Comforter 14:16-17 , and the Lamb-God Rev 22:1b .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is in the heavens ministering all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The key point is that today He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without being the life-giving Spirit, He could never be the High Priest ministering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He could never be the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He could never be the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the life-giving Spirit to execute His covenant, to carry out what He has accomplished through His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 1 says that in Him we have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He redeemed us back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were fallen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That was our location.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Christ's redemption redeemed us out of that location and brought us into Himself as the realm and the element.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually this realm and this element are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the life-giving Spirit, and He has redeemed us out of Adam into Himself as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the redeemed ones of Christ, we all should declare, "I am in the Spirit!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not on the earth, nor are we merely in the heavens; we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit is our location.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit is our realm.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit is our element.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this realm and with this element, Christ is working every day to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit, who is the realm and the element, is the sanctifying and transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is transforming us metabolically, making us a particular treasure to become God's private possession, even God's heritage, God's inheritance Eph 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God wants to inherit something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He wants to inherit those who were once sinners and who have become a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we are in the cocoon, but eventually we will become a butterfly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are expecting to be glorified, and God is also expecting to see that we are glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then He will have a complete treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This may seem like a dream, but one day this dream will be fulfilled.</S>
