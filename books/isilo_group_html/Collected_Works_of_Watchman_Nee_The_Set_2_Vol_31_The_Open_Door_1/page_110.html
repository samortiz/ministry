From there he will go to England. Brother Chao Shih-guang and Brother John Wang are both leading the meetings in Hong Kong. Praise the Lord! I have received much help from them (March 15).</p><p>Mrs. Sun Zhu Ming-seng returned to Canton last Tuesday. Sister Chen Bi-kun accompanied her. Sister Chen returned to Hong Kong yesterday. She will go to work in Yunnan at the end of the month. My health is improving, but I have not finished my studies for this semester. Please pray for me (March 20).</p><p>(The preceding portions are excerpts from Brother Philip Luan's letters.)</p><p>Brother Wang Lien-jun is in Hong Kong now. Mr. Chao Tze-wei was sick. Senior Mrs. Nee went to pray for him, and his sickness was cured. He was also saved. Miss Hu and Miss Dai and two other overseas missionaries are living with Mrs. Lin An-teh at 12 Granville Road, Floor 3, Kowloon. They really care about the work in Chung-Shan and pray for me often. Mrs. Lin An-teh greets Miss Chang. (This is an excerpt from Sister Huang Ro-chen's letter of March 7.)</p><p>I came from Chung-Shan to Hong Kong on the twenty-sixth of last month. Sister Huang came one day before me. I received much help in Hong Kong through listening to Mr. Nee's preaching. Sister Huang and I are staying in Mrs. Nee's house. We have received much care and help from the brothers and sisters. This is the Lord's grace. Thank and praise Him! We can probably return to Chung-Shan the day after tomorrow. We will stay in Chung-Shan for a few days before taking a trip to Canton. (This is an excerpt from Sister Kuo Hai-jen's March 7 letter.)</p><p>My lungs have had the proper pressure since I received the shots from the air needles. However, a special condition arose in my right lung, and it became hard, so the doctors stopped the shots. I have a bronchial infection, and my coughing continues, which hurts my lungs. The doctors operated on my lungs (they wanted to remove the nerves). My nerves were removed on December 8. That night I could not stop spitting up blood. Fortunately, I was not in any danger, thank the Lord. I have been very well since entering the hospital. The only difficulty is that I do not speak the language, so many things are inconvenient. I have really lost all hope in medicine. I only hope in my Lord. I confess that God's will is never wrong. The ability to run around is the Lord's grace. Being able to lie down is also the Lord's grace. We are all living in His grace. May the Lord increase my heart of submission. Please pray more for me that I would not just be wasting time lying down but could obtain that which the Lord wants me to obtain and learn what the Lord wants me to learn. I want to submit to His discipline and overcome all sufferings. (This is an excerpt from Sister Ma Min-jen's letter of March 28. Sister Ma's mailing address is [omitted].)</p><h2 class="head2">Manila</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>We are in my elder brother's home. We want to rent our own house, but my brother will not allow us. He not only obliged us to stay in his house but also says that it is God's arrangement and that I must obey. May the Father accomplish His will in this house. I have completely placed the future in the Lord's hands. My brother recently suggested that we have a home prayer meeting. I really thank the Lord. There is now a prayer meeting every Friday evening in my brother's home. We have had it twice already. Please remember this in your prayers. My brother believes in God and in His love. He believes that God hears prayer, but he has not yet seen the relationship of the blood to himself. He really needs the work of the Holy Spirit. It would be best for the assembly here if you and Sister Miao Yun-chun could come among the sisters. It would really be beneficial to the believers if Brother Witness Lee could make a trip here. We are praying for this. Sister Chai Teh-an will go to Singapore soon because the brothers and sisters there sent a telegram inviting her. She also felt that she should go. Thus, Manila is losing a worker and sister who really knows the work of the cross. I am really sad in my human emotion because I am losing a sister who is in one accord, but I can only say "amen" to God's will.</p><p>I have obtained one copy of the second issue of The Open Door; through it I have learned about the work in each place. The believers today are scattered in many places. I really feel that this type of publication is very precious. May the Father give His children the burden and strength to pray. Since the power of darkness is so fierce and the believers are tempted on all sides in their pilgrimage through this world, we really feel that praying for one another is so important. Peace in the Lord. En-hung and my two daughters send their greetings. Greet Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and Mrs. Yuan in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Lin Hsue Yun-chang<br />February 4<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_109.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_111.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 110</div><br></body></html>
