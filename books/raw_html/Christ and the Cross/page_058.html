<h1 class="title">BEARING THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 10:37-39; 16:23-25; Mark 8:34-35; Luke 9:23-24; 14:26-27; 2 Cor. 4:10; Rom. 8:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BEARING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Many Christians have the inaccurate concept that bearing the cross means to suffer or endure hardships. According to the revelation of the Bible, the emphasis on bearing the cross is not related to suffering or enduring hardships but to accepting death, that is, being put to death. The purpose of the cross is not suffering but death. The cross puts a person in the place of death, not in a place of suffering. The cross is not a suffering penalty; it is a death penalty. To hang on the cross is surely a suffering; nevertheless, the purpose of hanging on the cross is not suffering but death. Therefore, bearing the cross is not about accepting and enduring suffering but about accepting death. To bear the cross is to enter into death, to be dealt with by death, so that we stop our function and activity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CRUCIFIED AND BEARING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the first person to bear the cross. On the way to being crucified at Golgotha the Lord bore a physical, visible cross (John 19:17), but He also bore an intangible, invisible cross during His entire life on earth. He put Himself under the death of the cross so that He could obey God&rsquo;s will, speak what God wanted Him to speak, and do what God wanted Him to do. The Lord&rsquo;s entire life on the earth was a living under the death of the cross. He did not seek His own will or do anything by Himself. He sought God&rsquo;s will, and He spoke and did things according to God (5:19, 30).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He never left the position of death; He never abandoned the cross. He remained under the death of the cross, lived a life of the cross, and walked the way of the cross until He was nailed to the cross at Golgotha. His acceptance of the cross did not begin at Golgotha, because He bore an invisible cross within Himself throughout His entire life. Ultimately, He bore a physical, visible cross outwardly and was crucified at the end of His life.</p>
<p>Crucifixion was the Lord Jesus&rsquo; obedience to the will of God (Matt. 26:39, 42, 44); thus, we have no part in it. During the first three hours of His crucifixion, from 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon, He suffered man&rsquo;s persecution for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will (Mark 15:25-33). During the last three hours of His crucifixion, from 12:00 noon to 3:00 P.M. (Matt. 27:45), He suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment in His bearing of our sins. The Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours. We have no part in His suffering of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on the cross. However, when He died on the cross, He was not alone, for we died with Him (Gal. 2:20). We were included in His death. When He was crucified, we were crucified with Him (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>We do not share in the aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion related to His persecution by man, nor do we share in the aspect of His crucifixion related to His being judged by God for our sins. Our experience of the crucifixion of Christ is limited to the termination of all things. The Lord Jesus was killed by men for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will, and He suffered God&rsquo;s punishment because He bore our sins. Only the Lord Jesus was qualified to accomplish God&rsquo;s will and to bear our sins. Hence, we have no part in His crucifixion to accomplish God&rsquo;s will or in His being judged by God for our sins. However, we are included in the termination of all things, which was accomplished through His crucifixion. The Lord brought us with Him to the cross, and He included us in His death. We did not bear the cross with Him, but we were crucified together with Him. We have no part in His experience of bearing the cross, but we fully participated in His crucifixion. Hence, we were crucified with Him when He was crucified.</p>
<p>Through our union with Christ by faith, we were crucified with Him. When a person is saved, he should believe and accept his co-crucifixion with Christ, and thereafter he should live under the death of this co-crucifixion by willingly and joyfully allowing this death to be applied to him by the Spirit. Then instead of living by himself, he will live by God to obey the will of God. This is the spiritual reality of bearing the cross.</p>
<p>Unlike the Lord, who was crucified after bearing the cross, our crucifixion occurred before we were called to bear the cross. The Lord put Himself under the death of the cross before He was crucified, but we can put ourselves under the death of the cross because we have been crucified with the Lord. The Lord bore the cross before He was crucified, but we need to be crucified before we can bear the cross. Our bearing the cross is based on our being crucified. By the Spirit we can put ourselves under the death of the cross because we have been crucified with Christ. Our being under the killing of the cross is based on our co-crucifixion with Christ. Even though our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross was accomplished by Christ, we need to put ourselves under the death of the cross by the Spirit. Our crucifixion is a fact already accomplished by Christ, but our bearing the cross is an experience that we continually carry out.</p>
<p>Our crucifixion is an accomplished fact that requires nothing from us other than seeing, believing, and accepting. Bearing the cross, however, is a personal experience. We are responsible for bearing the cross by the Spirit. We cannot and we need not crucify ourselves, but we can and we must bear the cross ourselves. We cannot crucify ourselves, but we can put ourselves under the death of the cross. Crucifixion was accomplished by the Lord on our behalf, and it requires no effort on our part. However, bearing the cross is our responsibility; it is something that we must carry out. Our bearing the cross is based on the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion. Without the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion for us, we could have no experience of bearing the cross. Crucifixion is the basis for bearing the cross, and bearing the cross is the issue of crucifixion. We see, believe, and accept the crucifixion, but we practice bearing the cross.</p>
<p>Seeing the crucifixion is a matter of faith, but bearing the cross is an act of faith. With our faith in the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, we should bear the cross based on and by this faith. We receive the fact of crucifixion by faith, and we experience the bearing of the cross by this same faith. Although we did not personally experience the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion but instead accepted it by faith, we experience the bearing of the cross and carry it out by an act of faith. Bearing the cross is a personal experience that we carry out; thus, the cross that we bear is our cross. When we apply the Lord&rsquo;s cross to ourselves, making it our personal experience, this cross becomes our cross.</p>
<p>There is only one cross that saves&mdash;the cross of the Lord. We do not need to be nailed to this cross; we need only to bear it. We need only to accept the work that the Lord accomplished in His crucifixion, apply it to ourselves, and bear it. Our co-crucifixion was accomplished by the Lord once and for all, and we need only to accept it once, but bearing the cross is constant and continual. Although we need only to accept the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion once, we must continually bear the cross. Crucifixion requires one acceptance, but bearing the cross requires continual application. The Lord wants us to bear the cross daily in order to follow Him (Luke 9:23). We must continually put ourselves under the death of the cross by willingly accepting death and gladly bearing the cross so that we may be delivered from ourselves, live by God, and obey the will of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
