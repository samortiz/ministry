   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 The Believers Enjoying Him as the Life Essence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through His Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The believers may enjoy Christ as the life essence through His death and resurrection; that is, they may enjoy Him as the life essence released through His death and dispensed through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord, as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death v. 25 that we may enjoy the eternal life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To lose our soul-life is to follow Him that we may serve Him and walk with Him on this way, the way of losing the soul-life and living in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is indicated by the Lord s word to the disciples in verse 26a, If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we need to pray, Lord, grant me the grace to be willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, I want to follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You said that wherever You are, there will Your servants be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, since You are in death, we must be in death also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One difference between Christ as the one grain and us as the many is that He was willing to fall into the ground, but we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of falling into the ground to die, we like to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if we are lifted up, there will be no multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only way for a grain to multiply is to fall into the ground and die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise, it will remain alone, perhaps in a high place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All genuine Christians are grains, but not many are willing to fall into the ground and die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There might be a huge crowd, but there might be very little life because few are willing to experience the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since nearly everyone is unwilling to die and prefers to receive glory, no life is imparted into others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is easy to have a crowd but difficult to impart life into others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To do this, we need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Lord s recovery we do not need a crowd; we need the death that releases life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to experience this aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s death not only releases the divine life but also multiplies it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The shortage of life among the believers is due to the fact that we have not died enough to minister life to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life comes out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine life is within us, but how much this life is multiplied depends upon how much death we undergo.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more death we experience, the more life will be released from us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only death can bring about the multiplication of the divine life; power cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today s Christians devote their attention to power instead of to life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But only the death of Christ can multiply life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the unique grain of wheat, and we are the many grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our function we should be the same as Christ for His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we need to enjoy Christ as the grain of wheat by experiencing His life-releasing death for the multiplication of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Light</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verses 35, 36, and 46, we see that Christ is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verses 35 and 36, the Lord Jesus said to the crowd, The light is still among you a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you; and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While you have the light, believe into the light, so that you may become sons of light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 46, the Lord then said of Himself, I have come as a light into the world, that every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the Lord Jesus came to this world as the shining light that man might not remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the manifestation of God as light, and if people receive Him as light, they will have God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man believes into Him, he will not remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if a man refuses to receive Him as light, he simply rejects God and will be overcome by darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ comes as light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man receives Him, he will have God and will become one of the sons of light, the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here the Lord was making a declaration to the religious crowd that He is the manifestation of God coming to them as light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they receive Him, they will become sons of light, and if they do not receive Him, they will be overcome by darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is the light into whom we believe, that we may become sons of light who do not remain in darkness and are not overcome by darkness.</S>
