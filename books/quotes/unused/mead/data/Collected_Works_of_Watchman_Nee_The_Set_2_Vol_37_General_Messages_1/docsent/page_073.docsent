   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ON BEING A MEMBER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once a person has a feeling for the Body, he will see his place in the Body at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, he will see that he is only a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every member has its use.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A member is different from a cell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A body can survive without a cell, but it cannot survive without a member.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, every cell has its use too.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Bible tells us that we are members in the Body of Christ; we are not cells in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unfortunately, many Christians are like cells in the Body; they do not act like members.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They do not have any specific function in the Body of Christ, and they never take care of their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that their presence in the meeting is not indispensable and that nothing is missing when they are not there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not function in the Body because they have never seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They never realize their ministry when they are among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not see what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they see the Body, they will spontaneously see that they are members; they will realize that unless they minister life to the Body of Christ, the Body will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, none of us can be a passive member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we are a member of the Body, we cannot be passive, and we cannot be a bystander in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come to the meeting, we should realize that we are a member in the Body of Christ and that we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They may be audible prayers or silent prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we must at least pray and minister life to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some Christians are suppliers of life; once they come to a meeting, the meeting receives their supply even when they do not open their mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their very presence is a life supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever they go, death is swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, once we see the Body of Christ, we will inevitably see ourselves as members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As members severally of this Body, we should seek to profit the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should seek for ways to supply life and power to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if we do not open our mouth in the meeting, we should pray silently, and even if we do not speak, we should always be looking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is being Body-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we see the Body, we will no longer say that we are dispensable or unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we see the Body, we will say that we are a member of the Body and that we have a responsibility to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should speak, and we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we come to the meeting, we will do whatever God tells us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot be a bystander.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, if we see the Body, we will not act in any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we function this way, the life of the meeting will swallow up all death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many meetings do not have enough power because the presence of death is too strong; there are too many bystanders in these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you see the Body of Christ, you will also have the sensation that you are under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will feel that God's children are lovable, that division is wrong, and that fellowship is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will also feel that as a member of the Body of Christ, there are responsibilities that you have to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These feelings are feelings of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, once you feel that you are in the Body, you will feel that you are under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who feel that they are in the Body also feel that they are under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man knows the life of the Body of Christ, and if he is conscious of the fact that he is a member, he will also be conscious of the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, we must submit not only to the direct authority of the Head, but also to the indirect authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My arms are not only under the authority of my head; when my shoulders move, my arms move with them also.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My arms submit to the Head by submitting to the shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who see the Body of Christ surely see the need for submission to God's appointed authorities in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes someone will tell you to do something, and after you pray about it, you may feel that the Lord does not want you to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you act accordingly and put the matter aside, you feel happy; you feel that you have obeyed the Lord's word and that it was right for you not to listen to man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But more than once have you not felt that when you ignored the words of others, you were actually disobeying the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>More than once have you not felt that a person or a few persons really knew the Lord, and that the Lord had put them there to represent His authority, and that if you went against them, you would be going against the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you see the Body and see the authority of the Head, you will see that there are always one or more persons who are ahead of you in the Body, to whom you should submit yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only must you see the Head, you must also see those who represent the Head and realize that going against them is going against God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, if the Lord opens your eyes, you will see the Body, and you will see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why do the different parts of the human body always work harmoniously together?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The body is always one because there is authority in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the body is not upheld by authority, all the members will be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose the stomach is hungry and wants to eat, yet the mouth refuses to cooperate and to take in the food.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Can the body still survive?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as one part of the body rejects the authority of the body, the whole body will become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Cancerous tumors are dangerous diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These tumors grow when some cells of the body do not follow the law of the body and begin to grow independently.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The body does not need such growth, yet they continue to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They take away much of the nourishment of the body for their own growth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They only care for their own growth and do not care whether the body wants them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They do not submit to the authority of the body, and they act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more they grow, the more damage the body suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the end, a few insubordinate cells can kill the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Authority is the law of the body, while insubordination is a disease in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a man does not know authority, how can he say that he knows the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When three or five people come together, those who know the Body can always find who the authority is and to whom they should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everyone has his authority to whom he should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The hands submit to the arms, while the arms submit to the shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is something very spontaneous and comely.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if there are only three or five persons, if they practice this, they will see the Body of Christ manifested among them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many Christians speak carelessly and act carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They do not listen to others, and they think that they themselves are the greatest; it seems as if they have never found anyone to whom they can submit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This proves that they have never been restricted by the Body, and they have never submitted themselves to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May the Lord be merciful to these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we are truly dealt with by the Lord, if our flesh is truly touched, and if the "backbone" of our natural life is truly broken, we will immediately see that our hands and our mouth can no longer be free.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Body will restrict us, and we will no longer be able to rebel against God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord deliver us from mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May the Lord lead us on to a full knowledge of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May this feeling follow us all the time so that we no longer act according to our own will or live foolishly or carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we do this, we will receive a rich supply from the Body, and through the Body we will express the Lord's testimony on the earth.</S>
