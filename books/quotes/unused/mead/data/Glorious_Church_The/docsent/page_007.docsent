   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hebrews 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation, Psalm 8 speaks of God's will after man's fall, and Hebrews 2 speaks of God's will in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us look at Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will see that in the victory of redemption God still desires man to obtain authority and deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 5 through 8a the writer says, "For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that You bring him to mind?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or the son of man, that You care for him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet quoted from Psalm 8 .'</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All things must be subject to man; God purposed it from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it has not yet turned out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The writer continues, "But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him, but we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>8b-9a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is the person who fits this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 8 said that God made man a little lower than the angels, but the apostle changed the word "man" into "Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He explained that "man" refers to Jesus; it was Jesus who became a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man's redemption is by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God originally purposed that man should be a little lower than the angels and that man should be crowned and rule over all His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He intended for man to exercise authority on His behalf to cast out His enemy from the earth and from the heaven related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wanted man to destroy all of Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But man fell and did not take his place to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus came and took upon Him a body of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He became the "last Adam" 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last part of verse 9 says, "So that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The birth of the Lord Jesus, the human living of the Lord Jesus, as well as the redemption of the Lord Jesus show us that His redemptive work is not only for man, but for all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All creation except the angels is included.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus stood in two positions: to God He was the man at the beginning, the man whom God appointed from the very first, and to man He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning God assigned man to rule and overthrow Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus is that man, and that man is now enthroned!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a man has overthrown the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the man whom God is after and desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His other aspect, He is a man related to us; He is our Savior, the One who has dealt with the problem of sin in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We sinned and fell, and God made Him to be the propitiation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, He not only became the propitiation for us, but He was also judged for all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is proved by the splitting of the veil in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 10 tells us that the veil in the holy place signified the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Upon the veil were embroidered cherubim, which represent created things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time of the Lord's death, the veil was split in two from the top to the bottom; as a result, the cherubim embroidered upon it were simultaneously rent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This reveals that the death of the Lord Jesus included judgment for all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He not only tasted death for every man, but also for "everything."</S>
