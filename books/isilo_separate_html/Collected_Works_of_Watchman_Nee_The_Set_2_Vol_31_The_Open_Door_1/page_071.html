Most of the brothers and sisters have fled to Jou-Shan and are meeting there. The rest are all scattered in the mountainous counties: Dan-Ju-Wu, Ping-Shui, and Shang-Zao. I have heard that they are doing individual gospel work. Lo-Kou in Ping-Shui has already begun a (temporary) meeting. (2) The assembly in Jou-Shan has more than one hundred people. Many are new believers. Brother Wu Ting-chi and Brother Hsie Tze-yuen are responsible for preaching the gospel. We hope to have a conference for several days in the near future. Brother Hsie will be responsible for the Bible study, and I will bear the responsibility for preaching salvation. Please pray for this. (3) Hua-She: They have been in great difficulty physically, but God's grace is rich and has brought them through, and they manifest more of a heart of gratitude and are more spiritually alive. We preached the gospel from the first day to the third day of the Chinese New Year. I was responsible for the speaking. Thank the Lord, the result was not bad. (4) Hsia-Fang-Chiao: There are between thirty and fifty believers, but they have not begun the table meeting yet. They hope to have an edification conference. They are undergoing more physical suffering than those in Hua-She. Therefore, I have already talked with the responsible brothers in Hua-She about the grace they have received. They intend to share some of it with the assembly in Jia-Zao-Wan.</p><p>(5) Sha-Di: (A) Wan-An-Chiao: The church has improved very much. They are pursuing more deeply, and they have the greatest number. At the message meeting there are three or four hundred people. At the table meeting there are about two hundred. When Brother Luan came, they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Later, Brother Tang came to help them with deeper edification in life. We hope that there will be another outpouring of the Holy Spirit soon for all the new believers. (B) Tou-Peng: During the past three months, God has manifested special miracles and given the gifts of tongues, interpretations, and spiritual songs. The preaching has been with power. A brother, Chou Ah-fan, was completely healthy, but he was suddenly called to be with the Lord. Brother Chou loved the Lord most zealously. As a result of his death, a great revival broke out in the church, and the believers became very watchful. There were only joyful noises in the funeral. There was no sound of crying. Even the soldiers stationed there marveled when they saw it. The prayer of the sisters was especially spiritual. This is something I heard with my own ears. The meetings are a little quieter now. Probably the brothers are taking more roots in the spiritual life. (C) Jia- Zao-Wan: The believers are all poor, but they are very rich spiritually. One Lord's Day I conducted three meetings in the morning and evening. They were really hungry and thirsty. (D) San-Tai-Chiao: It is gradually being revived because some people have been going to the prayer meeting in Tou-Peng (Friday evening). (E) Ji-Shan-Chiao (or Yi-Rung): It is progressing steadily. Brother and Sister Kao Chi-luh are laboring there. (F) Sin-Wan-Di: A few brothers have been raised up by God. They preach the word with power and serve the Lord out of love, but they still pray for deeper edification. Brother Fei Chang-hwa asked Brother Chou Jing-tang to come and ask me to help them. How can an unworthy person like me help them? (G) Twelve Dai: God has already begun a work here. Perhaps there will be another local assembly and table soon. Last November and December, I went for three Lord's Days and held three private meetings. (H) Dang-Shan: At its invitation, Brother Kai-fen and I will go there next Lord's Day. Presently, it is still part of the China Inland Mission. May God bless this time of work. (I) Although there have been army corps in Si-Shing, Ning-Yuan, and Tien-Yuan many times, the believers' houses are still safe. They have not lost much. Brother Kao Jing-fu and I have agreed to go out together if there is an opportunity. We will go first to Liu-Li-Chiao, then to Kan-Shan, and finally to Si-Shing. There is a need in Liu-Li-Chiao and Kan-Shan, and Dang-Shan is about the same. (J) San-Cha-Dai: It is by the coast near Tou-Peng and San-Tai-Chiao. There has been an assembly in the Lord's name there for a long time, but the saints have not started the table meeting yet. Their condition is quite good, but they are somewhat immature.</p><p>The preceding is just a report of what I have heard and seen. May God give us the burden to pray for one another and to pray much for the assemblies in the localities mentioned above. The work in Sha-Di was worked out by the heavenly Father Himself, and God has worked through Brothers Luan, Shan, and Tang to revive, outpour, and establish the saints. The usual work of traveling around the area is done by Kao Chi-lu, Fei Chang-bao, Wang You-gen, and Kao Jing-fu. God has raised up many brothers to help. It really is true that God has mercy on whom He will have mercy. It is not of the one who runs the race, but of God who gives mercy. May glory and blessing be to Him forever! Amen. Peace to you! Greet the brothers and sisters in Shanghai!</p><p>Your little brother,<br /> Hu Ji-tang<br />February 3</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> </body></html>
