   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SOME WORDS FROM THE RESPONSIBLE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Collection of Newsletters is a publication for the circulating of news within the family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is absolutely not for the public and is available only to those brothers who walk with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We mail it to you because we trust that you are having fellowship with us and are sharing the responsibility of intercession with respect to the news contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We mail it to you because we trust that you will not publicize it to the ordinary people "outside the circle" but will call upon God for its sake "within the veil"!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also believe you understand that our work is spiritual and that our emphasis is life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are clear that God wants us to manifest the life of Christ in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the reality of our work is the life of Christ, and the outward expression of our work is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this present time, when the outward church is desolate, we do not have the slightest intention to start a new "movement," "group," "organization," or "denomination."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We dare not even call ourselves the churches in the various places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We stand only on the position of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This publication, therefore, carries the news of the assemblies which are standing on the position of the local church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As to its content, there is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have no headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning the localities, we have neither the power to control any of them nor the right to interfere with any of their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All that they have, they each have received from their Head, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fellowship of prayer and the direction in various matters are all mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This prayer and direction come about because of the need and through the Lord granting us the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The answers to all questions are spiritual, not official, and their source is gift, not position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not wish to be the "Diotrephes" among God's children, nor do we wish to become the class of Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All brothers who go out to work are sent by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are co-working with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We hope that you can bear some spiritual responsibility with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Witness Lee</S>
