O. Box 323, Shanghai, February 1939</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Turn in the Work<br />and in the Spiritual Condition,<br />Brother Hwa Tien-min, Kirin Province</h2><p>Brothers Ai-seng and Jia-teh:</p><p>I have had two meetings at Ju-Tzen. The situation is now very different. When we spoke the word before, we did not accompany it with faith. Even as we spoke, we did not believe that our audience would receive the grace that we spoke of. We spoke truth without flowing out grace. While I was in Peking and Jirin, the Lord gave me a special turn in the work and in my spiritual condition. He showed me that our teachings could not render help to the saints because of our very selves. The enemy had injected the image of the audience's evil condition into us and suppressed us to the point that we could not believe that they would receive grace. We did not wrestle with him on this point. Instead, we blamed the audience for their refusal and poverty. Should not those who refuse and who are poor be released? Should not the evil ones be saved? Yet many people were bound by our condemnation. We did not plunge into the spiritual warfare. As a result the unhealthy condition of the brothers was a weight upon us. We were powerless to release others or to sympathize with their poverty. On the contrary we condemned them and bound them, thinking that they did not deserve grace, and that this one and that one were bad. Actually, they had fallen into this condition because we conceded and accepted it. We were overcome by it. As a result, the devil created in the church the very condition which prevails in us. We blamed the brothers and sisters for lacking zeal, for not pursuing after the Lord, for not growing, for their rejection, and for taking the truth with the flesh. However, this condition existed because we first allowed the enemy to work on us to the extent that the truth became a loss to others instead of a blessing.</p><p>While I was in these two places, the Lord showed me again and again the vanity of the work. The work had no results, and the few who were able to understand our speaking were very poor. I was forced to seek the Lord again, realizing that if I continued on in this way, I would waste my whole life, and the brothers and sisters would be following after me in vain. Thank the Lord, He showed me that I had not been fully saved and therefore was unable to be a blessing to the church. The church does not lack truth but blessing.</p><p>Thank the Lord! During the past years, He has released much truth concerning victory and sanctification. This is much better than the vain teaching of exhorting men to do good. Yet the messengers of the church have not yet brought in the blessing, and the church is in desolation before our eyes. At the same time we are condemning the sin of the unsaved ones. Even some who take the same way as us are being set aside. When I realized this situation, I could only wail before the Lord, confessing that the Lord's rich grace has been limited by our narrowness. This rich salvation has been sealed up by us; we are not able to make many rich, and the poor fleshly ones and the ones who are in false spirituality are still bound by their condition. When I confessed these things to the Lord, He showed me the salvation of death and resurrection, and He showed me that I am already in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:22). The resulting condition of Adam's fall is finished. Now in resurrection and in Christ, our fallen condition is finished, and we have become God's children, full of love and mercy. Hallelujah! Only when we are in resurrection can we be manifested as the children of God, resurrected with a new image and a new likeness. The old image is finished in His death and the grave. Nothing of it comes out in resurrection. The image in resurrection is incorruptible, unchangeable, strong, and full of glory.</p><p>Dear ones, do not be afraid that the work might produce the flesh, and do not be afraid to discover what is impotent and poor. This fear is but an attempt to preserve the soul. We should do our best to uncover the poverty of the unresurrected state so that we can receive grace to enter into glory. Please note that faith in death and resurrection is not attained through self-effort in grasping hold of the truth, believing in death and resurrection, or appropriating the word of the Bible. Most people think that faith is man's duty and man's act. But the result is vanity. When the Holy Spirit reveals the unsanctified areas in us, we can only desire death and the experience of death and resurrection. There is no need to act in any way. All we have to do is wait for Him to act in our spirit.</p><p>I have been forced to the point where I must have this experience of resurrection. He has created a deeper faith in death and resurrection in my spirit. He has created a faith not only in resurrection but also in ascension and enthronement. First, He showed me the scene at the throne. The Lord manifested the condition of the throne on earth. (We experience His victory first, and then His enthronement.) When He needed the colt or the upper room (Mark 11:1-6; 14:14-16), He merely asked the disciples to take them and use them. Through His faith, all the evil power of men (the evil of rejecting the Lord, not being for the Lord, and being indifferent toward the Lord) was finished; it has all been overcome. This is the victory of the cross. He did not believe for one moment that the evil power of men or the operations of evil spirits existed before God anymore. Only this faith can release men and give them blessing.</p><p>Unfortunately, the poor condition of the brothers and sisters always looms over us. They have not been able to receive grace. We have not been able to dispense grace to them. We are subdued by the evil nature of men and by the result of the devil's operation. We have not brought the authority of the kingdom to earth and have not prevailed in the battle. All the nations should be blessed because of us. But first we must conquer man's evil power of rebellion against God. Then we can exercise the faith to bring in blessing.</p><p>We used to think that evil men and those believers who do not want the Lord are merely waiting for judgment. We did not believe that they could be saved or be turned to the Lord. Actually the faith that is upon the throne is a faith that believes that all of man's rebellion against God has been subdued by the victory of the cross; there is no more rebellion. Even the unbelievers should be working for the Lord; they should not be rebelling or be destined for perdition. In the past we allowed them to rebel, so they acted in opposition to God. The result was a curse. Now we are sitting on the throne. We have overcome and shattered the evil power of man and have subdued all the evil power that comes up against God's work. The evil condition of being against the Lord and of being ashamed of loving the Lord is gone and shattered. Everyone has to give his heart to the Lord. Everyone has to offer himself willingly to the Lord. Although this age is becoming more and more evil, the faith of God says that the glorious church is closer and closer to heaven. It may sound strange, but the fiercer the devil, the stronger our faith is in believing that his end is near. Although Lazarus was dead for four days and stank already and although it appeared to be hopeless, he was still living in the eyes of the Lord. Man's death cannot prevail against His resurrection. Although the Jews rejected Him, His faith was not weak; He still believed that the colt and the upper room were reserved for Him. In His eyes man's death (spiritual) and the devil's work are under His feet. This is kingship. This is enthronement. Hallelujah! This victory comes from man's active desire and is wrought through his spirit. Spontaneously, we inherit this faith. It is not something we acquire through strenuous effort in believing or through grasping hold of such a truth. It is something generated from within when our own activity ceases. Only that which is begotten of the Spirit is spirit. There is no activity of the self. Rather, everything issues from His Spirit through our will. Hallelujah!</p><p>Henceforth, we will see many people blessed, released, and seated in the heavenlies because of us. This faith turns that which is not being into being and calls that which is dead into life. It removes everything that is poor and dead, making the church full of riches, resurrection, consecration, love for the Lord, and the glory of God so that we are no longer ourselves but are the sons of God. May praise and glory be unto Him forever and ever! Amen. Peace be unto you.</p><p>Brother Hwa Tien-min, November 12, 1938</p><p>(This letter was sent to two brothers in Feng-Tien, who transferred it to us&mdash;Editor.)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
