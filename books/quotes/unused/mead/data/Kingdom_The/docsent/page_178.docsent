   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In verse 21, "His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This verse is not related to salvation but to a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Someone was invited into the joy of the lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The servant who received five talents was made ruler over many things, and he entered into the joy of his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, the servant who received two talents was also made ruler over many things, and he entered into the joy of his lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To enter into the joy of his lord does not refer to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means he received something as a reward in addition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning the slothful one, the lord said in verses 24-28: "And he also who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But his lord answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You ought therefore to have deposited my silver with the bankers, and when I came I would have recovered what is mine with interest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that salvation was taken away from the slothful one, but it does mean that he suffered because of his lack of diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are faithful servants using the talents that the Lord Jesus has given us, when He returns He will reward us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will assign us to rule as kings over many things, and He will invite us to participate in His joy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we are saved and then are slothful and not faithful to use the talents He has given us, when He comes back He will reckon with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that because you are saved there can be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There can be a real problem if you are not faithful in your service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is altogether possible that you will receive some punishment rather than a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must take heed to the pure Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't "dispensationalize" this chapter wholly to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CALVINISM AND ARMINIANISM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we need to consider two basic concepts or schools concerning the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One is the Calvinistic school, and the other is the Arminian school.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Calvinistic school teaches eternal security and believes in predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Calvinistic school we were predestinated before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we were born, we were called, we were justified, and we were saved according to God's election.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we are saved, we are eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No doubt this is absolutely right according to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many verses support the matter of predestination and eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus in John 10 said that once we receive eternal life, we can never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand the Calvinists are right concerning eternal security, but on the other hand, they are short of something because they have not seen Matthew 25:30.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have not seen that there could be some problem with a person after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They would wrongly say that this verse applies not to true believers, but to false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Arminian school does not believe in the eternal security of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to their teaching you may be saved in the morning and lost in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then after a few days you may be saved again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later you may be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to this concept people may be saved and lost many times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may call this "elevator salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When they are saved, they are going up; when they are lost, they are going down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In their experience they are going up and down many times; they are saved and lost many times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of concept is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have picked up verses concerning reward and punishment at the Lord's coming back and applied them to believers losing their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to their concept, for a person to suffer some punishment means he is lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be clear that all three of the servants mentioned in Matthew 25 are saved, but the last one suffered some punishment by being cast into the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forget the traditional teachings and come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible says all three are servants, and the Bible says that the third servant, because of his slothfulness, suffered some punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please read and even pray-read these verses in the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are you a servant with five talents, or two talents, or one talent?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all must be faithful to use the talents which the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Remember, one day the Lord Jesus will come, and He will reckon with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will have to hand over our talents and settle our accounts with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to be faithful to use what the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, at His coming back, at the manifestation of the kingdom, we will suffer some punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will not lose our salvation, but we will suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will surely miss reigning with the Lord during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the Lord have mercy upon all of us!</S>
