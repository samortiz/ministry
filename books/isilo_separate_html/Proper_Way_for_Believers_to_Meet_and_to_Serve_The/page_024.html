<p>The most obvious benefit to door-knocking is that we bring joy and peace to people (Luke 10:5-6). To door-knock is to be a fisher of men in order to gain all kinds of fish, including big fish, small fish, good fish, and bad fish. We may gain medical doctors and professors and also people who steal. Someone may be contemplating suicide when we knock on his door and lead him to salvation. A couple may be quarreling and considering separation, but they are united when we knock on their door. We have many such testimonies. The testimonies of the forty thousand newly baptized believers are very inspiring. Door-knocking is a great benefit to human society.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Specific Steps for Practicing Door-knocking</h2>
<p>Door-knocking should not be done in a light way. We have learned a great deal concerning this. Every time we door-knock, we need to be formed into groups of three people: one elderly person, one middle-aged person, and one younger person. We should also be properly attired. If three husky young men dressed like hippies go out together to knock on doors, no one would dare to open the door to them. However, if an elderly saint, especially a sister, would knock on the door, people would readily open the door to her. Once the door is opened, the younger saint can immediately step to the front and do the speaking. The speaking of a young sister is pleasant to the ears. Even if she does not speak very well, people will still listen. We should also consider what we should say. We should not use our own words; rather, we should say what we were taught in the training and use <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> A college professor in his sixties may listen to and be subdued by a young sister speaking in a logical manner. Eventually, he will be led like a lamb to be baptized. Sometimes the wife who has not yet believed will help fill the bathtub with water. Then the brother in the group should do the baptizing. Such a coordination is wonderful and effective.</p>
<p>If we would go out in this way to knock on doors, people will not reject us. Even if they do not accept us, they will still be pleasant. Those who accept us will be very grateful. When we invite people to come to us, we are the ones who are grateful. However, when we knock on people&rsquo;s doors, they will be grateful because we will deliver the gospel, the truth, and the Bible to them. We are not giving them something insignificant; rather, we are giving them the Lord&rsquo;s name, His salvation, and the Triune God. These are great gifts. Someone may refuse today, but tomorrow he may consider letting us come in and talk with him. Someone may not open the door today, but the Holy Spirit will work in him and cause him to think, &ldquo;These people come to preach the gospel; they are giving me Jesus. Jesus is not bad. He is better than Buddha. Moreover, the Bible is the best book, and it contains the highest truths. I should listen to them.&rdquo; Although he is not clear, he may have such thoughts.</p>
<p>The trainees are rich in experience. When someone opens the door, the faces of the trainees are beaming with smiles. They know that they are meeting a son of peace. There was a newly married couple who had moved into their new home, but they felt that they needed a religion. After comparing the different religions, they considered Christianity to be the best, but they did not know how to join. This couple was so happy when the trainees knocked on their door. The trainees told them, &ldquo;You do not have to go join a religion. We can come to your home. It is very convenient.&rdquo; Sometimes a person rejects the trainees the first time but five days later receives them. Sometimes people are so grateful that they give the trainees gifts. There are innumerable testimonies. We could not have such results if we had invited people to come and listen to the gospel.</p>
<p>For this reason, many trainees who have gone door-knocking have become &ldquo;addicted.&rdquo; Every night they must go out to knock on doors and lead two or three people to be baptized; otherwise, they feel as though they are missing something. They have tasted the joy of preaching the gospel. There is an elderly sister who is eighty-five years old; she goes out to knock on doors in coordination with the younger saints. Because of her age, manner, and attire, every door opens for her. After entering the house, the young sister speaks, the elderly sister sits to the side and prays softly, and the middle-aged brother nods his head. This is the secret to our practice of door-knocking.</p>
<p>One very important point is that those who go out must rely on the Holy Spirit. Before going out to knock on doors, the trainees must spend twenty minutes to pray, thoroughly confess their sins, and ask for the filling of the Holy Spirit. This brings blessing to their door-knocking. We have the real things&mdash;the truth and the gospel. Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses do not have the real things. Therefore, our door-knocking will be effective.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
