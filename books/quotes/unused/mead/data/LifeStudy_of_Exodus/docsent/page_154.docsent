   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DESTINY OF AMALEK A. The Remembrance of Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Be Blotted Out from under Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The destiny of Amalek, in the first place, is to have the remembrance of him blotted out from under heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 17:14 the Lord said unto Moses, I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No matter how strong, stubborn, or prevailing the flesh may be, its remembrance will be blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates God s hatred of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Romans 8:7 and 8, the flesh is an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It has neither the intention nor the ability to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the destiny of the flesh is to be blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Exodus, however, Amalek was not blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Samuel 15 we see that the Amalekites were still in existence and were quite prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, God has decided that the flesh must be blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will take place during the kingdom age in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today is still the time for us to fight against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when the kingdom comes, the flesh will be blotted out from under heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. God to Have War with Amalek</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>from Generation to Generation</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is so strong against the flesh because with Amalek there is a hand against the throne of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Exodus 17:16 says, For he said, Because there is a hand against the throne of Jehovah, Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The flesh is a hand against the throne, against the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the flesh opposes the throne of the Lord, the Lord must fight against it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The flesh is in rebellion against God and against His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh is most ugly simply because it is against the throne, administration, and plan of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, not many believers realize that the flesh is so evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The flesh does not simply commit minor wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a hand against the very throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the flesh is a hand against God s throne, God has decided to war against it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Amalek, the flesh, is still a hand against the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that our flesh is in rebellion against God s governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever God does governmentally, the flesh opposes it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, among many Christians the flesh is strongly opposed to the church, for the church is God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is mocked, and many blasphemous words are spoken concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is an indication that the flesh in the eyes of God is rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Truly the flesh is a hand against the throne of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Lord will fight against this rebel and blot out its remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. The Name of Jehovah-nissi</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Called at the Altar as a Memorial</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 17:15 we are told that Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The name Jehovah-nissi means Jehovah my banner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For Jehovah to be our banner means that Jehovah God is our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moses built an altar and then called the name of it Jehovah-nissi.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The altar signifies the cross, which deals with our flesh Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, our flesh must be blotted out; on the other hand, the cross must be a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By the cross we enjoy the victory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that by the altar we enjoy Jehovah-nissi.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The altar built and named by Moses in Exodus 17 signifies that the cross of Christ is a memorial of our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By the cross we experience the Lord as our banner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We enjoy Him as our victor, and we enjoy victory through the cross of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the book of Galatians, the flesh must be set aside, but the cross must become our boast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul declares that he did not boast in circumcision, but boasted in the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The remembrance of the flesh must be blotted out, and a memorial of the cross must be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to remember the cross of Christ through which we enjoy the Lord as our banner, our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This cross is the memorial that the flesh has been blotted out.</S>
