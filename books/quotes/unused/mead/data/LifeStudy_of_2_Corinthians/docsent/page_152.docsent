   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MAN IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to verses 2 through 5, Paul regards himself as two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 2 he says, I know a man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Referring to this man in Christ, he says in verse 5, On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The man in Christ in verse 2 is the apostle v. 7 , not as the old creation but as the new creation 5:17 . In this section the apostle desires to boast of the new creation in Christ by boasting of his weaknesses in the flesh, the old creation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The man in Christ mentioned in verse 2 was not Saul; it was Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Saul was the natural man, and Paul is the new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It would be good if we all had two names: a name to denote the person before we were saved, what we were in Adam, and a name of the person who is now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Formerly we were a Saul; now we are a Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some time ago I heard that one writer said that there were two William Laws.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first William Law was a man of doctrine, knowledge, theology, letter, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second William Law was a person of the Spirit and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first William Law did not know anything concerning the Spirit, although he had much knowledge of theology and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But one day he had a new beginning, and he became a person of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the one who improved upon the teachings of certain mystical writers and made those teachings practical.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that eventually William Law became a man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later Andrew Murray was helped by the writings of William Law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Paul speaks of a man in Christ, he is referring to his second man, to his second person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He would boast of this man, but he would not boast of the old self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 5 the word myself refers to Paul s old self, not to his new self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It refers to Saul, not to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s new self was altogether in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This man in Christ was a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would pay attention to ourselves as believers, we shall see that we also are two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, we are a person with an old self; on the other hand we are a person with a new self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This person is in Christ and is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should no longer care for the first person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, we should follow the second.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What happened to Paul, a man in Christ, as recorded in these verses, is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not even Paul was able to tell whether he was in the body or outside the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 3 he says, Whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know God knows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is certain that Paul did not go into a trance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not think that what is described here is the experience of someone in a trance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What happened to Paul was beyond his ability to express, for not even he himself was altogether clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PARADISE AND THE THIRD HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to verses 2 and 4, two things happened to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, he was caught away to the third heaven; second, he was caught away into Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 2 Paul says, I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know God knows , such a one was caught away to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Greek word rendered caught away here is the same word as in Acts 8:39 and 1 Thessalonians 4:17.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Literally the Greek word translated to means till within, that is, as far as.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The visible clouds may be considered the first heaven, and the sky, the second heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The third heaven must refer to the heaven of the heavens, the highest heaven Deut 10:14; Psa 148:4 , where the Lord Jesus and God are today Eph 4:10; Heb 4:14; 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Notice that verse 2 does not speak of Paul being caught up; it says that he was caught away to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is an important difference between being caught up and being caught away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Acts 8:39 Philip was caught away by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He knew that he was in the body when he was thus caught away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, Paul did not know whether he was in the body or outside the body when he was caught away to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The third heaven is a Hebrew expression denoting the highest heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have pointed out, the clouds may be regarded as the first heaven and the sky beyond the clouds as the second.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The third heaven, therefore, must be the heaven above the sky, in biblical terms, the heaven above the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today the Father and the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, are in this highest heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul was caught away to this highest heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verses 3 and 4 Paul continues, And I know such a man whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know God knows , that he was caught away into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed a man to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The conjunction and is an important word here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It indicates that what is mentioned in verses 3 and 4 is another matter in addition to what is mentioned in the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 2 tells us that the apostle was caught away to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now verses 3 and 4 tell us something further, that the apostle was also caught away to another place, into Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates strongly that Paradise is not synonymous with the third heaven in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It refers to a place other than the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many interpreters or expositors of the Bible regard the third heaven and Paradise as the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to their understanding, when Paul was caught away to the third heaven, he was also caught away to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, Paradise is not synonymous with the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The conjunction at the beginning of verse 3 indicates that here Paul is describing two different experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First, he was caught away to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then he was caught away to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paradise is the pleasant section in Hades, where the spirits of Abraham and all the just are, awaiting the resurrection Luke 16:22-23, 25-26 , and where the Lord Jesus went after His death and stayed until His resurrection Luke 23:43; Acts 2:24, 27, 31; Eph 4:9; Matt 12:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This Paradise differs from the Paradise in Revelation 2:7, which will be the New Jerusalem in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this section the apostle tells of the transcendence of the revelations he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the universe there are mainly three sections: the heavens, the earth, and Hades under the earth Eph 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a man living on earth, the apostle knows the things of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But men do not know the things either in the heavens or in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, the apostle was brought away to both of these unknown places.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, he received visions and revelations of these hidden regions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For this reason he mentions these two uttermost parts of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the Lord Jesus died, He did not go immediately to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, He went to a place called Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One of the thieves said to Him, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom Luke 23:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus answered, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise v. 43 . Furthermore, according to Acts chapter two, the Lord Jesus went to Hades after He died v. 31 . If we put together these two portions of the Word, we see that Paradise must be in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In Luke 16 we have a picture of the two sections of Hades, the section of comfort and the section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When Lazarus died, he went to the section of comfort, where Abraham was.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When the rich man died, he went to the section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Paradise, therefore, is the comfortable, restful section of Hades.</S>
