   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN CHRIST AS LIFE FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The writings of the Apostle John have a special place in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His Gospel is unique among the four Gospels, and Revelation, his last book, is the conclusion of the New Testament and of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these two books there are two words which are the key words not only to these books, but also to the whole of Scripture they are life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning of Scripture there is a tree called the tree of life, and at the end of Scripture there is a city, a building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is very clear that the building issues from the life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life is for the building, and the building comes out of the life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This life is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Triune God is life to us that the eternal building may be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two words summarize the whole revelation of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE DEFINITION OF LIFE AND BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Gospel of John, life and light are referred to continually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The end result of the life mentioned in John's Gospel is found in the book of Revelation that is, the building, the city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the center of this building is the tree of life, growing in the flow of the living water, to nourish and supply the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the last picture in Scripture reveals that the life is in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This life is God in Christ as the Spirit flowing out as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to this passage, the incarnated Christ is the very tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Revelation 21 John saw the holy city and heard a voice out of heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In these two books written by the same person, we see two tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the tabernacle in John's Gospel, and the holy city is the tabernacle in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second tabernacle, the New Jerusalem, is the enlargement of the first tabernacle, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is only one tabernacle, but it is manifested in two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the first stage, from the time of His incarnation to His death, Christ alone was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then came His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and entering into us as the Spirit, and we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we are being transformed, and eventually we will be completely transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time God's work will be completed; that will be the second stage of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tabernacle of the first stage, the Lord Jesus, will have increased to a tabernacle including millions of persons!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In that glorious day, Christ, who was the tabernacle in the first stage, will be the very center of the tabernacle in the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since Christ is the center in the New Jerusalem, there is no need of the sun or moon or any other kind of light in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God Himself is the light, and Christ is the lamp, the vessel to contain the light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the light, God is the glory, and as the lamp, Christ is the container and expression of the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The city itself is a great vessel to contain the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The lamp contains the light, and the city contains the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As an example, we may consider a common light bulb with its shade: first, there is the electricity within the bulb; second, there is the bulb, the container of the electricity; and third, there is the lampshade surrounding the bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Jerusalem as the lampshade is the enlargement of the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the tabernacle of God, and the church, the Body of Christ, is the enlargement of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE WAY OF ENLARGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How may this one tabernacle be so enlarged?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we learn how to properly study the Scripture, we will see the way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bride</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another expression of this tabernacle is the Bride of the Lamb Rev 21:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 3:29 tells us clearly that Christ will have a Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Jerusalem is this Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consider the case of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We see there how Eve, the bride of Adam, came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God created Adam, He formed just one person from the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Out of Adam He took a part, from which He formed Eve, and He brought her to Adam to be his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She was the increase or enlargement of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Strictly speaking, the wife is not a separate person from the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, she is the enlargement, the increase of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She is therefore the counterpart of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, the tabernacle is the Bride, the increase of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>John's Gospel makes this matter very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Many Grains</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While the third chapter of John presents the Bridegroom and the Bride, the twelfth chapter reveals the one grain of wheat which is multiplied into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the one grain which fell into the earth and died.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By death and resurrection the one grain is multiplied into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are the many grains produced from this one grain.</S>
