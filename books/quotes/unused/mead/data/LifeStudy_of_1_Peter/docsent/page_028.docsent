   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TEN PETER S WELL-SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:3-12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 1:3-12 is one long sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This long sentence is a blessing, a well-speaking, that involves the Trinity of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Peter speaks of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Beginning in verse 3, Peter mentions the Lord Jesus Christ, or Jesus Christ, again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the very end of this section, in verse 12, Peter speaks of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, this blessing is actually composed of the Trinity of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have one God, the unique, eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This unique God is complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But although God is uniquely one, He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who know Greek may not consider that Peter s composition is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible, however, is a matter of revelation, not of composition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These ten verses in 1 Peter 1 may not be good human composition, but they give us an excellent, marvelous, and wonderful divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>WHAT IT MEANS TO BLESS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:3 Peter uses the word blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul also uses this word in Ephesians 1:3: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Greek the word blessed means well spoken of, praised with adoration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, a blessing is a well-speaking, and to bless someone is to speak well of him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, to bless God is to speak well concerning Him and all that He is to us, has done for us, and will do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To bless God is to speak in a sweet way of what God is, of what He has done, and of what He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of speaking is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians think that to bless God is to praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This understanding of blessing certainly is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever you are about to praise God, you need to speak something about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in what way shall we praise God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A child may say, God, I praise You for giving me a good father, one who loves me and who earns a lot of money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God, I also praise You that my mother buys nice things for me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many Christians praise God mainly for material things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may say, Oh, blessed be God the Father!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praise Him for giving me a good business, a large house, and a nice family.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This falls far short of the revelation in 1:3-12.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Gradually the Lord has brought me into the thought of the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can testify that when I read such a verse as 1:3, I realize that to bless God the Father is to speak well of what God is to us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not merely to praise Him for what He has done for us or given to us objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To bless God the Father is to speak subjectively of what He is to us, of what He has done for us, and of what He will do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is to bless God according to what is revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These ten verses in chapter one of 1 Peter tell us what the Father has done for us through the Son and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father has done so much for us through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All that the Father has done for us through the Son is applied to us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to speak well regarding all these things.</S>
