   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What they ate was the manna from heaven Exo 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We who follow the Lord have God's manna from heaven, which is the Lord Jesus.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only did the Israelites need food in the wilderness; they needed water as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God solved the problem of their need for food by sending manna, but there was still the need to solve the problem of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For that, God commanded Moses to smite the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Out of the rock came water Exo 17:6 , and their thirst was quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today the Lord Jesus is our manna.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is also our living water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can drink of Him and be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Defeating Amalek</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While the Israelites were journeying in the wilderness, Amalek came and fought with them Exo 17:8 , hindering them from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through the prayer of Moses, the Israelites defeated Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In type, Amalek signifies our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our flesh is always hindering us from following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But through the intercession of the Lord Jesus in heaven and through the power of the Holy Spirit, we are enabled to overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, after we have left Egypt and are in the way of following the Lord in the wilderness, there are many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is able to meet all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He turns the difficulties into sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He satisfies our hunger and quenches our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He overcomes the hindrance of the flesh for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way we can go on fearlessly to the place God has appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Coming to the Mountain Appointed by God, Receiving Revelation, and Erecting the Tabernacle</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here they received the revelation to build the tabernacle so that God would have a dwelling place on earth Exo 25:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later the tabernacle became the center of the move among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This typifies that we the believers are led by the Lord to receive revelation and to build the church as God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wandering and Dying in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Israelites could very well have entered into the good land of Canaan through following the tabernacle had it not been for their evil heart of unbelief which offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For that, God was disgusted with that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the end they all died in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This typifies the believers wandering and failing in the soul.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years until a new generation rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God brought the new generation through the river Jordan to enter into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He ordered Joshua to choose twelve men from the people to bring twelve stones from the river Jordan over to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, they set up twelve stones in the river Josh 4:2, 8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was done as a symbol that the old Israelites were buried under the river Jordan and that the new Israelites were brought through the river into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This typifies that the believers' natural life passes through the death of Christ, and in resurrection they enjoy Christ as the good land.</S>
