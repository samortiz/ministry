   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: When a brother's peculiarity comes out in a certain situation, is it right to speak to him to expose his peculiarity?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: As long as we sense others' peculiarity, our sensing is also a peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we react in this situation, our reaction is in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not react.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are under the killing of the cross, we will not have any reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not have a negative sensation about the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be "blind" and "deaf."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not see anything, hear anything, or sense anything because we are walking according to spirit and are under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we have a negative consideration about someone, this indicates that we are not walking according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we may have a responsibility to help a brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must be led by the Lord that we can speak to them what the Lord wants to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: Sometimes I have been offended by someone's peculiarity, but after speaking to them about it, I feel better.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is this right?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer: If we are offended, our being offended is a peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As proper Christians we should not have a feeling or sensation that anyone has offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this sense, we should be like a piece of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If someone kicks or beats a stone, it will have no feeling because it is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We, however, are very "living."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we must be killed by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are killed by the cross, no one will be able to offend us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we all practice to walk according to spirit, our church life will become the New Jerusalem in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if we are too sensitive and become offended with each other, the church life will be in turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to experience the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: Since asking whether we are in the spirit or in the mind may cause us to fall into our mind, how should we practice hesitating before we do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: We must practice not to analyze but simply to act, walk, and have our being according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To analyze is to turn back and stay in our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before we do something, we should hesitate and check with the Lord, "Am I doing this, or are You doing it with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then if we feel that He is doing it with us, we should go ahead; but if we feel it is only we, we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Question: When I do not know what to do in a situation, often I pray very much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is this the way to remain in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Answer: We must learn to practice walking according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether or not we pray is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do pray, we have to pray according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes the Lord wants us to stop our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may pray much, but the prayer may not be according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Walking according to spirit is a very thorough practice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It implies behaving, acting, speaking, going places, and having our being according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The key to living the Christian life is to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Question: Does walking according to spirit mean that before we do or say anything we hesitate and ask the Lord, "Is this You?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Answer: In order to walk according to spirit, we should not do things too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should hesitate a little.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot say that to hesitate is to walk according to spirit, but to hesitate helps us to walk according to spirit.</S>
