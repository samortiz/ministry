   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I thank God that formerly I was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I, Watchman Nee, was not asking to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I rejected and opposed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But unexpectedly, God brought me through and caused me to accept the word which I had formerly rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God took me and gave me to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once I was given, I no longer had any way to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God gave me to the Lord, I received Him as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From that day on, I was in the Lord's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since we have been given by God and received by the Lord Jesus, how can we escape?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it were we working by ourselves, and if it were we trying and striving to save ourselves, a little negligence or carelessness and we would be through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we must realize that it is God who has given us to the Lord Jesus and who has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let me give you a somewhat imperfect illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that recently Szechuan had a very severe famine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I read many reports concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Children two years old, who could not even talk yet, were stretching forth their little hands to beg.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They begged for food and clothing and maintained their livelihood through begging on the street; they had no other way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose there was a rich person who had plenty of food and clothing at home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I delivered one of these children over to such a person, in reference to the material things, the child could be said to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once I give the child over, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, we the sinners were dead in sin and perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But as soon as God gave us over to the Lord Jesus, we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be saved means to be given over by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While we were dead in sin and were waiting for judgment under condemnation, God gave us over.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This has nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since God has received you, He could not forsake you again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You were a lost person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You had neither food nor clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God gave you to the Lord Jesus, and He received you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How could you be cast out again now?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no way it can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has given, and the Lord Jesus has received.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said that whoever comes to Him will not be forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whoever is given to Him by God will not be forsaken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, there is no way for such a one to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you were able to perish, it would mean that God would not be consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has already given over; and the Lord Jesus has already received.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can you perish?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would be a miracle if it were again possible for you to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can say to God, "God, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was a sinner; I was dead in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While I was yet a sinner, I had no desire to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But You gave me over, and the Lord Jesus has received me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once You have given me over, and He has received me, I cannot help but be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus said, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The phrase "by no means" in the original language is very emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It means regardless of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"By no means" is a strong expression, but because of our familiarity with the words, we do not pay so much attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It means regardless of any reason, the Lord will not forsake us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is absolutely not a single Christian whom He has forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are saved because of the Lord Jesus; we can continue in our salvation and be preserved in our salvation also because of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we think that salvation is of the Lord but that preservation is of ourselves, we will discover that no one can preserve himself for even a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am putting aside man; I am putting down man, but I am exalting the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything is accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a gift; it is a present.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will never be forsaken.</S>
