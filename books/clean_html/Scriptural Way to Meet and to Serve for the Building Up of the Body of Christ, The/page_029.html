<h2 class="head2">A Teaching</h2>
<p>We may also speak in the meetings according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching by presenting a teaching. Teaching covers a broad field, but we should not go beyond the limit of the teaching of the apostles. We always should be limited and controlled by the teaching of the apostles. We should not try to invent new kinds of teachings. We must always stick ourselves to the New Testament in our teaching concerning any matter. Even concerning a matter like our dress, we have to give a teaching based upon what is taught in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Many of us may be deeply stirred up and very burdened to carry out the God-ordained way. But we should not claim too much freedom in what we speak. We have no liberty to speak anything in the meeting that crosses over the limiting line of the apostles&rsquo; teaching. We must be within this line and should always keep this in mind. Otherwise, we will be the creators of all kinds of confusions and divisions. This is why I am setting the limits in this chapter. We are open to any speaking within the limit of the teaching of the apostles, but we want to bury anything that does not correspond with this unique teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Revelation</h2>
<p>We may also present a revelation in the proper Christian meeting. Any revelation today must be within the limit of the apostles&rsquo; teaching because the divine revelation from Genesis to Revelation has been fully completed. This means that God&rsquo;s divine oracle has been fully completed. There are not any other new points or new thoughts outside of this divine oracle. If a so-called Christian revelation is beyond the teaching of the apostles, that revelation is not from God but is heresy. Whatever revelation we receive should be compared with the apostles&rsquo; teaching and should be limited by it. Mrs. White, the chief leader of the Seventh Day Adventists, fell into error by claiming that she received new revelations from God. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormons, also claimed that he received new revelations, but the so-called revelations received by him were great heresies. Our revelation must be limited and controlled by the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The first amendment to the Bill of Rights concerning freedom of speech stands out in the United States. Those of us who live in the United States may feel that we have the right to say anything. When we open our meeting in the new way to all the saints, this opens the door to all kinds of things. The New Jerusalem has a great and high wall (Rev. 21:12), but it may seem that there is no wall in our meeting. I am concerned that some &ldquo;free speechers&rdquo; will come in to speak whatever they think is a revelation. They may say that they have received a revelation based upon what Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians 14:26. This is why Paul says in the same chapter that when two or three prophets speak, the others should discern (v. 29). When a prophet speaks, we have to be sober and learn how to discern. If a brother opens the Bible, reads a verse, and speaks based upon this verse, there is no danger of any heresy. But if a person stands up and claims he has received a new revelation, we have to be careful to discern his revelation according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. In this way we can guard our meeting from being invaded by different revelations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Exhortation and an Admonition</h2>
<p>In the apostles&rsquo; teaching, exhortation is also included (Heb. 10:25). Thank the Lord that in the apostles&rsquo; writings, that is, in the New Testament, there are many adequate exhortations. We do not need to invent new exhortations. All the exhortations we need are already in the New Testament. We may also speak an admonition in the meeting according to the teaching of the apostles (Col. 3:16). We do not need to invent new admonitions, but we should always adhere to the New Testament teaching.</p>
