<h1 class="title">TALKS CONCERNING<br />
THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FORMING ALLIANCES<br />
WITH OTHER CHRISTIAN GROUPS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I acknowledge that your group is closest to God&rsquo;s will; hence, I am willing to fellowship with your group. However, I also have a work, and I speak with other Christian groups because my commission is to work in alliance with Christians in general. What is your view of my commission, and why does your group not form alliances with other Christian groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This matter is related to God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church on the earth today. It is not easy to explain, because most of God&rsquo;s children do not have revelation concerning God&rsquo;s purpose. However, I would like to briefly mention a few points.</p>
<p>First, according to the revelation in the Scriptures, the proper expression of the church, which God desires to gain in this age and in every place, is entirely different from the present condition of Christianity. In other words, the condition of Christianity is altogether not according to God&rsquo;s intention. According to the biblical revelation, there is and can be only one expression of the church in each locality. This unique expression within a locality is the representation in that locality of the one universal church, and its purpose is to carry out the proper function of the Body of Christ. However, today the condition of Christianity is absolutely not according to God&rsquo;s intention. Hence, we truly hope that we will be able to accomplish this matter for the Lord.</p>
<p>Second, we feel that God raised us up in the Far East, especially among the Chinese-speaking population, for the purpose of gaining the expression of the church that He desires. When we say this word, we are cautious and fearful, because we deeply sense that in uttering such a word, we may seem to be proud. Actually, we realize that we are so small and unworthy that we hardly dare to say such a word; nevertheless, based upon the desire in our heart and the truth, we feel that we must speak this word.</p>
<p>Third, because we have this feeling, for the past thirty years we have been in fear and trembling lest we neglect God&rsquo;s intention. For this reason, although there are many things that other people like to do and have the boldness to do, we dare not do them. This is not due to a desire to show that we are different but because of a forbidding, a fear, and an uneasiness within us that causes us to be unable to adopt the same attitudes and actions as others. On our part, we should never care simply for doing things properly, while ignoring whether or not God even desires these things.</p>
<p>Fourth, many in Christianity who are orthodox in their beliefs and who are zealous for the gospel are promoting alliances and cooperation among believers. Their intention is good, but the nature of these alliances is unavoidably contrary to the oneness of the church. The oneness of the church is the oneness of the believers in Christ and in the Holy Spirit, without the differences of sects. However, the distinction of sects remains in the alliances and cooperation that people are promoting. People are trying to form alliances and cooperate with one another while remaining in their sects. This is a compromise; it is an attempt to shake hands over a wall. This is not the absolute oneness but a hindrance to the genuine oneness of the church. It distorts the testimony of the church and sacrifices the Lord&rsquo;s interest. We feel that this kind of alliance and cooperation is not of the Lord; it is not His desire. We do not want to participate in such alliances in order to maintain the testimony for which the Lord wants us to stand. When we say this, it seems that we are professing to be different and higher than others. However, the fact is that we have no alternative. It is not our intention to profess to be different or higher than others.</p>
<p>Fifth, we feel that what we are doing is not only for ourselves but for all Christians, for the entire Body of Christ. We deeply realize that in this age God needs some to take the lead to follow Him with all their heart so that He can present a testimony that is pure and of a high standard. We dare not say that we are able to do such a thing, but we truly feel that this burden is upon us, constraining us to carry it out. Whether we can accomplish this matter depends upon God&rsquo;s mercy to us and whether we are faithful to Him.</p>
<p>Sixth, we are quite provoked by the past history and present condition of Christianity. Therefore, it is difficult for us to trust the works and activities of Christianity, as well as the organization of its groups. The history of Christianity and the existing practices in Christianity cause us to lose faith in this kind of alliance. Although a good number of its works and activities, as well as the organization of its groups, may appear to be good and pure, if we investigate them further and look at them from other angles, we will see that these works and activities still involve a number of impure factors. As a result, because we believe that the Lord raised us up for the purpose of maintaining a high standard for His testimony, we should not be involved with such impure factors and lower the Lord&rsquo;s standard.</p>
<p>Seventh, due to the above reasons, we do not encourage the brothers and sisters to participate in any work or activity in Christianity or to be involved with any organized Christian group.</p>
<p>Eighth, we confess that our Lord is great and that He is sovereign. Under His sovereignty He can use many saints who have a ground that is different from ours to do a good work for Him. We acknowledge that the Lord uses many, even those in the Catholic Church. This fact is clearly proved by history, and no one can deny it. Even though we strongly criticize the Catholic Church, we do not deny what history has proved. The Lord is so great that even Nebuchadnezzar, a king of Babylon who greatly opposed Him, was His servant and was used by Him.</p>
<p>As those used by the Lord, we need to consider what category we are in. Not all whom the Lord uses are pleasing to Him, and not all of their works are according to His will. Nevertheless, they are under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty for His interest. Hence, although we do not approve of or encourage the brothers and sisters&rsquo; participation in any work or activity in Christianity or their involvement with any organized Christian group, we do not oppose these groups, because we are afraid that we will damage or hinder the sovereign work that God is doing for Himself.</p>
<p>Ninth, the brothers and sisters&rsquo; attitude toward the work and activity in Christianity, as well as its organized groups, is a matter that we leave entirely up to the brothers and sisters and the leading that they receive from the Lord. We do not approve, encourage, or interfere. We cannot and do not want to control anything.</p>
<p>Tenth, people in Protestantism, especially the missionaries, seem to have an unfair view. In their view, Catholicism should be forsaken and isolated, but Protestantism should not be forsaken or isolated. However, we do not recognize the Catholic Church, and neither do we recognize the Protestant churches. In principle, according to our view, the Protestant churches are no different than the Catholic Church. Although they differ in degree, they are the same in principle. Therefore, in terms of principle, just as we do not want to have any part in Catholicism, we also do not want to have any part in Protestantism.</p>
<p>Today people in Protestantism do not want and will not have a part in Catholicism, but they blame us for not having a part in Protestantism. If people in Protestantism blame us for not participating in or uniting with Protestantism, we must ask them why they refuse to participate in or unite with Catholicism. It is the same in principle. The reason they do not participate in or unite with Catholicism is the very reason that we do not participate in or unite with Protestantism. We cannot do anything in regard to Catholicism, and we also cannot do anything in regard to Protestantism. We only want to walk before the Lord in a humble and simple way according to the enlightenment that we have received.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
