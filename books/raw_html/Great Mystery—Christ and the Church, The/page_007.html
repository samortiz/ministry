<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN US BEING THE HOPE OF GLORY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12, 15, 18-19, 25-27; 2:2-3, 9-10, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEEP MYSTERY IN COLOSSIANS AND EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>Bible scholars know that in the New Testament there is one book focused on Christ and one book focused on the church. However, most people stop with only this revelation; they do not see the deep mystery in these two books.</p>
<p>Because I was taught at a young age that Colossians is on Christ and Ephesians is on the church, I read these two books from this perspective. Even though I read these books many times and even divided the verses into sections, I saw only the revelation on the surface; I did not touch the deep mystery. In my study I did not mention the word <em>mystery,</em> because I did not see it. Even though I saw many crucial points in these two books, such as the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination, our being saved by grace, and our putting on the whole armor of God, I did not see the mystery.</p>
<p>Like most people, we have a common problem: when reading a book, we see and quickly comprehend what we already know, but we neither see nor comprehend unfamiliar things. The reason we neither see nor understand the word <em>mystery</em> is that we are unfamiliar with it. In order to speed-read a book, for example, a person must be familiar with the material; otherwise, it is difficult to read even one sentence.</p>
<p>Ephesians is on the church as the mystery of Christ, but people have read this book many times without seeing the church as the mystery of Christ. Instead, they see that husbands need to love their wives and that wives need to be subject to their own husbands (5:25, 22). It is remarkable that sisters do not see &ldquo;wives, be subject to your own husbands&rdquo;; instead, they are impressed with &ldquo;husbands, love your wives.&rdquo; Every sister says Amen when she reads Ephesians 5:25; she would even pray for her husband according to this verse. It is equally remarkable that when the brothers read Ephesians 5, they are impressed with &ldquo;wives, be subject to your own husbands&rdquo; (v. 22). Every brother says Amen to this verse and even prays, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for giving this word. Please enlighten my wife to see that she needs to submit.&rdquo; However, Ephesians 5 concerns a mystery: &ldquo;this mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church&rdquo; (v. 32). Because this word is not in the concepts of the brothers and the sisters, they do not see it.</p>
<p>It is easy to see the revelation on the surface, but it is difficult to touch the deep mystery. If the Lord did not have mercy on us and give us a sincere heart and a willingness to pay the price, we would spend our whole lives as superficial Christians who know only the revelation on the surface. The revelation on the surface cannot accomplish God&rsquo;s intention. His intention is in the deep mystery. Nearly two thousand years ago the Lord said, &ldquo;I come quickly&rdquo; (Rev. 22:20), but He still has not come. This proves that His desire has not yet been fulfilled. Over the past two thousand years, millions have been saved who love the Lord, read the Bible, and know the revelation on the surface. But according to church history, few believers have seen the deep mystery. Therefore, the Lord is still waiting. The Lord no longer wants us to give messages concerning the revelation on the surface; hence, we stopped giving such messages more than forty years ago. I am not being proud to say that I have much to speak concerning prophecies and types, but for forty years I have not had the burden to speak concerning such things. Instead, I have spoken on these two mysteries: the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ. If I am not speaking concerning these two mysteries, I do not have anything to say.</p>
<p>Christians in the West like the book of Psalms; therefore, when the New Testament is printed in the West, Psalms is included at the end. The New Testaments that are printed in China include Psalms and Proverbs. The Chinese love Proverbs more than Psalms, because the Chinese love maxims, and Proverbs is a book of maxims. If I were to print the New Testament, I would not include Psalms or Proverbs. Instead, I would typeset Colossians and Ephesians with a large font type and use a small font type for all the other books. Furthermore, Colossians would be in red, and Ephesians would be in green; red refers to Christ, and green refers to the church. I would also highlight every occurrence of the word <em>mystery</em> in these two books. However, the verses concerning ethics and morality in Ephesians, such as husbands loving their wives and wives being subject to their husbands, would be typeset in an outline font type. We need a Bible in which the beginning, the ending, the emphases, and the minor points are clearly indicated. Most people are confused concerning the beginning, the ending, the emphases, and the minor points in the Bible. For this reason, our concepts need to be corrected.</p>
<p>Some may say that it is wrong for me as a teacher of the Bible not to speak concerning ethics and morality. However, I would say that people have the wrong understanding of morality. Love is the highest expression of morality; it is the first virtue. The Bible says that God is love (1 John 4:8). Therefore, real morality is God. Man has morals because he is made in God&rsquo;s image (Gen. 1:26). God is love, and love is the image of God. In fact, every virtue is God Himself. Without God, every virtue is but a shell without any content. Only God is the reality of morality.</p>
<p>Confucius said that the way of great learning is to develop the bright virtue. This implies that the highest morality is the development of the bright virtue. The bright virtue of Confucius is the God-created conscience within man. To make known and magnify the conscience are to develop the bright virtue; that is, to develop the bright virtue is to magnify the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good. The innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good were created within man by God. However, they are merely an image, just as a glove is in the image of a hand. The innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good are but a glove, and only God can be the content. God is the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; that must enter into man. Confucius did not know this revelation. He did not know that unless a person is saved, his conscience lacks the real content, is empty, and cannot be developed.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
