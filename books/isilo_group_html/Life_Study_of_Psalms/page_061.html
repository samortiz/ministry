In His Ascension</H2><P>Psalm 16 finally reveals the God-man, Christ, in His ascension (v. 11b & c; Acts 2:28b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. In God's Presence Participating in Fullness of Joy</H2><P>Christ is in God's presence participating in fullness of joy, indicating that Christ has ascended to the heavens for His attainments and His obtainments (Psa. 16:11b; Acts 1:11; Phil. 2:9-11). In His ascension, among many other things, He attained to the kingship, to the lordship, and to the ruling leadership and the qualification of being a Savior to save others (Acts 5:31). He also obtained many things in His ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. In God's Right Hand Enjoying Pleasures Forever</H2><P>In His ascension Christ is enjoying pleasures forever in God's right hand, indicating that Christ is also at the right hand of God in His ascension to surpass all for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy concerning the church, the Body of Christ (Psa. 16:11c; Eph. 1:20b-23). This is the wonderful God-man portrayed in Psalm 16.</P><P>We need to see the divine revelation of this wonderful person in the Psalms. We may be like the blind man who was healed by the Lord in Mark 8. After the Lord laid His hands on him, He asked this man if he saw anything. The blind man responded that he saw men as trees, walking. The Lord had to lay His hands upon this man again so that he could see clearly (vv. 22-25). We may be like this man because our eyes are not fully open yet. But as we get into the Psalms week by week, our eyes are becoming more open, and we are seeing more and more.</P><P>Our eyes need to be opened until we have a full vision, a full revelation, concerning this wonderful person. He is the Word of God, even God Himself. In eternity past, He was full of divinity without any humanity. But one day in time He came to be incarnated and put on humanity. He became a God-man with a human body and lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He entered into death to accomplish God's redemption according to God's eternal plan, God's economy.</P><P>Christ came out of death and entered into resurrection. In this resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity to be begotten of God to become God's firstborn Son, and God regenerated all His believers to be God's many sons. Furthermore, in resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He is now within His believers as their life and their life supply.</P><P>He ascended to the heavens to attain many positions and to obtain many qualifications. In His ascension He became the Lord, the King, the Ruler, the Savior, and even the Christ for the accomplishment of God's economy that God could produce an organism, that is, the Body of Christ in resurrection as the church.</P><P>This is the Christ revealed in Psalm 16. This is the man that can sojourn in God's temple and dwell on God's holy mountain. Such a man is not a good man according to the law, but a God-man according to God Himself as the life and life supply.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
