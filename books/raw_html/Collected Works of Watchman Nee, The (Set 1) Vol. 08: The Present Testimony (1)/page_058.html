<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18</H2><P>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>This issue will be the last issue of this magazine for this year. Next year we will continue to publish this paper, and we will continue to distribute it free of charge. But our hope is that every copy will fall into the hands of those who really want to read it. For this reason, we have the following requests:</P><P>(1) We ask all those who would like to read it to please continue to pray for us. (2) Those who do not want to read it should please write to us to stop mailing it to them next year. Also, please give us the code number on the wrapping. You are not embarrassing us by telling us to stop mailing; rather, you are helping us to save some wasted efforts.</P><P>We thank God that Brother Watchman Nee's health has been greatly blessed by God. He does not have any plan of his own; he is looking to God's plan. Next year he will be able to meet with the readers through these columns again. By then we will also say something concerning the work ahead and our condition here. We ask the concerned brothers and sisters to thank God for us and to continue to pray for us.</P><P>All our publications which are marked Not for Sale are free for reprints and extracts. However, we ask those who are reprinting or making extracts of our writings not to sell them at a price or print them in regularly-priced publications. They must also be Not for Sale items.</P><P>Back issues of this paper and back issues of Notes on Scriptural Messages are out of stock; we have given them all away. Those who have them should keep them well. We apologize for not being able to make up the missing ones. May God bless you!</P><P>Shanghai<br>November 21, 1930</P>
