   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TESTIMONY OF BROTHER SAMUEL CHANG</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following is a testimony of Samuel I.L. Chang, Mrs. Nee's brother, concerning Watchman as a businessman:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I received my college degree in the field of chemistry, and in 1938 I engaged in the pharmaceutical enterprise as an assistant to Watchman Nee's second brother, Hwai-tsu George .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the time Watchman Nee began to manage the enterprise late in 1939, I worked with him for about ten years, until I left the China mainland in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Due to the Japanese invasion, our factory was moved from Shanghai to Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1943 Watchman Nee went back to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time he cabled me to come there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After arriving, he told me that there was a brother who needed approximately ten thousand dollars to clear his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was quite puzzled at the time that he was exercising such generosity to unconditionally pay off this brother's large debt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this incident made me clear that he was running the business, not for his own needs, but for the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes the Lord provided for Watchman's needs; sometimes He did not provide.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he would work with his own hands to supply his own needs as well as the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As time went on, the restriction on obtaining raw materials from abroad became acute, and there was no way to develop the pharmaceutical business on a large scale.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints still needed to be provided for, yet the income was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This situation forced Watchman to work at a government job in order to not become a burden to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He worked not only in order to provide help for others but also to meet the need of his own living expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the war he returned to Shanghai with the pharmaceutical factory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He built the business on a sound foundation, and there was such blessing from the Lord that another factory, which produced dye, was added to the business.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the financial blessing of these two factories, Watchman was able to offer a large sum to the church in Shanghai for the building of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was also able to maintain the training center on Mount Kuling, Foochow, with a number of living quarters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe I was the only one with him from the beginning to the end of his time in business.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can bear witness that his motive was absolutely not to make himself rich.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was utterly captured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although he was criticized for going into business, I must testify that he did not spend the profit for his own enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The money he made was for the Lord, and he spent it in the way the Lord desired.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of his rich experience in the Lord, he was enabled to work with government officials in a very efficient way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All his superiors admired him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He never attempted to prove that he was superior; rather, he lived and worked in the spirit of submission and took orders from those above him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, when the war was over and the government returned to Nanking, he was offered a high position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, because of his relationship with the Lord and his ministry with the co-workers and the churches, it was necessary to give up the government job.</S>
