   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST, HIS DEATH, AND HIS RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CONVEYING NOURISHING AND KILLING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see what the elements in the word are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we eat food, we spontaneously take in the vitamins that are in the food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The natural antibiotics in our food kill the negative germs within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our food also contains nourishing elements, which supply the exact needs of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our energy and strength come from these nourishing elements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After entering into our body, our food is processed through metabolism, which includes catabolism, a breaking down, and anabolism, a building up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Catabolism is destructive and is therefore a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anabolism is constructive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Daily receiving the word produces in us a spiritual metabolism, which on one hand destroys the negative elements and on the other hand builds us up spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all need such a metabolism to grow in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible contains many histories, prophecies, parables, types, and exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These may be likened to different dishes, but they are not the basic elements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The basic elements in a sandwich are flour, meat, and vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These same three elements may be used to prepare many different dishes, such as Chinese dumplings and Italian spaghetti.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These dishes differ only in form; in essence they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word of the Bible is also composed of three basic elements Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time we come to the Bible, we receive these three elements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether we read histories, parables, prophecies, exhortations, psalms, or proverbs, we receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the nourishing element in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Christ there is the killing of His death, which may be likened to catabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ s death destroys our self, flesh, lusts, selfishness, and natural concepts and emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every day we need to be under this destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every portion of the Bible conveys the killing of Christ s death to deal with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This killing is the effectiveness of the death of Christ, which has been compounded in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The killing element of Christ s death is typified by the salt in the meal offering described in Leviticus 2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The frankincense in the meal offering signifies Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the meal offering there is no honey, which typifies natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fine flour in the meal offering signifies Christ Himself with His fine humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In every portion in the Bible the basic elements are Christ, the killing of His death, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The killing of Christ s death and the building up of His resurrection received through the word produce in us a healthy spiritual metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE WAY OF LIFE ORDAINED BY GOD IN HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The experience of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion and the transmission of Christ through the word and the Spirit are the way of life ordained by God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, God s enemy has brought in many other things to replace these simple life matters among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For instance, many activities have come in. Even Bible reading becomes an activity if we set aside only one or two weeks per year to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our physical eating is not an occasional activity or organized movement but a daily life necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping are not special activities but legalities, or necessities, of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Reading the Bible is our spiritual eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Preaching the gospel also should not become an activity that is different from our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The proper gospel preaching is our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to live the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to God s economy, gospel preaching is fruit-bearing John 15:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As branches of Christ the vine, we do not need any activity, movement, schedule, or plan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will spontaneously produce fruit if we daily live and grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fruit is the spontaneous outflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not an activity but a living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many whom we contact in our daily life observe how we live.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we live Christ, some may outwardly despise us, but deep within they will know that we are a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our living is a shining testimony of Jesus, when a family member, neighbor, colleague, or classmate goes through a difficult situation, he or she may remember us and invite us for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we go, we may only need to speak a few words to lead the person to pray to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To bear fruit in this way is possible for every believer, and this way is more effective than large gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If an ordinary believer simply lives Christ, many of the ones he or she knows will eventually turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those we gain for the Lord in this way will be remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This way is easy, normal, and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The crucial point is that we all need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Living Christ to spontaneously bear fruit is the way of the Lord s recovery, for this is what was practiced in the beginning of the church life in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The hundred and twenty in Acts 1:15 did not have a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They were praying together v. 14 when the Spirit was suddenly poured out on the day of Pentecost 2:1-4 . The early believers did not have a plan to go to Samaria in chapter 8; only Philip was led to go there vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In chapter 13 the brothers in Antioch did not have a plan to go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 2 says, As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Barnabas and Saul were called and sent v. 3 , but they did not plan where they would go.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then in Act 16 Paul was at the western tip of Asia Minor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to go in two other directions, Paul saw a vision of a man entreating him to come over into Macedonia, which was across the Aegean Sea in Europe vv.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>6-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There was no plan or schedule; there was only the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we see that living Christ is the proper way to preach the gospel, we will not use any gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we are faithful to live Christ, those we know will gradually turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When gimmicks come into our gospel preaching, the result is different opinions, concepts, and eventually disputation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no positive result.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to drop the gimmicks and come back to God s way of life by living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The proper way for the churches to spread is also a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After a church grows normally for a few years, a small group of saints may spontaneously move to a nearby city and raise up a church there.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who know the truth and have the necessary measure of life will spontaneously take the lead in the new church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be equipped for this purpose, some of the young brothers should spend more time in the Word and learn the truths while they are growing and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The churches can continue to spread in this way year after year, growing and spreading to nearby cities.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Spreading in this way is spontaneous and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Eventually, there will be several local churches in an area, all living Christ, loving and helping one another, and fellowshipping all the time, yet without human control, hierarchy, organization, or maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What a wonderful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The churches should never be controlled like the branches of a corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To organizationally transfer saints to different localities is altogether against the truth and against the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The church is an organism, which cannot be rearranged like an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not need to try to maneuver saints to unify the churches or make every church the same.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should accept all the churches as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The local churches may be likened to families.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Unlike the branch offices of some corporations, every family is different.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The members of one family may be highly intelligent; the members of another family may not be as intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Nevertheless, both are genuine families.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What is important in a family, as in a local church, is not outward qualifications or gifts but love, life, and harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Transferring members between two different families to try to balance the situation will only damage both families.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The local churches should be left to grow without human interference.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the Lord s recovery there is no unification, competition, or rivalry, but only harmony, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we see this principle, we will drop our concepts and care only for Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Any migration should be based on the Lord s leading, not on human planning or activity.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We only need to live Christ, fellowship with Him, and follow His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then we will be like our father Abraham, who went out, not knowing where he was going Heb 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He simply followed the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Today we should be the same, having no plan, schedule, expectation, or outward goal.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Living Christ in a peaceful way in our daily life is our living testimony of the Lord Jesus and is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If all the saints practice this, the churches will spontaneously have the proper increase and then spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This way is full of life, harmony, and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We are nonsectarian, general, inclusive, and open to fellowship with all genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, we should not have the intention to gain Christians from other groups.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Instead, we should live Christ and pray daily for the Lord to lead us to those who need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>As we share with those whom the Lord brings to us, some will turn to the Lord and be brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When we contact other Christians, according to the Lord s leading within, we should simply fellowship with them, ministering Christ to them and receiving their Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Other Christians should have a clear impression that we are not sectarian or for building up our own work; they should sense only that we live Christ and love all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Whether they would turn the way of the Lord s recovery is altogether in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We need to drop our concepts, activities, aggressiveness, and passivity and simply live Christ, pray, and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Wherever we are, we should come together as the church, the local expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Wherever we go, we should meet with the saints in that place as the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Christ is everything in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There are no organizations, ways, gimmicks, or activities.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We must keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We also need to spend time in the Word, learn the truth, and teach, edify, and shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is the proper way.</S>
