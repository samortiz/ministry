<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS RIGHTEOUSNESS, HOLINESS, AND GLORY</h2><p>The tabernacle consisted of three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In the outer court Christ is seen as righteousness for us to enjoy. We have to put on Christ as our righteousness. In the Holy Place Christ is seen as holiness, and in the Holy of Holies there is Christ as the glory. The content of the Holy Place is holiness, and the content of the Holy of Holies is glory. Righteousness, holiness, and glory are Christ in different aspects. This shows us that Christ is the content of the church life in three aspects to be manifested in the church life. Ultimately, He is the effulgence of God’s glory (Heb. 1:3) to be expressed in and through the church. The church as the reality of the tabernacle is built to show forth, manifest, and express Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory. If we have a vision of this, our church life will be revolutionized.<h2 class=head2>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Righteousness</h2><p>Now we need to consider how people can enjoy and express Christ as their righteousness. A person approaching the tabernacle from afar would first see the white fine linen hangings of the outer court. There is something white, pure, and clean separating the outer court of the dwelling place of God from worldly things. The white linen typifies, expresses, shows forth, declares, and proclaims that Christ is our righteousness. We put on Christ as our righteousness before God and man. In ourselves we have nothing to cover or qualify us so that we can stand before God and man. Christ as our righteousness covers and qualifies us.<p>In order to enjoy Christ as our righteousness, we have to pass through the altar and the laver. The altar signifies the cross. We can prove this by Hebrews 13:10 which says, “We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.” The Old Testament priests had no right to enjoy the offerings on this altar which we have. We have an altar, and this altar is the cross. On the cross Christ accomplished an all-inclusive death. That means that on the cross Christ carried out an all-inclusive judgment. Everything negative has been judged on the cross. If we want to enjoy Christ as our righteousness and participate in the church life, we have to realize that whatever we have, whatever we are, and whatever we can do have all been judged on the cross. By judgment we are redeemed. By redemption we are justified. This is the experience of the cross.<p>Based on the cross, the Holy Spirit comes into us to regenerate us. Our regeneration is the beginning of the cleansing, washing, work of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5). Regeneration is a part of the significance of the washing of the laver. The laver washes and cleanses. The altar was covered with brass (Exo. 27:1-2), and the laver was made entirely of brass (30:18), typifying God’s judgment. The laver was made with a particular kind of brass. It was made from the brass mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the tent of meeting (38:8). In ancient times they had brass mirrors, not glass mirrors. The laver exposed the priests in the way that a mirror does to show us what we are. Before the laver cleansed and washed the priests, it told them what they were, giving them a real picture of themselves. A father may tell his child that he is dirty, but the child may not believe him. But when the father brings his child to the mirror, the child can see for himself how dirty he is. By the mirror the child is convinced that he is dirty. Then he will go to the sink to wash himself. In the same way, the laver first exposed the priests. Then it cleansed them. This signifies the working of the Holy Spirit.
