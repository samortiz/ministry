   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. As the Desolator</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Setting up Abominations in the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Daniel 9:27 also says, And for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus referred to this when He said, Ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place Matt 24:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Antichrist will bring in both abominations or idols, and desolation or destruction, demolishing both the temple and the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the proper understanding of Daniel 9:25-27.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have this understanding, we shall see how Antichrist will deal with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we come to Revelation chapter seventeen, we shall see that Antichrist will destroy Catholicism in addition to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both Judaism and Catholicism have become abominable in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although some of us were formerly in one or the other, we praise the Lord that we are no longer in these isms.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For centuries, these two isms have been abominable in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:9 and 3:9 the Lord Jesus called the Jewish synagogues the synagogue of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus revealed to the apostle John that Catholicism is the great prostitute 17:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may argue, How can you call the Jewish synagogues the synagogue of Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a synagogue the Jews worship God and study the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I was not the one who said that the synagogue is the synagogue of Satan this was the word of the Lord Jesus to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was no longer God but Satan who was in the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others, defending Catholicism, may say, Doesn t the Catholic Church preach Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But Catholicism preaches Christ as the son of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The worship of Mary comes from paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Mary in Catholicism, who is called the mother of God, is another form of the goddess, Venus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christmas is also demonic, for December 25, the date of a pagan festival in honor of the birth of the sun, is said to be the birthday of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What blasphemy!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although everything in Catholicism has a Christian appearance, its source is Babylonianism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, in God s eyes the Catholic Church is the great prostitute who enriches herself by committing spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the Catholic Church is called the great prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both Judaism and Catholicism are Satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Under Satan s instigation, Antichrist will destroy Judaism and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He will do this destroying work without realizing that he is doing it for God and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Over all this, God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Antichrist will do all these things in the process of exalting himself above every kind of god, abolishing every religion, and making himself the sole object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>E. Destroyed by God s Wrath</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, Antichrist will be destroyed by God s wrath Dan 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This destruction will be carried out by Christ at the war of Armageddon, when Christ will utterly defeat Antichrist 19:17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE KING IN DANIEL 11</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Antichrist is also the king in Daniel 11:36-45.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have already pointed out the two kings in Daniel 11, the king of the south and the king of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Daniel 11 the south refers to Egypt and the north to Syria.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At times, Egypt and Syria war against each other.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The king of Syria, the northern king, has much to do with the coming Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A. Typified by Antiochus Epiphanes</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The king in 11:36-45 is typified by Antiochus Epiphanes in Daniel 11:21-35 175-164 B.C. . Antiochus damaged the temple and polluted the sanctuary by putting a swine in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the Maccabees stood up to fight against him, as recorded in the two books of the Maccabees in the Apocrypha.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Antiochus opposed the holy covenant God had made with His people Dan 11:28, 30 and took away the continual sacrifice Dan 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, Antiochus placed the abomination idol that maketh desolate in the temple Dan 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we have seen, Antichrist will do the same.</S>
