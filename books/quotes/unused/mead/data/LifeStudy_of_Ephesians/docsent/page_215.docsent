   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:22 we see that the church is God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE WARRIOR</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Finally, in chapter six we see that the church is a warrior to defeat God s enemy, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to fight the spiritual warfare, we need both the power of the Lord and also the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his subtlety, Satan will allow Christians to do things that are scriptural and spiritual, as long as they do not have the Body or the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most Christians do not even realize that the church is the new man, a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may speak a little regarding the church as the Bride of Christ or as God s family, but they have no concept that the church is God s present kingdom or God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WHY WE ARE HERE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you find these seven aspects of the church in Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the church, Christianity has missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We in the Lord s recovery are not here for soul-winning, for Bible study, or for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are here for the expression of the Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are also here to be the new man and the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At present, Christ is preparing us to be His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day the wedding will come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That will be the fulfillment of Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we are preparing for that day, we are the church in the aspects of the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord that we are His family!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we came into the church life, we had the sense that we had come home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the church is God s kingdom, for here we are under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, as God s warrior we are fighting against His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are here for the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>EXPRESSING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the Body, the church needs life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without life, our physical body would become a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same is true of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some opposers argue that the Body is just a symbol, a figure, not a divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is utterly wrong to say that the Body of Christ is merely a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our body is a symbol and a figure, but the Body of Christ is a reality, for our body symbolizes Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To say that the Body of Christ is merely a symbol indicates a lack of a proper understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who hold this view do not see that the church is actually the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely Christ is real.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can such a real One be expressed through a symbolic Body?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How ridiculous!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order for Christ to be expressed, He must have a real and living Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not express Christ by endeavoring to correct or improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through such efforts we can express only our own character.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would express Christ, we need the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need Christ as the living Spirit to live Himself out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not outward correction or improvement; it is the experience of Christ as our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit living within us and lived out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This makes us His Body for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we express as the Body of Christ is not our character, but Christ Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the new man, the church needs not only life, but also Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A tree has only life, not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But a man must have a person as well as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church not only possesses Christ as life, but also holds Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, today the Lord Jesus is not only the life of the church, but also the person of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to have the church life, we all must take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if we each hold to our own person, we shall be through with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Colossians 3:10 and 11 reveal that in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that in the new man there is just one person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no room for Chinese, Japanese, American, British, German, or any other nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This should not be a mere doctrine, but should be our practical experience in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a part of the new man, we all have Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to pray, Lord, make this real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot be satisfied with knowledge or with the doctrine that the church is the new man with Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We want this to be experienced in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>O Lord, help us to take You as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do this, the church will be truly one, and the enemy will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whoever comes into the meetings of the church will see a number of people who take Christ as their person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How marvelous!</S>
