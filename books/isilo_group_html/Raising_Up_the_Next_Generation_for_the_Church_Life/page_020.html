<p>Genesis 17:12-13 says, &ldquo;Every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed. He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised; thus My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God called Abraham and made a covenant with him, saying, &ldquo;I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you&rdquo; (v. 7). The sign of the covenant between God and Abraham was circumcision. All who were circumcised belonged to God, and all who were not circumcised were not of God. God also told Abraham that his whole household needed to be circumcised, including those who were born in his house and those who were bought with his money. Therefore, the promise of circumcision was not given to Abraham alone but to his whole household. Circumcision takes the household as a unit. God&rsquo;s promise came to Abraham&rsquo;s house, not to him alone.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Passover Lamb for Each Household</h2>
<p>Exodus 12:3-7 says, &ldquo;Speak to all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month each man shall take a lamb according to his fathers&rsquo; house, a lamb for a household...And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passover lamb was clearly given to a household, not to an individual. Again we see the importance of a household before God. The passover lamb had to do with a household; it was not an individual matter. A lamb was not prepared for each person, but for each household. The blood struck on the doorposts and the lintel was to protect the whole household. The angel of destruction would pass over a whole household.</p>
<p>It is marvelous to see that the salvation prepared by the Lord Jesus Christ is not for an individual alone but for the whole household, just like the passover lamb. If one man eats the lamb, it means that only he is being saved. But if the whole household eats the lamb, it means that the whole household is being saved. Salvation is for the whole household. The whole household eats the lamb, and similarly the whole household strikes the blood. The whole household enjoys these things together. May God open our eyes to see that salvation is a matter of the whole household, not individuals. (<em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> vol. 2, pp. 303-308)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>In Exodus 12, the passover lamb was eaten according to households. If a household was too small for the lamb, they were to share their lamb with a neighboring house (vv. 3-4). Furthermore, the blood of the passover lamb was put on the doorposts and the lintel of the house in which they were instead of upon any individual. To take the Passover as an individual is contrary to God&rsquo;s economy. Jesus Christ, as the Passover lamb, is not only for individuals; He is for a whole house. If we do not take care of the household as the unit of God&rsquo;s salvation, we are violating the principle of God&rsquo;s economy. (<em>Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way,</em> p. 71)</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Priesthood Being for the Household</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s promise of the priesthood was also for a whole house. It was not for one or two individuals. Numbers 18:1 says, &ldquo;Then Jehovah said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father&rsquo;s household with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a perpetual statute; everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.&rdquo; God gave all the sacrifices and offerings to the house of Aaron. The sacrifices were for the house of Aaron, not for Aaron alone. This is because God accepts the house as a whole. Please remember that the priesthood was for Aaron&rsquo;s house, not for Aaron alone. The priesthood took the household as a unit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Household Salvation</h2>
<p>Joshua 2:19 says, &ldquo;Anyone who goes forth from the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be upon his own head, and we will be innocent. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood will be upon our heads if a hand should come upon him.&rdquo; Joshua 6:17 says, &ldquo;And the city shall be devoted to Jehovah for destruction, it and all that is in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in her house, because she hid the messengers we sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we see Rahab the harlot and her household being saved. What did she do? She received the spies. When she received the spies, God gave her a sign. She was to tie a line of scarlet thread in the window. All who were in the house that had the scarlet thread were spared, while the rest of the inhabitants of Jericho were killed. The scarlet thread signifies salvation. The scarlet-thread salvation saved Rahab&rsquo;s household; it did not save just her.</p>
<p>We need to be very clear about the scope of salvation. Chapter 2 of Joshua gives the promise, and chapter 6 gives the actual execution. Both the promise in chapter 2 and the execution in chapter 6 show us that Rahab&rsquo;s whole household was saved. All who were in the house that had the scarlet thread were saved. God&rsquo;s salvation is for the whole household, not for individuals.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
