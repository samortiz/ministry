<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Economical Trinity</H2><P>Essentially, God is one, but economically He is three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). In God's plan, God's administrative arrangement, God's economy, the Father takes the first step, the Son takes the second step, and the Spirit takes the third step. The Father purposed (Eph. 1:4-6), the Son accomplished (vv. 7-12), and the Spirit applies what the Son accomplished according to the Father's purpose (vv. 13-14). This is a successive procedure or a succession in God's economy to carry out His eternal purpose. Whereas the essential Trinity refers to the essence of the Triune God for His existence, the economical Trinity refers to His plan for His move. There is the need of the existence of the Divine Trinity, and there is also the need of the plan of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>The Father accomplished the first step of His plan, His economy, by working to choose and predestinate us, but He did this in Christ the Son (Eph. 1:4-5) and with the Spirit. After this plan was made, the Son came to accomplish this plan, but He did this with the Father (John 8:29; 16:32) and by the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20; 12:28). Now that the Son has accomplished all that the Father has planned, the Spirit comes in the third step to apply all that He accomplished, but He does this as the Son and with the Father (John 14:26; 15:26; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). In this way, while the divine economy of the Divine Trinity is being carried out, the divine existence of the Divine Trinity, His eternal coexistence and coinherence, remains intact and is not jeopardized.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Three of the Divine Trinity<br>Being Distinct but Not Separate</H2><P>Among the three of the Divine Trinity, there is distinction but no separation. The Father is distinct from the Son, the Son is distinct from the Spirit, and the Spirit is distinct from the Son and the Father. But we cannot say that They are separate, because They coinhere, that is, They live within one another. In Their coexistence the three of the Godhead are distinct, but Their coinherence makes them one. They coexist in Their coinherence, so They are distinct but not separate.</P><P>The Son never did anything apart from the Father (John 5:19). He came in the Father's name (v. 43) and with the Father (8:29; 16:32). He is in the Father and the Father is in Him (14:10-11). Furthermore, He was begotten of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20) and did everything by the Spirit (Luke 4:1, 18a; Matt. 12:28).</P><P>The Holy Scriptures also reveal that the Son is the Father. Isaiah 9:6 says, "A child is born to us, a son is given to us...and His name will be called...Mighty God, Eternal Father." The Lord Jesus as the child born in Bethlehem is the Mighty God, and the Lord Jesus who is the Son is also the Eternal Father.</P>
