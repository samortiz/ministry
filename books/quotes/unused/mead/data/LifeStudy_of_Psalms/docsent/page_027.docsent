   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Take Refuge in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Believe into the Son, Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 2:12b says, "Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To take refuge in the Son equals to believe into the Son, Christ John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of us probably have never considered that to believe into Christ is to take refuge in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see this with the type of Noah's ark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When all the people trusted, or believed in, that ark, they all entered into that ark, to take the ark as their refuge, protection, and hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today our Christ is our refuge, our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are hiding ourselves in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After getting into bed, I usually pray, "Lord, cover us, our building, and our yard with Your prevailing blood against all the enemy's attack."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The next morning I thank the Lord for being our security.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every time I take a trip, I ask the Lord to be my protection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I ask the Lord to cover the car which I will take to the airport and to cover the plane in which I will fly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even, of course, I take the Lord as my refuge under God's eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are experiences of taking refuge in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Kiss the Son Love Christ, the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 2:12a says that we need to kiss the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament tells us that we need faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:14, "And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's grace visited Paul and superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day he received mercy and grace from the Lord, not only to believe in Him but also to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been given faith to believe into Christ, taking Him as our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, we have been given God's love to love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Gospel of John, we are taught that we need to believe into Christ, the Son 1:12 , and to love Him 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the last chapter of John, chapter twenty-one, the very Christ who is our refuge came back to Peter to restore Peter's love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter failed utterly in denying the Lord three times 18:17, 25, 27 , so the Lord came back to ask him three times "Do you love Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I think that this threefold asking reminded Peter of his being defeated three times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why Peter responded by saying, "Lord, You know."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter said, "Lord, You know that I love You" 21:15b, 16b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A young believer may be strong to boldly tell the Lord that he loves Him and will never deny Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when he is defeated, his natural confidence in his love toward the Lord will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he will learn to follow the Lord and to love the Lord without any confidence in his natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To believe in the Lord is to receive Him; to love the Lord is to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Gospel of John presents these as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord is within us to be our faith and to be our love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To love Him, according to Psalm 2:12a, is to kiss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not uplift and treasure the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, we should kiss Christ, love Christ, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I read a portion of John Nelson Darby's writings which inspired me to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day when he was over eighty years old, he was traveling and he stayed overnight in a hotel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before going to sleep, he said to the Lord, "Lord Jesus, I still love You."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That inspired me to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After many years, he could still speak such a word to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to ask the Lord to keep us loving Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>D. Concerning the Accomplishment</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>of the Economy of God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Psalm 2 is concerning the accomplishment of the economy of God, whereas Psalm 1 is concerning the personal benefit of the saints vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The human concept of Psalm 1 is that the man who delights in the law of God prospers in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But according to the New Testament revelation, the law is over and Christ is here Rom 10:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is the centrality and universality of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The entire book of Psalms takes these two lines: the law and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, by the end of the Psalms, the law is over, and we see Christ with His complement, which is His Body, His church, the house and the kingdom of God in God's economy to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, we have to see that Psalms 1 and 2 show us a comparison of the human concept in exalting the law with its keeper as the one blessed by God in man's interest and the divine revelation in proclaiming Christ as the One anointed of God in God's economy.</S>
