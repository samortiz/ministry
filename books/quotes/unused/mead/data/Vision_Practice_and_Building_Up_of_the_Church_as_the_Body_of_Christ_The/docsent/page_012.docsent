   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Every Defeat Being a Preparation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Universal Victory</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible clearly and thoroughly reveals that what God has been doing in the past generations, still is doing now, and will be doing in the future is to fully accomplish His sonship in us and to subdue the enemy, to cast out the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This will be done through the church and by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At present, as regards the sonship, we are under a process, and as regards the subduing of the enemy, we are in a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not only in a process but also in a battle, fighting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we are defeated; there is no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In fighting sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, do not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes a defeat is for the purpose of a future victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is why I said that in the early days when I saw someone defeated, I was sorry, but today when I see someone defeated, I say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the preparation for a further victory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually we will not be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Victory will be ours, not the enemy s. I have this assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you think that eventually Satan will be victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No, we who are in Christ will be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you believe in defeat, or do you believe in victory?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the past years many dear ones have come to me to argue, Brother Lee, we never see you feeling sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You always look happy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is too extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told these ones, If you argue for feeling sorrowful, you eventually will lose the case.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do not lose it today, you will lose it tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not lose it in this generation, you will lose in the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not lose it in this age, I am sure you will lose it in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Revelation 21 comes, you will lose the case for feeling sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no need for us to be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should always be happy and praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even a defeat is a preparation for a further victory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let the enemy try to defeat us; eventually he will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What kind of Bible do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to say, I have a Bible of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a book of victory, not a book of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How many books of the Bible do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you have only sixty-five books, without Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may show me what is mentioned in 2 Timothy 4 regarding the decline of the church, but I would say, Look at Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Again you may show me the poor condition of the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, but there are not only three chapters in Revelation; there are twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Go on from chapter 3 until you get to chapter 21.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time the universal Hallelujah will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The whole universe will cry, Hallelujah, victory!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Within this Bible are the Old and the New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A testament is something that is accomplished and given to us as a will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We simply accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our victory is an item of the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the eyes of the Lord, Satan has been defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a matter of fact; it is a settled matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have this foresight and insight, then day by day we will sing Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With the church there is no difference between a defeat and a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even a defeat is for a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must tell Satan, Satan, even your victory is a preparation for our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can never be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually you will be the one who is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not care how much you attack and how much you damage.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus said in John 2:19, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more you destroy, the more the Lord will build up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your destroying is just a preparation for His building up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need the vision of how much the Lord will use the church to defeat His enemy and to subdue and recover the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day this will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>HEADING UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The third item of God s purpose for the church is to head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the greatest item.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first item of God s purpose is the sonship, for the church positively.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The second item, the subduing of the enemy, is for the enemy negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The third item, to head up all things in Christ, is for all the creation universally.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church must have the sonship, Satan must be subdued and cast out, and the whole creation must be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When all creation is headed up, it will be delivered from vanity and from the slavery of corruption, and it will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These three main items one for the church, one for the enemy, and one for the whole creation are truly great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today All Creation Being under Satan s Damage</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The phrase to head up all things in Christ is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the things in God s creation were right, but the enemy of God came in and injected himself into the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then death, darkness, and confusion came in, and the whole of creation was brought into vanity under the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, even up to this time the whole creation is groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the situation under Satan s damage in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That even the little mosquitoes bite us illustrates the damage in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There will be no need for pest control in the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today, however, the whole universe is damaged by Satan, because he brought in death, darkness, and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God s Recovery of His Creation</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Being by Life and Light</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God s way to recover His creation is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Satan injected himself into creation, bringing in death, darkness, and confusion, but now God has imparted Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Since God has come in, life follows, and light follows life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Under the light there is the proper regulation, which brings in harmony and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>First there was Satan, death, darkness, and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now we have Christ, life, light, and harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How can the whole creation be delivered out of vanity and corruption?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is only by God being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When we have God in Christ as life to us, life becomes the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Eventually the entire environment, the whole universe, will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:11, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Under the control of this light, the whole universe, the whole of creation, will be in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The New Jerusalem Being</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>a City of Life and Light,</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>by Whose Light All the Nations Will Walk</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have the full picture of this situation in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>At the top of the New Jerusalem, Christ is the Head with God in Him as the very content.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>From Him flows the river of life with the tree of life to supply all His sons, and the redeemed ones as the sons of God are filled with life 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The whole city shines out this life as light, and the nations, representing the whole universe, walk in the light of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Because Christ is at the top of the city as the Head, all things are headed up in Christ through the Body, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This picture is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At that time the entire universe will be in a good harmony, and there will be no more death, thus no more darkness and no more confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Within, the city is full of life, and without, it is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The whole environment surrounding the city will be under the regulation of this light.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then the whole universe will be headed up in Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This will be the full manifestation of Christ being Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Have you seen this picture?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This picture is often before me.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Christ is at the top of the New Jerusalem as the Head, and from Him flows the bountiful life to supply us all.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We are filled with this life, and spontaneously we shine out this life as light to the whole environment.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Then all the surrounding nations, representing the entire universe, walk in this light and are controlled under this light.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Thus, they will have the real harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All things will be headed up in Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the consummation of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>At this time the sonship will be fully fulfilled, the enemy will be cast out, and all things will be headed up in Christ through the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Even today this can be realized among us to some degree.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When we know how to enjoy the sonship, how to defeat the enemy, and how to be filled with Christ under His headship, light shines out of us, and others are under the enlightening of this light.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is a foretaste and miniature of the coming consummation.</S>
