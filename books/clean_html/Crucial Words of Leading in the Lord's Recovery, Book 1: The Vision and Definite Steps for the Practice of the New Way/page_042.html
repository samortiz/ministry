<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: We have group meetings in our homes, but sometimes we also meet where we work in order to make it more convenient to bring people to the Lord and to edify the new ones. But some of our colleagues live in places that belong to different halls. How should we take care of the statistics and to which hall should we report the number of our small group?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is better not to know, because once we know, there will be no increase. Revelation 3 says that the church in Laodicea thinks that she is wealthy yet does not realize that she is poor. This is to say that when we think we know, we are poor. Only when we do not know can we be wealthy. And only when we are wealthy can we multiply home after home and have home meetings from house to house. In the past we were too clear in our distinctions, and we eventually became deadened. Even though now we may seem unclear, as long as we are living, everything is fine; we should not worry too much. As long as there are the statistics in heaven, that is fine. We do not need to count the number on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE REAL WAY TO WORK&mdash;<br />
WORKING WITHOUT PREACHING</h2>
<p>Home meetings have many advantages. What the big meetings can do, the home meetings can do also. For instance, in a home meeting last Saturday two new ones were baptized in the bathtub. Big meetings bind people, and preaching kills people. But the home meetings stir up the organic function of the saints and encourage them to fulfill their function. In a recent co-workers&rsquo; meeting, I told the co-workers that to learn the real way to work is to learn to work without preaching. The Lord Jesus was the best example. He did not have a set style of speaking. Sometimes He spoke two or three sentences, and at other times He gave a long discourse. Moreover, He did not have a set place or a set time to speak. He could speak anywhere and at any time. This is what we co-workers should learn. We must go against the dead rules and regulations of our past.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES<br />
AND ADVANCING ACCORDING TO<br />
TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES</h2>
<p>On the other hand, I strongly advise the elders from all the churches to receive this new leading and practice. We may have taken care of the church in our locality for thirty years, but the church has remained the same. It would be best to find someone who is younger who can be a helper. He might not be as experienced as we are, but this does not mean that his ability to do things is inferior to ours. We should give him an opportunity to learn to serve.</p>
<p>We have always been faithful to the teaching of the Bible and have not been willing to take a way that is inconsistent with the Scriptures. Therefore, regarding some important matters, we must consider again and again what the Bible reveals to us. Concerning the appointment and qualification of co-workers and elders, we can view this from two angles. On the one hand, we should follow the Scriptures. On the other hand, based on our long-term history, we know that some of our co-workers have been harmed because there has been no evaluation of their service. Today in various big companies and government organizations there are examinations with grades. Even diplomatic officials must take examinations. We are human beings. Even though we have been saved, we cannot deny that our nature is still fallen. We may have much spiritual learning, but as long as we have not been raptured, our fallen nature is still in us. I absolutely believe that if we had systematically evaluated the co-workers in Taiwan over the past thirty years, the co-workers would have been more fruitful than they are today.</p>
<p>The same applies to the elders. I have considered this matter for many years. In the Bible we cannot find any length of time for the service of an elder. According to our understanding, it seems as if an elder should serve his whole life, like a justice on the Supreme Court. If an elder is constantly learning and making progress and is truly an elder among the saints, this is all right. But if one has been an elder for twenty or thirty years, and the church under his management is only mediocre, this proves that the time has come for him to voluntarily yield his position to someone who is younger but more qualified and experienced. If we wait for the co-workers to address the issue, it will be embarrassing and unpleasant for everyone. I hope the elders will consider their situation to discern those who have been manifested by the Holy Spirit and let them take the lead. In this way the churches can have a new beginning and a new hope.</p>
<p>In reality, our system must be updated. We are too old. We are still adhering to the way we learned thirty years ago. Our thinking has not kept abreast of the times, our equipment is outdated, and our plans and methods are old. Today we cannot remain old-fashioned; we need to learn aggressively. If our co-workers are not willing to learn new ways, once the system is changed or once they leave Taiwan, they will be unemployed, having nothing to do, because they will not know how to do anything. However, some co-workers may feel that the old way is still better and that it is not good to change the system and have a new beginning. I would ask them, &ldquo;If your way is good, where is the increase?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>May the Lord forgive me and may all of you bear with me as I boast a little. Twenty-three years ago I went to the United States empty-handed. I did not have anything&mdash;no helper and no support. I labored alone and relied entirely on the Lord&rsquo;s provision. When I first began my work in America, there was no meeting hall. I started my work in a Chinese brother&rsquo;s house, which was in a neighborhood where there were predominantly black people. When I departed from Taiwan, I left the co-workers with rich assets of meeting halls in all the main cities and tens of thousands of brothers and sisters. In the past fifteen years, because of the proper leadership of the government in Taiwan, there has been a rapid economic development in Taiwan, and the offerings of the saints have been strong. Yet we have not made any progress in our work. This is all because of an improper method.</p>
<p>I do not mean to put the blame on anyone, but I want us all to be awakened to see that our old ways are not right, and our system is also not right. We need to have an overall review and a complete change. We must begin everything anew. We are elders of the biggest church on earth, having twenty-one halls in our hands. We must realize that the only solution to our problem is to change the system. Under the present shining, we need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I too old? Is my way too stale? Am I still qualified to take the lead?&rdquo; We need to keep asking ourselves these questions. Today we are all living before the Lord and are responsible to Him. One day we will need to give an account to Him. We cannot wander about and live in a carefree way. Twenty years are a long time, but they have gone by fast. In the past twenty years we neither increased nor decreased in number. We should be awakened to discard the old things and adopt new things. If we are willing to forget the things which are behind and stretch forward to the things which are before, the churches under our leading will have the beautiful prospect of an increase.</p>
