   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us come back to the illustration of the sinfulness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This must be a fresh vision in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If it is fresh within us, we will be a minister of the word when we release it sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If it is not fresh within us, we can speak about the sinfulness of sin on the platform, but others will receive only stale manna; it may be a day old, a year old, or even ten years old.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will not be serving as ministers of the word in that case, and our word will amount to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When some brothers give a gospel message, others can see that they have the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When others preach, others can see that they do not have the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person has it, he has it; if he does not have it, he does not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same principle can be applied to higher and deeper revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation is kept alive in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be a minister of the word, our word has to be nurtured in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have the memory of the Holy Spirit, this memory will become operative as we speak and convey the inner word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The strange thing is that when we see something in the spirit, we may forget about it the very first time we try to use it to minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot speak what we want to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is understandable that we might lose the acute sense of sin which we felt ten or fifteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But while we are speaking on the platform, we often forget what we saw the night before.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our outward memory is useless in retaining the revelation of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot depend on our outward memory to capture the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation can only be retained in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose a person realizes the great difference between pressing upon the Lord and touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He sees the great difference between physically and spiritually touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he sees it, he is very clear and very happy about what he has seen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After two or three days, when he visits a sick brother, he tries to tell him the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet he finds that he is going around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more he speaks, the colder and emptier his words become; his endeavor is completely futile.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With sweat upon his brow, he tries as hard as he can to remember what he once saw, but to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only reason for his failure is that his revelation has not been nurtured in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the words of revelation were nurtured in the memory of the Holy Spirit, he would have no trouble using them in his ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we need the revelation, the thoughts, the inner words, and the outer words, and we also need the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without the memory of the Holy Spirit, the inner words and the outer words do not function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No one can be a minister of the word by his own natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not matter what kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we trust in our natural strength, we are completely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only a foolish person boasts about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What do we have to boast of if we cannot even remember what we saw yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We rack our brains to recall what we saw yesterday, and we still cannot remember a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No matter how hard we try, our memory still fails us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to support and supply the outer word with the word of revelation, we have to maintain the word of revelation within the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only then will the words we speak be what the Lord wants us to speak, and only then will they be spiritual, not physical.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless the words of revelation which we have received are preserved in the memory of the Holy Spirit, we will find our spirit sagging as soon as we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord works in us, it is easy for us to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when the Lord does not work in us, nothing is harder than assuming the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man remains loose and forgetful, and if he is undisciplined in his thoughts and words, he is useless in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are strict requirements for the ministry of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has to work on us very much before He can use us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we allow ourselves to relax a little, we may still be able to do other things, but we will not be able to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to ask the Lord for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to ask Him to grant us the memory of the Holy Spirit so that we can remember the words we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Revelation is within the word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have the memory of the Holy Spirit within us, we will remember the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will remember not only the word of revelation but the revelation of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we supply the outer words with this word of revelation, we will know what we are talking about as soon as we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While we speak, we will see, and spontaneously we will become ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If while we are speaking, we do not see the inward things, we panic.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We become confused and do not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers, we have to acknowledge the futility of a clever mind in this endeavor.</S>
