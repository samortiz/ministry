   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I am happy in my heart because I can preach the "heresy" of God's Word and I can oppose the "truth" in man's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we have to be clear before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot be under any other authority but that of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know no other authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not know what theology is; I do not know what man's word is; I do not know what the tradition of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I only know what the Bible says, and only what it says counts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must subject ourselves to it only.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot change God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word of God tells us the destiny of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It tells us what we will experience in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must pay attention to these issues because sooner or later we will face them again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we pay attention to them we will be careful how we live on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second thing that we must realize is that only those who understand the truth can oppose heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One heresy cannot oppose another heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But all heresies are not pure heresy; they are the truth plus a little error.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Heresy is to add wrong things to right things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Add a little of man's thought to God's thought, and you will have heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because Catholicism does not fully know the truth in the Bible, it preaches the doctrine of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do not know the truth that we have released in the last few meetings, you will not be able to tell whether the doctrine of purgatory is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now that you have heard these messages, you will realize that the doctrine of purgatory is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can say that it is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible we see that God's discipline of the Christians happens in the millennium, but Catholics say that there is a purging going on today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They say that if a Christian does not live up to standard on earth today, he will not be able to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, he must be purged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, they say that as soon as a Christian dies, he begins to be purged and is purged until the job is done.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there is absolutely no such teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible never says that as soon as a Christian dies, he will be purged in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible shows us that there will be the discipline in the kingdom in the future, but there is no purging in Hades today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, Catholics make another grave mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They think that if they secure for themselves indulgences while they are alive or if the priests pray for them after they die, they will be relieved of some of the purging of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Bible never says anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible says only that he who has mercy on others will obtain mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praying by the priest will not do anything for the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible never teaches us to pray for the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Third, Catholics tell people that a man will not be saved until he has been completely purged in purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is an absolute overturning of the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible shows us that there is no other name in heaven or on earth besides that of the Lord Jesus whereby we must be saved Acts 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only He can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apart from the Lord Jesus, there is no salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Discipline and chastisement are not for salvation but for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The matter of our salvation is settled long before God disciplines us, but there are still things in us that do not match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are still imperfections and areas that are not up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, there is the discipline in this age and the discipline in the coming kingdom.</S>
