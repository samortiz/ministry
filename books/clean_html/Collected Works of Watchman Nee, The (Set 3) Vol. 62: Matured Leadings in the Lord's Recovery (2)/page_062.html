<h2 class="head2">Gospel Songs</h2><p>In congregational preaching, we need gospel songs. These gospel songs should be one-fourth of the content of a gospel meeting. I am an outsider as far as music is concerned, but I can make a few comments because I have learned some lessons these years in preaching the gospel.</p><p>The first thing to remember in singing gospel songs is to not emphasize the music too much. If we emphasize the music too much, we may lose the gospel spirit. The tune and the rhythm must be right, but the main emphasis should be the spirit. When we sing in private, we can take care of the music. But in leading others to sing in a gospel meeting, we must have spiritual inspiration. Music is the inspiration of the soul; it can only touch man's soul. If we want to touch man's spirit, we must have spiritual inspiration. In order to have spiritual inspiration, we must fellowship with the Lord and pray. This is the only way to have spiritual power. Suppose we are singing a song about sin. As we sing it, we must have a feeling for sin. Men's hearts must be pricked. The same can be said about songs on God's love. Others must genuinely touch God's love and be moved by it. Some people are fifty percent saved after they sing a song. If we sing properly, we can touch sinners easily. Another thing we should remember is that we should not try to put too much expression on our face when we sing. Everything should come spontaneously from the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Things to Consider with Children's Meetings</h2><p>Concerning children's meetings during the gospel meetings (i.e., child care), we have to pay attention to a few points. First, the content of the children's meeting must never be the same as the content of the gospel message. For example, the gospel message may be on vanity or the futility of work in salvation. We cannot speak this to the children, because such topics are unsuitable for their age.</p><p>We should tell the children Bible stories. Use Bible stories to show them the proper standard of human life. But we have to beware of two things. First, there is the possibility of premature spiritual knowledge. Second, we can give away biblical truths too cheaply. Some teachers are too spiritual. They tell children teachings that are too high and too spiritual. For example, they may teach the children to pray, "Help us, Lord, to deal with our flesh. May Your cross work on us." This gives the children premature spiritual knowledge. It will not help them. Other teachers treat spiritual things too lightly in an attempt to make the children understand. Their speaking does not do justice to the spiritual weight of their subject. This is also wrong. This gives away the truth too cheaply. We have to use the stories in the Bible to teach the children some lessons they can apply in their daily life. We have to teach them to live a normal human life. Of course, we cannot tell too many Bible stories. Otherwise, they will only go home with a bag of stories. Before children are old enough, we should never give them things that are too high or too spiritual for them.</p><p>The teachers of the children's meetings have to be very careful with their behavior and attitude. Their attire should be neat and simple. They should not wear flashy clothing, hair styles, or make-up. Teachers sometimes set improper examples for children, and this damages the children for their entire life. Frivolous words and jokes and improper conduct and gestures should be avoided. The teaching material is not that important by comparison. Teaching by example is more important than teaching by word of mouth. The brothers and sisters who act as teachers should be very careful and sober in their character and conduct.</p><p>The young ones should remember these words. They should do more and learn more. The young people should learn to work, but they should not overdo anything. They should learn to work in the proper amount. If they become too busy they will neglect the proper spiritual education.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Preach the Gospel<br />in All Kinds of Ways</h2><p>The above things require much training and practice. In preaching the gospel, we have to touch man's spirit. We have to use suitable words and deal with people in a suitable manner. We can ask some people to kneel down to pray, but we should allow others to sit down and pray. We should not do anything by force. With some people, we can encourage them to kneel down, and when they kneel down, they are saved. But others may react exactly the opposite. We must touch man's spirit, and we must touch the spirit that is present at the moment. Some people may tell us that they are ready to leave. But if we talk to them a little more and ask them to pray, they will be saved. In all these matters we need a sensitive spirit. We have to learn more and practice more. As we practice more, we will pick up an interest for this work. I do not know anything about fishing. Often I lose my bait and the fish get away. It is not enough to know how to place the bait. One has to know the disposition of the fish. The same can be said of preaching the gospel. We can push some people a little. With others, we have to go along with them a little. If we learn more and contact people more, we will discover the law to personal evangelism.</p>
