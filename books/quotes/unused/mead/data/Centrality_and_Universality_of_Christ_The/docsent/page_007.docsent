   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Third, today's Christianity is full of gifts, full of the seeking for healings and speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How much Christ is there?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christianity is full of forms, full of teachings, and full of gifts, but has very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ nearly has no place, no ground, even in the formal church, the doctrinal church, the fundamental church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Also, in the Pentecostal church there is not much room for Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the condition of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We surely should mourn over such a situation Matt 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The United States is a Christian country but has very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not trying to teach you and give you something new.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am here to tell you that you need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What you need is not forms, doctrines, gifts, healings, and speaking in tongues, but Christ the living One, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to know Him and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to be filled with Him, to be saturated with Him, and to be mingled, blended, with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament, we have the Epistle to the Hebrews, which deals with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those Hebrew Christians had the best religion, the Jewish religion, yet they greatly neglected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They forgot about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were distracted and even separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were led away from the right track, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They paid attention to something other than Christ, something which was used by God to bring people, to conduct people, to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But their religion became a substitute for Christ, something taking the place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though it was good at one time, it eventually replaced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians shows us that the law became a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Galatians were trying to do good, to improve themselves, and to adjust themselves in order to have good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of thing crept in among the Christians to usurp the place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some Christians are good and try to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this is a deceiving by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not for good conduct; we are persons who are one hundred percent for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were made vessels not to contain good conduct but to contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are Christ-containers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians shows us the contrast between Christ and the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have said many times that 1 Corinthians shows us that it is quite possible for someone to have many gifts yet still be a babe, an infant, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Corinthian believers had all the outward, miraculous gifts, yet they were childish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is why the apostle was forced to say, "When I came to you...I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 2:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Jews are seeking signs, miracles, and supernatural things, and the Greeks are seeking wisdom and knowledge, but we, the saved ones of God, preach only Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Besides Christ, we know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the real power for signs and the real wisdom for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the enemy is still very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the enemy were to bring in something sinful, all the lovers of Christ, the seeking ones, would reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the enemy is subtle to bring in something good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is something really good, but it is not Christ Himself.</S>
