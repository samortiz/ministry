   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Receive Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 13:17 the Lord Jesus said, "If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that to practice foot-washing is to receive blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if instead of practicing foot-washing, we conceal within us our feelings concerning the defects of the brothers and sisters, there will be much accumulation of dirt to hinder our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we know the significance of foot-washing and practice it, we shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Foot-washing is a way to receive blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To Sift the False One</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Foot-washing also sifts the false one 13:18-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among Christians today there are many tares, many false ones, because spiritual foot-washing is not practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But whenever we practice this foot-washing, the false ones are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John puts together three matters: foot-washing, Judas' betrayal of the Lord, and Peter's self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that these matters are put together indicates that foot-washing sifts the false one and also exposes the real, yet self-confident, one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among those who claim to follow Christ, there are two problems related to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These problems are falsehood, signified by Judas, and self-confidence, signified by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today's society is full of falsehood and self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter was genuine, but with his genuineness there was self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The best way to keep the false ones away from the church life is to practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we practice foot-washing, the more the false ones will be sifted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because foot-washing exposes, the false ones cannot stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is possible to be a false one at a love feast, but it is not possible to be a false one when foot-washing is practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the genuine ones can receive foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The false ones cannot tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a local church practices foot-washing, no false one will be able to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Foot-washing closes the door to every false one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason today's religion is full of false ones is that there is no practice of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of foot-washing, there is politics, and politics produces false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>False ones are also produced by politeness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some may be troubled to hear that politeness produces false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you turn to your spirit, stay in the spirit, and live and walk according to the spirit, I doubt that you will be merely polite.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that you will see that the Spirit leads you only to be genuine, humble, frank, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Politeness, on the contrary, may be only beautified hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you try to be polite, what you are actually doing is beautifying your hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This can be compared to a mortician applying cosmetics to a dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In human society today, there is a certain kind of beauty, but this beauty is that of cosmetics applied to a dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Politeness may be nothing more than dead beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have seen that foot-washing exposes the false ones and does not allow them to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was at the time of foot-washing that the Lord Jesus released the word that Judas would betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of concealing the matter, the Lord released what was on His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning Judas' betrayal, the Lord Jesus was troubled in spirit: "When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in the spirit and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me" v. 21 . The Lord Jesus revealed what was troubling Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here we see the principle, set up by the Lord's example, that foot-washing sifts the false one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To Expose the Self-confident One</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have indicated that foot-washing also exposes the self-confident one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Foot-washing will expose whether we are proud or humble, whether we are self-confident or trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peter was exposed by foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although he was genuine, he was also very self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, at the time of foot-washing the Lord said to him, "Will you lay down your life for Me?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Truly, truly, I say to you, a cock shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times" v. 38 . The Lord loved Peter to the uttermost, but Peter denied the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before Peter denied Him, he was self-confident, and this self-confidence was exposed by foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am glad that in the church life we do not practice literal foot-washing as a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we do have spiritual foot-washing in order to eliminate all defects so that we may have clear fellowship with one another and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through the practice of foot-washing, everything becomes genuine, frank, pure, clean, and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No dirt is concealed, and no falsehood or self-confidence remains.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we practice foot-washing in the church life, no false one will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, the strong, self-confident ones will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone had asked Peter about his denying the Lord, he may have said, "I was full of self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Lord had a way to bring me down.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord washed my feet, and I was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But I still need your foot-washing, and I am willing to receive it."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is needed in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Apparently the record of foot-washing in John 13 is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Actually, it is crucial in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If there is no foot-washing, we cannot have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From over fifty years' experience in the church life, I realize that all the churches on earth need the practice of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to maintain clear fellowship with one another and with the Lord, we need the reality of foot-washing.</S>
