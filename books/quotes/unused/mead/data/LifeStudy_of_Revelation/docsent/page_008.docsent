   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE TWO THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UNIQUE AND ULTIMATE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In their reading of the book of Revelation not many Christians have paid their full attention to the revelation of Christ contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This term, the revelation of Jesus Christ, is found in 1:1, and Bible students have held different opinions of its interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some say that this term means that the book of Revelation is a book given by Christ as a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This interpretation, which makes the revelation of Christ very objective, is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read the whole book of Revelation, we shall see that this term indicates that Revelation is the unveiling of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a picture, a depiction, of Christ, not merely a revelation given by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must see that Christ is the center, the focus, and the predominant figure of the whole book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we must take the term the revelation of Jesus Christ in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not merely a revelation given by Christ, but a revelation which unveils Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is revealed in the prophecies, types, and clear words of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense, we do not need the New Testament, for if we read the Old Testament, paying close attention to the prophecies, types, and clear words regarding Christ, we shall have a revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through these revelations, we can visualize what kind of Christ is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, however perfect are the revelations of Christ in the Old Testament, they are not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we must come to the New Testament which fully is a revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we merely read the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles, we shall see many aspects of Christ, but we shall not see the aspects covered in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this message we must see the unique and particular aspects of Christ s revelation contained in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. CHRIST IN HIS ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the book of Revelation, Christ is revealed as the ascended One 5:3-6, 8-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the four Gospels we see Christ incarnated, living on earth, crucified, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we do not see very much concerning Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even in the Epistles we see little of Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles say something regarding Christ s ascension, in none of these books do we find a clear picture of the scene or state in the heavens after Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we would see this picture, we must come to the book of Revelation where we have a portrait of Christ in the heavens after His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this book we have a full and clear picture of the very Christ who has ascended into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, in this picture we see the scene, the sight, the state in the heavens after Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only when we see this revelation will we worship Him in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. The Lion-Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His ascension, Christ is the Lion-Lamb 5:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist declared, Behold, the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the scene in the heavens after Christ s ascension, Christ is revealed mainly as the Lion, not as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While John was weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it Rev 5:4 , one of the elders said to him, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the crucifixion, there might have been reason for John to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it was foolish for him to weep after the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are you weeping today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are still weeping, it means that you have not seen the vision of the ascended Christ in Revelation 5.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Genesis 49:8 and 9 prophesy concerning Christ as the Lion of Judah, and only in Revelation are we told that Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome and is worthy to open the seals of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After John heard this declaration from one of the elders, he saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He saw the Lion as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is Christ the Lion or the Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we may call Him the Lion-Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why is Christ both the Lion and the Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we have two main problems sin and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most Christians only take care of the sin problem and forget the Satan problem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not think that your husband is so difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not blame him, but blame Satan who is behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, every wife is good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The bad things which come out of our wives do not actually issue from them but from Satan who is behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lamb is versus sin and solves the problem of sin, and the Lion deals with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the Lamb, Christ has accomplished redemption, having washed us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the Lion, He has dealt with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is adequate to meet our needs and to solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now sin is over, Satan has been terminated, and we have been redeemed and rescued from the usurping hand of the enemy.</S>
