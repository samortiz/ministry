If you have not seen the difference between Psalm 1 and Psalm 2, it is rather difficult to go on to Psalm 8. Therefore, before going on to Psalm 8, we must dwell a little more upon Psalms 1 and 2. In chapter one we boldly declared that Psalm 1 is not so positive, especially to us as Christians today. If you are for Psalm 1, you should be an Old Testament saint. You do not belong here. In the church life we must have the New Testament saints, not the Old Testament ones.<h2 class=head1>THE LAW VERSUS CHRIST</h2><p>We have pointed out that in Book I of the Psalms, God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God. It is certain that if you are for the law, it is rather difficult for you to enter the house to enjoy God. We must turn from the law to Christ; then we will be in the house of God and enjoy all His riches.<p>The book of Galatians was written for the very purpose of showing us the difference between the law and Christ. At the time of its writing the Jewish elders were doing their utmost to bring the concept of the law into the churches as a distraction from Christ, a substitute for Christ. Hence, the apostle Paul wrote this letter, telling the saints that the law is something of the past. Now Christ is for us. We are not for the law; we are now for Christ.<p>Galatians 3:24 says that the law was our schoolmaster, or, according to a better translation, our child conductor. (See Conybeare&#8217;s translation of the Epistles of the apostle Paul.) In ancient times, according to Jewish custom, the parents sent their children to a teacher living in a certain house by means of a servant as a child conductor. Paul here likens the law to the child conductor. &#8220;The law was our child conductor to bring us unto Christ.&#8221; Christ is the teacher; the law is the conductor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by faith. &#8220;But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a child conductor&#8221; (v. 25). Christ is come, and Christ dwells in us. The conductor is past; we need the conductor no longer.<p>Galatians 5:4 says, &#8220;Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.&#8221; This is a serious matter. If you attempt to keep the law, Christ is become of no effect to you, and you are fallen from grace. Are you still for the law? If so, the consequence is terrible.<p>The problem of the law issues mainly from two sources: (1) our human, natural, and religious concept, and (2) the poverty of even fundamental Christianity. Many times in Christendom, after people have been brought to grace, they have been helped immediately to keep the law. They have been ushered into a situation of half-grace and half-law. Christians say that they know grace, but they know only fifty percent grace, and, I venture to say, even less than fifty percent. Grace must be one hundred percent; there is no element of law in grace. If you are still for the law, you are fallen from grace. This is not my word or teaching, but my quotation from the holy Word. This is the very concept of God Himself in His Word, especially the New Testament.<p>In Galatians 2:19, Paul said, &#8220;For I through the law am dead to the law.&#8221; Why do you love the law so much? Are you married to the law? I know that when I say Psalm 1 is not so good, many of you will disagree. The first time I spoke of Psalm 1 in this way was in 1956. At that time I offended a number of people. If we did not have the New Testament, but only the Psalms, you may win the case. But today, hallelujah, we have the Psalms, and we also have the New Testament. The Old Testament is just a picture book; the New Testament is the definition. I have the boldness to say that this concept is right, because it is the concept of the New Testament. Through the law I am dead to the law. How could your Christian conscience justify you in delighting in the law? Through the law I am dead to the law; I have nothing to do with the law that I might live unto God. &#8220;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20).<p>Let us go on to Romans 10:4. &#8220;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.&#8221; Are you clear concerning the law? Christ is the end of the law. Then what about Psalm 1? Psalm 2 is the end of Psalm 1. If you have Psalm 2, you may forget about Psalm 1.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the mountain of transfiguration, Peter spoke nonsense. He said, &#8220;Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah&#8221; (Matt. 17:4). Moses was the representative of the law, and Elijah the representative of the prophets. After Peter spoke these words, there came a voice from the heavens, saying, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.&#8221; Then Moses and Elijah disappeared; only Christ was there. And we read that when they had lifted up their eyes, &#8220;they saw no man, save Jesus only.&#8221; There was no more law, no more prophets, only Christ. You see, if you still treasure Psalm 1, it means that you are pitching two tents, one for Christ and one for Moses. That is nonsense. We must hear the voice from the heavens, saying, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, hear ye him&#8221;-only Christ!<p>We may even be so bold as to say that we must put Psalm 2 upon our head and Psalm 1 under our feet. How could we put part of the Bible under our feet? This is not my thought, but the thought of the Bible itself. Turn to Revelation 12. There we see a wonderful, universal woman. &#8220;And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars&#8221; (v. 1). This woman represents all the chosen people of God; she will eventually become the New Jerusalem. She is clothed with the sun, the moon is under her feet, and upon her head are twelve stars. What are these? They are three different dispensations: the dispensation of the sun, the dispensation of the moon, and the dispensation of the twelve stars. Undoubtedly, the New Testament age is the sun. The moon is the Old Testament, the age of the law. The moon is good, but it is much inferior to the sun; likewise, the law is good, but it is far inferior to the New Testament. Now we are in the age of the sun; the age of the moon, the law, is under our feet. The dispensation of the stars is the age of the patriarchs. These are the three dispensations. The age of the patriarchs was the period of the forefathers before the law, from the time of Adam or Abel to Moses. Then from Moses to Christ is the age of the moon-that is the night time. Then Christ came; Christ is the sun. When Christ came, the day dawned, the sun arose. We must realize the position of the law. The age of the law is under our feet. This is the concept of the Bible.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
