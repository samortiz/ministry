<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Abounding and Sufficient Grace</H2><P>The tenth factor is the abounding and sufficient grace (Rom. 5:17; 2 Cor. 12:9; 1 Cor. 15:10).</P><P>We can see from the above ten factors that James's teaching concerning Christian perfection is on the kindergarten level, whereas the entire New Testament teaching concerning the genuine Christian perfection is on the top graduate school level.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Means by Which<br>the Genuine Christian Perfection<br>(Christian Living) Is Carried Out</H2><P>The factors are to produce, to bring forth. They are the source. The means are the carrying out of the genuine Christian perfection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Vision of God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>The first means is the vision of God's eternal economy (Eph. 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4b). Many Christians cannot have the genuine Christian living because they have never seen God's eternal economy. Economy is an anglicized word from the Greek word oikonomia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Organic Body of Christ<br>as the Organism of the Triune God</H2><P>The organic Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God (Eph. 1:23; 4:4-6, 12, 16). The organic Body of Christ is a great means of Christian perfection. If you do not know the church as the Body of Christ, how can you be perfected? Today there is no possibility for those in Christianity to know the genuine, proper Christian perfection in the New Testament, because they have not seen these things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Power of Christ's Resurrection</H2><P>Paul speaks of his desire to know the power of Christ's resurrection in Philippians 3:10. Resurrection is God Himself. The Lord said that He is the resurrection (John 11:25a). The power of resurrection is the power of the almighty, omnipotent God.</P>
