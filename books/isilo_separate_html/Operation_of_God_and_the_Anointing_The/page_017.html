<h1 class="title">THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING<br />
AND THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<p>There are two aspects of our experience of life. The first aspect is the inner operation of the Holy Spirit, that is, the teaching of the anointing (1 John 2:27). The second aspect is the outward discipline of the Holy Spirit through our environment. We need to obey the operation of the Holy Spirit within us and accept the outward discipline in our environment. A believer&rsquo;s growth in life involves developing his inner sense and accepting his environment. The more a saint grows in the divine life, the more he will grow in knowing God through fellowship in obeying the teaching of the anointing. He will also grow in accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit that he encounters in his environment. The more spiritual a person is, the more he will surrender to the anointing and to the discipline in his environment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING SPIRITUAL LESSONS</h2>
<p>The spiritual lessons we learn every day are related both to the anointing within and to what we encounter in our environment. Thus, the spiritual lessons that we need to learn include accepting what we encounter in our environment in coordination with the inner anointing. Many Christians do not seem to experience the inner anointing, nor are they subject to what they encounter in their environment. For this reason, they have not learned any lessons related to the anointing, and although they suffer much pain and affliction, they have not learned any lessons from their environment. They listen to messages, read spiritual books, pray often, and fellowship with the Lord, but they have not learned to live in the anointing, they do not know God&rsquo;s leading, nor do they accept the lessons that God has given them through their environment. Such saints have not grown in the divine life.</p>
<p>In contrast, a person who is growing in life has the inner anointing and lives in the Lord&rsquo;s operation daily. His experience of the anointing is not limited to once or twice a day; rather, he lives in the anointing and follows the inner operation of God throughout the day. Furthermore, he is constantly learning lessons from what he encounters in his environment and is submissive to his circumstances. He learns spiritual lessons whether he is praised or mocked and whether his environment is calm or turbulent. Furthermore, the lessons he learns are not a matter of doctrine or theory; they are experiences of life. He sees how a situation deals with a problem within him and how it causes him to experience the indwelling Christ and to live in the resurrection life so that he may be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>The anointing and the environment are two different dealings and two kinds of leading, but they have the same result. The inner operation of the Holy Spirit is for us to experience resurrection life and be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. The discipline of the Holy Spirit in our environment is also for us to experience resurrection life and be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. What we encounter in our environment coordinates with the anointing within us; our environment and the anointing have only one goal. Hence, when we obey the anointing, what we often encounter in our environment is not severe. If we closely follow the inner anointing, a coordinating discipline in our environment will not be necessary. Then instead of our environment being a matter of discipline, it will be an opportunity for the divine life to mature in us. In many cases the coordination of discipline from our environment is an indication that we have not followed the inner sense of life. God often arranges an outward environment for us when we do not diligently follow the operation of the Spirit through the inner anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Love the Lord</h2>
<p>We can examine our condition by asking, &ldquo;What is the condition of our love for the Lord?&rdquo; Although our love for the Lord cannot be considered a spiritual experience, we must love the Lord in order to have spiritual experiences. No one can have an abundance of the divine life if his love toward the Lord is weak.</p>
<p>Several verses in Ephesians mention love, such as: &ldquo;holding to truth in love&rdquo; (4:15), &ldquo;the building up of itself in love&rdquo; (v. 16), and &ldquo;being rooted and grounded in love&rdquo; (3:17). Love is often more important than faith. The subject of Song of Songs concerns a believer&rsquo;s fellowship with the Lord. No other book in the Bible thoroughly describes the personal fellowship of a believer with the Lord or the growth that results from a believer&rsquo;s union with the Lord in fellowship as much as this book does. Song of Songs rarely mentions faith, but it shows that the condition for fellowship is love (1:2-4; 2:4-5; 3:1-4, 10; 4:10; 5:8; 6:2-3; 7:10-12; 8:6-7). We fellowship with the Lord in love, we are joined to the Lord in love, and we also grow in life in love.</p>
<p>The principle revealed in the Bible is that we receive the divine life by faith, and we grow in the divine life by love. A person who does not believe in the Lord cannot receive the divine life, nor can he grow in the divine life. In order to receive this life, one must receive the Lord, and in order to grow in life, one must also love the Lord. Hence, the Gospel of John says that man receives the divine life by faith&mdash;those who believe will have life (1:12); concerning growing in life, John says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&rdquo; (14:23). Here love is mentioned. The last chapter says even more concerning love. The Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?...Do you love Me?&rdquo; (21:15-17). The first chapter of John speaks of faith, but the last chapter speaks of love. Faith is the means for man to receive life, and love is the means for man to grow in life.</p>
<p>At issue here is whether we love the Lord. We should not think that to serve in the church is the same as to love the Lord. This is not necessarily true. While we are serving in the church, our heart toward the Lord is often cold, and there is often a problem with our love. Every section in Song of Songs is related to love, because every spiritual experience is in the context of love. In the original Hebrew language the words for <em>my beloved</em> (1:13, 16; 2:3, 8-10) and <em>my love</em> (1:9; 2:2, 10) indicate love. The word translated as &ldquo;my beloved&rdquo; is masculine, and the word translated as &ldquo;my love&rdquo; is feminine. Solomon addresses the seeker as &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; and the seeker addresses him also as &ldquo;my love.&rdquo; This shows that spiritual progress is a union in love and fellowship.</p>
<p>Love cannot be stirred up. It would be of little avail for me to call a brother every day from morning until evening, saying, &ldquo;Brother, you should love the Lord! Love the Lord!&rdquo; I cannot cause him to have an ounce of love. I can give messages on loving the Lord and even exhaust my vocabulary, but I cannot make him love the Lord. The Bible does not show us how to love the Lord. In the Epistles Paul says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14), but he does not say how to stir up a person&rsquo;s love for the Lord.</p>
<p>People love things or persons without reason. For example, if you go to a jewelry store and see an item, you may fall in love with it as soon as you see it. You may be able to describe the beauty of the item, but you cannot explain why you fell in love with it at first sight. The beginning of Song of Songs speaks of this: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine... / Your name is like ointment poured forth&rdquo; (1:2-3). Some people say that if we see the Lord, we will love Him. However, many people saw the Lord when He was on earth, but not all of them loved Him. For example, both Martha and Mary saw the Lord, but their love for Him varied in strength. Genuine love has the element of &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo;; that is, a person falls in love the first time he sees an object. Not even death can stop such love. Genuine love for the Lord is without reason.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the Lord do so without reason. No one believes in the Lord because he has weighed all the reasons. If there is such a person, he is not yet saved. Those who believe and are saved do so without reason; they believed even though it did not make sense. If a person believes only after everything makes sense, there is a problem with his faith. This is a mystery. Hence, when we preach the gospel, we should not try to reason with others, because reasoning helps people to understand but not to believe. We need only to say that the Lord Jesus is man&rsquo;s Savior and that He was incarnated, lived on the earth, died, and resurrected. When some people hear this, they believe even though they do not understand everything that they have heard. They do not know who the Lord Jesus is, but they nevertheless believe in Him. This kind of faith is right.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, not every disciple who followed Him knew who He was. They were not clearer than we are and may even have been more confused. When Peter followed the Lord Jesus, he had no idea where the Lord came from (Matt. 4:18-20), but he saw that Jesus was wonderful (Luke 5:8-9). Peter could not comprehend the work of the Holy Spirit; he simply felt that the Lord Jesus was wonderful. He admired the Lord Jesus so much that he believed in Him.</p>
<p>Faith is inexplicable, and love is also inexplicable. This is the story of Song of Songs. For this reason, Song of Songs begins by saying, &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; (1:2). Some people are like this; they cannot help but love the Lord, and they do not know the source of their love. Martha and Mary were two sisters who lived in the same home, had the same opportunities, and were in the same environment, but they had two different kinds of love toward the Lord Jesus. What was the source of this difference in their love? Did the Lord Jesus do something for Mary that He did not do for Martha? We cannot find such a distinction in the Bible. The Lord treated them the same, but one was more earnest in her love for Him than the other.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether we love the Lord. I cannot tell you how to love the Lord, but I must ask whether you love Him. Love is the unique condition for us to experience the Lord&rsquo;s life. There is no other condition; we must love the Lord. Some may say that in order to experience the Lord&rsquo;s life, we must have spiritual understanding and receive revelation. Spiritual understanding and revelation are based on love. Song of Songs speaks solely concerning the growth and maturity of our spiritual life. This book begins with love, continues with love, and ends with love. Hence, Ephesians speaks of &ldquo;being rooted and grounded in love,&rdquo; of &ldquo;holding to truth in love,&rdquo; and of the Body &ldquo;building up...itself in love&rdquo; (3:17; 4:15-16). Without love it is useless to speak of growth in life. Growth in life is not a matter of knowledge but of love. It is possible to understand messages, to read spiritual books, and to study the Bible thoroughly and still not grow in the divine life. Growth in life depends on our love for the Lord.</p>
<p>According to Song of Songs, even if we have only a little love for the Lord, we should seek Him on the basis of this love. Verse 2 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; The more we contact the Lord, the more we will feel that He is lovely. We cannot find a verse in the Bible that tells us how to love the Lord, but the record in the Bible shows that our love for the Lord grows by our seeking Him with what little love that we have. The more we seek Him, the more we will contact Him in fellowship; and the more we fellowship with Him, the more we will feel that He is lovely. Every believer has some love for the Lord, but the question is how to cause our love to increase. If we seek the Lord a little more, admire Him a little more, and fellowship with Him a little more, our love for Him will grow spontaneously.</p>
<p>Song of Songs describes a progressing life and a developing love, both of which grow so strong that it is difficult to determine whether the love in chapter 8 represents the Lord&rsquo;s love or the love of His seeker. Some say that it is the love of the Shulammite for her beloved, but others say it is the love of the beloved for the Shulammite. It is rather difficult to determine who is speaking in chapter 8. As far as the beloved is concerned, his love is stronger than death, but as far as the Shulammite is concerned, she has grown and is rooted and grounded in the love of her beloved. Hence, verses 6 and 7 simply say &ldquo;love,&rdquo; not &ldquo;your love&rdquo; or &ldquo;my love.&rdquo; This love is as strong as death, and floods cannot drown it. At this point, the seeker&rsquo;s union with the Lord in fellowship has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Although we do not have much love for the Lord, if we spend a little more time to long for Him, to seek Him, to consider Him, to fellowship with Him, and to contact Him, our love for Him will increase. The more we seek Him and fellowship with Him, the more we will love Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
