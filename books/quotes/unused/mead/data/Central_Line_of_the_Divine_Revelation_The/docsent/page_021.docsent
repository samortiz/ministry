   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Divine Element, of Which the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Christ Are Made God's Excellent Inheritance,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Dispensed into the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>through God the Son's Redemption unto</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's Economy of the Fullness of the Times,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>to Head Up All Things in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine element, of which the believers in Christ are made God's excellent inheritance, is dispensed into the believers through God the Son's redemption unto God's economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ Eph 1:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God the Son, Christ, has redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This implies that we were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we were saved, we had fallen into at least four categories of things: sin, self, Satan, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ redeemed us through His redeeming death from these negative things into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were in sin, self, Satan, and the world, but now we are in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The phrase in Christ implies a sphere, a realm, and an element.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were in Adam, and Adam was our sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Adam we were fallen, but now we have been redeemed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ has become our sphere and our realm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is also our element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His element is the divine element, the divine substance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be in Christ means that we are in the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Day by day Christ Himself is being worked into us so that He can become our element.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we did not have Christ as our element, how could we be called Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are Christians because we have Christ as our element.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A cup is golden because it has the element of gold within it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a cup does not have any element of gold, it cannot be called a golden cup.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are in Christ, who is our element.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This element has made us an excellent treasure to become God's inheritance Eph 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In ourselves, we are pieces of clay, unworthy for God to inherit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What God desires to inherit is something excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since Christ has become our element, this element makes us excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we are inherited by God as His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to be such an inheritance, the divine element, which is Christ Himself, must be dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was young, I doubted concerning my salvation because I did not have much of the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day I was reading John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I got to the chapter where Christian received some kind of "certificate" which indicated that he had been saved, immediately I stopped reading and began to consider if I had this certificate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The "certificate" was faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time I began to doubt my salvation, and I was very troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I then checked with the Scriptures in portions such as John 3:15-16 and 36, and I read them repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I doubted my salvation because I did not have very much of the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ had not been that constituted into my being, so I doubted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, however, I have no doubts about my salvation because I have had an accumulation of Christ within me; I have a greater amount of Christ within me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ has been and is being dispensed into me as the element.</S>
