   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH FAITH IN GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the Lord is now complete.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His death has taken place, and His resurrection has also taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What happens next?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible shows clearly that God has put all His Son's work in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the Bible, and what is God's Word?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times I like to think of God's Word as God's pocket for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God put all His work into His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God were standing among us today, and He wanted to show us His Son's work and the proof of this work, how could He do it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He put the work of His Son's cross in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also put the proof of His Son's resurrection in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today God communicates all these things to us through His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we receive His Word, we receive the proof of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Behind the Word are the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there were no facts behind the words, the words would be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Behind the words there surely are the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In winter, everyone, both male and female, wears gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's Word is God's glove.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All His works are contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day I met a western female missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She did not know what it was to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She thought that all she needed to do was to believe in God, in His Son Jesus Christ, and in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I told her that without God's Word there is no way to believe in God, in His Son Jesus Christ, and in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we believe in God's Word, all these items become effective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After two hours of talking, I still could not get through with her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, she was about to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She had on a pair of deerskin gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She was about to take off the gloves to shake hands with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I said, "You don't have to take them off.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can shake with your gloves on."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To her this was quite impolite.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps she considered that I was a Chinese and that I did not know proper manners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I shook her hand I asked, "What am I holding now, the hand or the glove?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Immediately she understood what I meant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I told her that the hand was in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I shook the glove, I was shaking the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I shook the glove, because in it was the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is like the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has put Himself and all the work of His Son's cross in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you hand me God's Word, you are handing me God in His Word, plus all the work of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When she left, she told me that everything else that had been said was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This one word cleared her up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we preach to others the work of God's Son and the testimony of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, it is by His Word that we preach these things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man receives God's Word, he receives God's work and God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's Word is precious because in it there is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What use is it if the gloves are empty?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if you squeeze them all day long, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are useful only when the hands are there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the Lord Jesus, the Word of God is dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without the Lord Jesus, I would surely burn this book.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, what is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is nothing other than the receiving of God's testimony for the work of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has placed the work of His Son in the Word and has communicated this Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we believe in His Word, we are believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First John 5:9 says, "If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the characteristic of God's testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"This is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Word of God is concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please read verse 10: "He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please notice the next clause: "Because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is it to not believe in God?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is to not believe in God's testimony of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is to believe in God?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is to believe in the words God has spoken, the testimony that He has made concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, to believe in God is nothing other than to believe in God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the past two weeks, we have seen God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have seen what God has done for us, what problems He has solved through His Son, and what proofs He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has spoken to us His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What should we do now?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should believe in Him, that is, we should receive the testimony He has concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If there are some here who have not been saved, some may have told you already that you should believe.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But what should you believe in?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You do not have to believe in a Christ that is sitting in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That is too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All you have to do is to believe in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is so near.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's hand is already in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The glove is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you believe in God's Word, you are believing in God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you receive the words of the Bible, you are receiving everything in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Over the past eighteen hundred years, George M ller may be considered as one of the men with the greatest faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When others asked him what faith was, he answered that faith is when God says something, I say the same.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Faith is to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is to believe in God through His Word.</S>
