We are very thankful for this. Furthermore, we were greatly enlightened in the matters of the truth to understand the centrality of God and the mystery of the overcomers. We truly cannot fail to be thankful for the Lord's grace and the brothers' earnestness. We are very sorry that on the day after the conference, we left at two o'clock in the morning of February 2 and went to the northern station to take the train home, without saying good-by to you. We hope that you can forgive us for this matter. We were both safe on the train and in the boat. We had sufficient money for our traveling expenses. We arrived at Huai An at 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the third and stayed for one night at Mr. Yin's house. We will be home tomorrow before noon. We are sending this letter so you will not worry. We also thank the Lord for being with us on our journey. With no further things in our mind, we ask the Lord to bless you brothers with peace.</P><P>Your brothers,<br>Yen Cheng Piao and Niu Wen Kan<br>P.S. Please greet the brothers and sisters in Shanghai for us, especially Messrs. Chi and the Senior Mr. Wu, Mr. Chiu, Mr. Feng, and Mr. Ting.<br>February 3</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM CHEFOO, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Mr. Nee:</P><P>(Parts omitted.) We had a ten-day meeting here beginning on February 14 (the first day of the first month of the Chinese calendar) and ending on February 25. We presented the main points of The Centrality of God and The Overcomer of God before the brothers and sisters here. We have also seen the Lord's blessing. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>In the past few days, the responsible brothers and sisters have seen the need to preach the gospel for a few days to the outsiders. Therefore, we will have gospel meetings every day in the afternoon and evening from now until the tenth of the month.</P><P>The Lord willing, after these gospel meetings are over, we will spend another week to speak something concerning the truth of Christ's Body to the brothers and sisters in the evening. All this requires petitions. Please do not forget to pray.</P><P>The brothers here are doing quite well. The things we have passed through have caused them to grow in reality and learn "how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God." Some brothers have really grown. The brothers have already decided to have a brothers' meeting and make a baptismal pool because there are still a few brothers and sisters who want to be baptized.</P><P>Concerning the matter of moving to Shanghai, I felt that the Lord will eventually bring this about. With regard to this matter, I saw the clear light in Acts that there is only one line in the Lord's work. I have already told the responsible brothers here. In the beginning they opposed a little, but now they have taken a turn. I hope I can leave Chefoo for Shanghai before April.</P><P>I have recently received a letter from Brother Yuan Chin Chou. Perhaps this letter could be published as news for Collection of Newsletters. I am enclosing it here as well.</P><P>Has Miss Lee gone to Tsinan? When are you leaving Shanghai? Have you received the manuscripts for The Gospel? Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Witness Lee</P>March 5, 1934<br><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM LING TZU, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the bondslave of God, our Brother Nee and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>We thank our God and you brothers and sisters for your prayer for us. During this conference the weather was clear, and there was no hindrance from rainstorms even once. God's grace is sufficient for us that it may be perfected in us without lack (1 Kings 17:14). We can only give glory to God and the Lamb! Amen. We thank and praise God again. He manifested His almighty hand and healed a woman who was dying of tuberculosis. Her father and doctor said that there was no hope, but the ways of God are wonderful! He blesses His own work. Over ten brothers and sisters believed in the Lord and are willing to get baptized from this meeting. May the Triune God give us a good opportunity and an appropriate place.</P><P>We lack the sisters' work here (Nieh Tao Hung of Kuang Jao also feels this lack). May God Himself work and lead His servants to help. We bless you with peace in the Lord! Greet all the brothers and sisters for us!</P><P>Your brothers in the Lord,<br>Chu Le Yuan, Yu Tao Shen, Niu Teh Ch'ing<br>Yuan Hsi Ting, Yuan Hsi Ling, and Yuan Chin Chou</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
