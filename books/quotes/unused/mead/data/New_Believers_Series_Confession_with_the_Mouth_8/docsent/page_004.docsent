   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Fear of Men</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people dare not confess because they are afraid of men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people can honestly say that they have no other reservation in their heart; they are willing to stand up and confess, but when they see the faces of others, they become afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they look at their parents' faces or their friends' faces, they feel too shy to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is where many people are stumbled; they are afraid of men and do not have any boldness to open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people are naturally timid; they are timid not only in confessing the Lord but also in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you want them to tell others about their faith, you are asking them for their life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They simply dare not open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this kind of person needs to hear what God has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Proverbs 29:25 says, "The fear of man bringeth a snare."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are afraid when you see someone, you will fall into a "snare."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as you become afraid, you fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your fear becomes your snare.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever your heart is afraid of men, you are creating a snare for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once you are afraid, you fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This snare is created by your own fear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the person you fear may be very willing to listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if he is not inclined to listen, he may not be as fearsome as you think.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a story about two persons who were colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One was a believer and the other was not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The one who believed was very timid; the one who did not believe was also very timid.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The timid believer did not dare tell his colleague that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one who did not believe was puzzled by the great changes that were happening to his colleague.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His colleague used to have a quick temper but had now changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He dared not ask his colleague the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The two of them shared a table and sat face-to-face every day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One was too timid to speak, and the other was too timid to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day they just looked at each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One was afraid to speak, and the other was afraid to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day the believer could not hold back any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After praying about it, he went to the other one and shook his hand tightly and said, "I am a very timid person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For at least three months I have been struggling to tell you something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now I am going to tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have believed in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After saying these words, his face turned pale.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The other one said, "I too have waited for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I wanted to ask why you have become so different, but I was too afraid to ask."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The believer mustered enough courage to open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From that time on, the opportunity opened up, and he was able to bring his friend to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are fearful of men will fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please remember that while you are afraid of others, others may be afraid of you too.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must never have a fear of men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We who follow God should not fear men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have a fear of men, you cannot be a good Christian and you cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A Christian must be bold to speak to his relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He must be bold to confess the Lord both in private and in public.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must take this way from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. Being Shy</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people are shy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They feel that it is a shameful thing to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is true that this kind of shame may exist when we face unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you tell others that you are engaged in technical research, they will congratulate you for having a good future.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you say that you are studying a certain philosophy, others will also say that you are a thoughtful person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are not ashamed to talk about doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you say that you are a Christian, many will say that you are too simple-minded or not intellectual enough.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They will not esteem you highly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You are not ashamed to talk about other things, but as soon as you confess your Christian faith, you feel ashamed within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is unavoidable for a new believer to feel shameful when he opens his mouth to confess his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we must overcome this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is true that the world feels shameful about someone becoming a Christian, but we must overcome this feeling.</S>
