Thus, the promise here indicates that God Himself would come to be a human seed to bruise the head of the damaging serpent. Ultimately, the seed of the woman is enlarged to include the overcoming believers, the stronger part of God's people, signified by the man-child in Rev. 12:5 (see note 2 there). The man-child, the corporate seed of the woman, includes the Lord Jesus, the individual seed of the woman. Psalm 2:8-9, Rev. 2:26-27, and Rev. 12:5 indicate that the Lord Jesus as God's Anointed, the overcomers in the churches, and the man-child will rule the nations with an iron rod, thus proving that the Lord Jesus, the overcomers, and the man-child are one. The Lord as the leading Overcomer (Rev. 3:21) is the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the man-child, and the man-child as the following overcomers is the Lord's Body.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh and did not have the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). This was typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites (Num. 21:9; John 3:14). The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of the actual serpent but did not have its poison. It was such a bronze serpent that bore God's judgment for the poisoned Israelites and dealt with the serpents that poisoned them.<br>Although Christ did not have the sin of the flesh, He was crucified in the flesh (Col. 1:22; 1 Pet. 3:18). Thus, on the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him (John 12:31; 16:11), thereby destroying Satan (Heb. 2:14). At the same time, through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh. As a result, it is possible for us to walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us (v. 4).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

God's blessing of Abraham eventually issued in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth are blessed (Acts 3:25-26; Gal. 3:16). All the believers in Christ, as members of the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12), are included in this seed as the heirs of God's promised blessing (Gal. 3:7, 29 and note 291).<br>In this chapter Christ is revealed in three ways: as the Angel of Jehovah (vv. 11-12, 15-18), as the ram (v. 13), and as the seed of Abraham (v. 18).

But Jesus was introduced to them as a little lamb with a little dove (vv. 29-33). The Lamb takes sin away from man, and the dove brings God as life to man. The Lamb is for redemption, to redeem fallen man back to God, and the dove is for life-giving, for anointing, to anoint man with what God is, to bring God into man and man into God, and for uniting the believers in God. Both the Lamb and the dove are needed for man to participate in God.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_11967' href='#ref_11967'>Matt 1:1</a></span> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:<br><b>fn 1 par 3 </b>Christ, as the wonderful center of the entire Bible, is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. Mark's account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God's people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Christ is also the element in which and with which the church is built. Hence, Christ is the house, His Body (John 2:19-21; 1 Cor. 12:12), and Christ is also the seed, the Builder. Christ builds the church by building Himself into us, i.e., by entering into our spirit and spreading Himself from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will to occupy our entire soul (Eph. 3:17). This building, a mingling of God's divinity with our redeemed, resurrected, and uplifted humanity, becomes God's habitation and our habitation-a mutual abode (John 14:23; 15:4). Eventually, this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem for eternity, in which God's redeemed are the tabernacle for God to dwell in and God Himself is the temple for His redeemed to dwell in (Rev. 21:3, 22).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

If he commits iniquity, I will strike him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;<br><b>fn 1 par 1 </b>The word concerning your seed in v. 12 and My son in v. 14 implies that the seed of David would become the Son of God, i.e., that a human seed would become a divine Son. This word corresponds with Paul's word in Rom. 1:3-4 concerning Christ as the seed of David being designated the Son of God in His humanity in resurrection (see note 41 there). It also relates to the Lord's question in Matt. 22:41-45 concerning how the Christ could be both the son of David and the Son of God as David's Lord-a wonderful person, a God-man with two natures, divinity and humanity. These verses clearly unveil that a seed of man, i.e., a son of man, can become the Son of God. God Himself, the divine One, became a human seed, the seed of a man, David. This seed was Jesus, the God-man, Jehovah the Savior (Matt. 1:18-21; 2 Tim. 2:8), who was the Son of God by virtue of His divinity alone (Luke 1:35). Through His resurrection He as the human seed became the Son of God in His humanity as well. Thus, in Christ God was constituted into man, man was constituted into God, and God and man were mingled together to be one entity, the God-man. This implies that God's intention in His economy is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Christ is the child born of both the divine and human natures (Matt. 1:20-23), and He is also the Son in the divine nature given by the Eternal Father. Through the birth of the divine-human child, the Eternal Father gave us His divine Son as a gift. Through such a giving, everyone who believes in, i.e., receives, this dear Son receives eternal life (John 3:16; 1 John 5:11-12). See note 14<sup>1</sup> in ch. 7.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_11983' href='#ref_11983'>Gal 3:14</a></span> In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<br><b>fn 3 </b>This verse indicates that the Spirit is the blessing that God promised to Abraham for all the nations and that has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit, as mentioned in note 52, and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension that we may receive Him as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God.<br>The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see Col. 1:12 and note 2). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the land promised to Abraham. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
