   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO HAS BLESSED US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The God whom we bless has blessed us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s well-speaking concerning us encompasses the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament God speaks well regarding us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are filled with God s beautiful speech concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 22:14 is an example of God s well-speaking: Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words, Grace to you and peace 1:2 , are also part of God s well-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you want to hear God s well-speaking, you need to read the New Testament and say amen to every aspect of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He chose us before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He chose us to be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We bless God, because God has blessed us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because He has spoken so well concerning us, we return the well-speaking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, when we read about the redemption of our body, we should say, God, how I thank You that You have come into me, that You are saturating me with Yourself, and that one day this saturation will be expressed through my body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That will be the day of the redemption of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God, how I thank You for this!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To speak like this is to return the well-speaking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, He blesses you, and you bless Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Learn to speak well concerning God according to His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After listening to God s well-speaking concerning us, we are qualified to speak well of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are qualified because we are His creatures, His redeemed ones, and His regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the blessings, benefits, and bounties in the universe are of three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first category is God s creation, the second is God s redemption, and the third is God s regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God s creation we enjoy so many good things: air, sunshine, minerals, animal life, vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these are good things of God s creation, and we are qualified to partake of them because we are God s creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, as the redeemed ones, we enjoy forgiveness of sins, justification by faith, reconciliation in God s grace, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we are redeemed, all the benefits in God s redemption are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, because we have been regenerated, we enjoy God s life, His nature, and His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By these three qualifications being created, redeemed, and regenerated we are fully and thoroughly qualified to enjoy all the blessings in the universe, the blessings in God s creation, redemption, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The angels may be sinless, but they are not qualified to enjoy all these blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But through the blood of Christ, we enjoy forgiveness of sins, the washing of the blood, justification by faith, and peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We enjoy all the blessings of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, we daily enjoy all the benefits and bounties of God s regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What could be higher than this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we enjoy the Creator, the Redeemer, and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the second aspect of well-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>WITH EVERY SPIRITUAL BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN THE HEAVENLIES IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The third aspect of well-speaking is that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has blessed us with His good, fine, and fair speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every such speaking is a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 4 through 14 are an account of such speakings, such blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All these blessings are spiritual, in the heavenlies, and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A. Every</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word every indicates the all-inclusiveness of God s blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It includes all, with no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>B. Spiritual</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these blessings are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates the relationship of God s blessings to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Being spiritual, all the blessings with which God has blessed us are related to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit of God is not only the channel, but also the reality, of God s blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this verse, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are all related to the blessings bestowed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is actually God s dispensation of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s blessing is mainly the dispensation of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>C. In the Heavenlies</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, these spiritual blessings are in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Heavenlies here indicates not only the heavenly place, but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere of the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are from the heavens with a heavenly nature, heavenly state, heavenly characteristic, and heavenly atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The believers in Christ are enjoying on earth these heavenly blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are heavenly as well as spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are different from the blessings with which God blessed Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those were physical and earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The blessings bestowed upon us are of God the Father, in God the Son, through God the Spirit, and in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>D. In Christ</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Finally, all these spiritual blessings are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ is the virtue, the instrument, and the sphere in which God has blessed us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Outside of Christ, without Christ, God has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But in Christ He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not in ourselves, but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are in ourselves, we are through with God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hallelujah, we are in Christ, who is the sphere, the channel, the instrument, and the virtue in which we have been blessed!</S>
