<h2 class=head1>LOVING THE LORD AND LETTING HIM MAKE HIS HOME IN YOU</h2><p>In order for you to have this exercise, you need to do two things. First, every day you need to pray, “O Lord, I love You. Lord, draw me that I may love You more. O Lord, cause the love in me to be strong, burning, fresh, and sweet day by day. O Lord, I love You.”<p>Second, do not try to do anything for the Lord to prove that you love Him. Instead, tell the Lord, “Lord, I love You. Come and make Your home in me. I love You. I long for You to come and make Your home in me.” That the Lord will come to make His home in us is not a small thing; rather, it is a very great thing. As the Lord of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things, the Lord Jesus became flesh, passed through death, and entered into resurrection. Hence, all things belong to Him. The resurrection life and the riches of the Spirit are His. Today you need to tell Him, “Lord Jesus, I love You. Come and abide in me.” When you say this, He will accept and come into you to abide in you. The Lord Jesus said, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him” (John 14:23). Thank the Lord, He is the all-inclusive Spirit, and He is real and living. When He comes to abide with us, we enjoy His presence. The sweetness, the rest, the comfort, the strength, and the inward supply are beyond description. In this way we experience and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head1>BEING A PERSON IN SPIRIT</h2><p>The New Testament tells us, “Unceasingly pray” (1 Thes. 5:17); “Do not quench the Spirit” (v. 19); and “By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit” (Eph. 6:18). Eventually, Revelation, the last book of the Bible, tells us, “I was in spirit on the Lord’s Day” (1:10a). What the Bible shows us at the end is a person who is in spirit. Every one of us should pray, “Lord, make me a person in spirit, and make every day of my life on the earth a Lord’s Day. I really want to be in spirit on the Lord’s Day.” This is good enough. Here you have the church life, not religion. Everyone is in spirit. You are in spirit, and I also am in spirit. Every brother is in spirit, and also every sister is in spirit. We are all in spirit. As a result, we are together here as the church today, and in the future we will be together as the New Jerusalem. This is the union and mingling of God and man; God is in man, and man is in God. The divine Spirit and our human spirit become one spirit, and we live and walk according to this spirit. Hallelujah! This is God’s eternal purpose and His greatest pleasure.<p>Dear brothers and sisters, do you love God? Do you love the Lord? What is the Lord’s greatest delight? It is that you and He become one spirit and that you live and walk according to the spirit. You would not care about others’ criticisms, neither would you care about any regulations. All you would care about is to love the Lord, to be one spirit with Him, to fellowship with Him in spirit, and to walk in the Spirit. You live, walk, and have your being in the Lord as the Spirit. This is glory, life, light, power, enrichment, victory, spirituality, and holiness; this is also the church life. One day this will be the manifestation of the New Jerusalem. Do you see this? This is different from religion. Hallelujah, the Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwells in us to be joined with us as one spirit! Today we pray in this spirit, fellowship with the Lord in this spirit, and live and walk in this spirit.
