<h2 class="head1">THE POWER AND CHARACTERISTICS OF GOD<br />
MANIFESTED IN HIS CREATION</h2>
<p>In the history of mankind the righteousness of God is not revealed, but the wrath of God is. &ldquo;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divinity, for them to be without excuse&rdquo; (1:18-20). God&rsquo;s eternal power and His divinity, which is the divine characteristics of God manifested in His creation, is a very good point for gospel preaching. People may say that they do not know God and may even ask where God is. Paul preaches the gospel of God in Romans beginning from God, not from sin. Today we have to do the same thing. We must present God to people. Paul presented God in the way of pointing out God&rsquo;s eternal power and God&rsquo;s personal characteristics expressed in His creation. Divinity means the divine characteristics of God.</p>
<p>Anyone who looks at the universe scientifically and objectively can realize that the universe itself indicates a certain extraordinary power. This power is actually the eternal power. The brothers who are going to the campuses to preach the gospel have to study much to find the evidences of this eternal power which is shown in the creation. Without such an eternal, unlimited power, there could never be such a universe. By looking at the universe, you can see the power, the eternal power, the unlimited power, of God.</p>
<p>By looking at the universe we can also see the personal characteristics of this divine Being. Every attribute of God is a divine characteristic. Light is one of God&rsquo;s many attributes. This attribute or characteristic of God is expressed in God&rsquo;s creation of the universe. This is why the entire universe is not under darkness but in light. In Genesis 1:3 God said, &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo; It would be helpful to study some science to find out something concerning the light in Genesis 1 to help you in the preaching of the gospel. Genesis 1 also mentions the &ldquo;fourth-day lights&rdquo; such as the light of the sun, the light of the moon, and the light of the stars. James refers to God as the &ldquo;Father of the lights&rdquo; (1:17). Lights in this verse refer to the heavenly luminaries. The Father is the Creator, the source, of these shining bodies. God created all the luminaries such as the sun, moon, and stars so He is the Father, the source, of the luminaries, the lights.</p>
<p>Beauty is another one of God&rsquo;s characteristics or attributes. The universe is beautiful. Only a beautiful person would and could create something beautiful. The universe is also full of life. Three categories of life can be seen in creation: the plant life, the animal life, and the human life. All these different types of life point to the very God who Himself is life.</p>
<p>Our God being manifested in His creation is a great truth which we need to teach to the Lord&rsquo;s children. He is manifested in the aspect of His eternal, unlimited power, and He is also manifested in the aspect of His characteristics such as light, beauty, and life. Light, beauty, and life are a few of the many characteristics or attributes of God which show how marvelous He is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE AS<br />
THE LAW TO THE GENTILES</h2>
<p>Romans 2:14 and 15 say, &ldquo;For when the nations, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves: who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing joint witness, and their reasonings accusing or else excusing one another.&rdquo; This is the human conscience as the law to the Gentiles. God gave the outward law to the Jews, so the Jews have to behave and act before God according to the God-given, outward law. God did not give the Gentiles an outward law, but in the nature of every human being there is a conscience, and that conscience is in the function of the law. The function of the conscience is just the same as the function of the law. The Jews are under the law condemned by God, and the Gentiles are also condemned before God according to their conscience. The conscience works to accuse you or excuse you. When the conscience accuses you it means that you are wrong, and when it excuses you it means that you are right. There is something within you by nature, in your nature, that condemns, accuses you or justifies, excuses you. This is a major point for you to study with the help of the Life-study Messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPITIATION-COVER<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p>Romans 3:23-26 says, &ldquo;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus: whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness in respect of the passing by of the sins that occurred before in the forbearance of God; for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus.&rdquo; The crucial point in these verses is the propitiation-cover for God&rsquo;s justification. Very few know what the propitiation-cover for God&rsquo;s justification of His chosen people is. The propitiation-cover is typified by the lid, the cover, of the ark in the Old Testament tabernacle (Exo. 25:17, 21). The ark has a cover on the top of it and on the day of atonement the blood was sprinkled on that cover. The King James Version of the Bible refers to this cover as the mercy seat, where God met with His people. Above this seat were the cherubim, signifying God&rsquo;s glory; underneath the cover and inside the ark was the law of the ten commandments, exposing and condemning by its righteous requirement the sin of the people who came to contact God (Exo. 25:16-22). Above the lid was the glory of God and underneath the lid was the law of God. The glory of God requires that God&rsquo;s people should match His glory, and the law of God requires His chosen people to have the proper righteousness with God and with man. Since no one can answer these two kinds of requirements or fulfill them, there is the need of Christ&rsquo;s redemption fully symbolized by the blood sprinkled upon this cover (Lev. 16:12-16). This blood satisfies God in answering the requirement of His glory and in answering the requirement of His law. By this redemption God can justify His people in the Old Testament time and in the New Testament time. This is the propitiation-cover for God&rsquo;s justification of His chosen people.
