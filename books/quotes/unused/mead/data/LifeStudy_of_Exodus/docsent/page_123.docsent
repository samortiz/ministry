   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE HEAVENLY DIET MANNA 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 16:4-5, 13b-15, 31; Num 11:6b-9 III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ITS CHARACTERISTICS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now turn to the various characteristics of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Exodus 16 and Numbers 11 we are given a brief description of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this short description at least fourteen aspects of manna are pointed out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every aspect is one of the characteristics of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. From Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first characteristic of manna is that it came from heaven 16:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, manna is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we do not know the essence or substance of manna, we know that it came from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Exodus 16:4 the Lord said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Manna is difficult to analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No doubt, it contained nourishment to meet all the requirements of man s physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, it could not have sustained God s people those many years in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, manna has all the elements needed to sustain man s physical body; on the other hand, manna is a heavenly food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as we cannot analyze or explain manna, we cannot analyze or explain the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ was sent from heaven by the Father to be the real manna.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the bread which came from heaven, He is the food by which God s people live.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 6:51 the Lord Jesus said, I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who can analyze the essence of Christ as our heavenly food?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is impossible to analyze His substance scientifically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But although we cannot analyze Christ s essence or fully explain it, He is nonetheless very real.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is invisible and intangible but He is substantial, and He sustains God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the time of the Roman Empire until today, many earthly governments and world leaders have tried to quench the Lord s move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have also attempted to destroy and annihilate His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But all their efforts have been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ s Body could not be destroyed because within the church there is a heavenly essence, a heavenly element, which sustains the church in its sojourn on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Christ imparts this element into the church, nothing can destroy it or terminate it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as manna sustained nearly two million people in the wilderness for forty years, so Christ as the real manna sustains the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This manna does not have its source on earth; it comes down from heaven where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, manna is not only heavenly food, but also godly food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is the bread out of heaven ; on the other hand, He is the bread of God, the One who came down out of heaven to be our food John 6:32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. With the Dew</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Exodus 16:13 and 14 we see that manna came with the dew: In the morning the dew lay round about the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This small, round thing was manna.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Numbers 11:9 also tells us that manna came with the dew; And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is significant that in sending the quails God used the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in sending the manna, God used dew.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly God could have sent the manna without the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fact that manna came with the dew must have a definite spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because my experience of this is not yet complete, I cannot explain fully why manna came with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But according to spiritual experience, I can point out that the dew signifies daily grace, the grace we receive each day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Psalm 133:3 we read of the dew of Hermon...the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The dew of Hermon signifies grace which descends from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, the highest place, from which the dew descends.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The dew signifies the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Dew is different from rain, snow, or frost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is softer than rain and not as cold as frost.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Lamentations 3:22 and 23, God s mercy, like the dew, is fresh every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mercy in the Old Testament eventually issues in the grace of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, Jeremiah used the word mercy in Lamentations 3.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every morning the Lord s grace is as fresh as the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have pointed out a number of times that grace is God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God reaches us in a positive manner, full of mercy and compassion, He becomes grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Manna always comes by means of this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We encourage the saints to practice morning watch at the beginning of each day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, although we may regularly have morning watch, often during our time with the Lord in the morning we do not experience the freshness of dew.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Consequently, we do not gather any manna.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, the Word seems merely to be letters in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But whenever we experience the dew in the morning watch, we know that God reaches us and visits us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This visitation of God is the Lord as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our experience testifies that where the dew is, there manna is also.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we have dew as we read the Word in the morning, the Word truly is food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not have the refreshing dew, we cannot have the manna that comes with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This picture of the manna and the dew is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Truly a picture is better than a thousand words!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The dew in the morning is refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without this dew, this grace, we are very dry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But with the dew we are watered and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thank the Lord that manna comes not by itself, but with the dew.</S>
