   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From Chungking to Kuei-yang</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Beloved sisters in the Lord, Miss Lee, Mrs. Yuan, and Miss Chang:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank the Father that I arrived safely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We left on the thirtieth and spent three days on the road.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we passed through danger several times, I did not feel at all afraid, because God was with me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The road we took was in the steep, high mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the second day, we were winding around the highest, biggest mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We made twenty-four turns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We traveled for two hours before we got around this mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There were small villages along the way where we could eat and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first night we slept in the County Girls' School in Chi-Jiang County.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principal welcomed us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The hospitality was good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the second night was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were no houses to take lodging in, and the bus got stuck in a hole, so we were in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fortunately, there were small rocks in the mud that held the wheels, or many people on the bus would have been killed or injured.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank and praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How great is the length, breadth, height, and depth of God's love!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are weak and very immature children in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is not much spiritual growth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I desire and pursue all wisdom and knowledge in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I deeply hope that the sisters in the Lord will help me that I may be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I think of the testimonies that I heard in Chungking and the two times I dined together with you at the Lord's table, my heart is extremely happy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When will Sister Lee and Sister Chang come to Kweichow?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May God lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you can come soon, we will be happier.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your weak sister in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chang Chiung-sien</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Lin Yau-huei has been transferred to Wu-Chow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He left K'un-ming on the tenth of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We had hoped that Brother Lin would not be transferred, because there are not many responsible brothers in K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, God's will is higher than man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We deeply believe that God wants to raise up His testimony in Wu-Chow through Brother Lin and Brother Muo Hue-chen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we happily said, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Hu Shuan-ming from Lung-Si, Fukien, who works in Parliament arrived in Chungking on the sixteenth of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We hope that he can be edified much with the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are exceptionally diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May God Himself repay the love they have shown for His name's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I heard that Brother Yin Tzu-lan and his family and Brother Chou Hung-bao left Hong Kong on the nineteenth for K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have already rented a very spacious house for Brother Yin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The rent is a little high.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I deeply believe that God prepared this house for our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank the Father for manifesting evidence that He graces His children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The S. W. University's Engineering College was originally going to be in Mong-Tze but has suddenly been changed to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, Brother Yin was able to come.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe that God has His good will in causing Brother Yin to come to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The assembly here has been blessed by God very much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Seventeen brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord's name in March.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not long afterwards, more brothers and sisters wanted to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The meetings have been preserved by God since Brother Wei and Brother Chen went to Ku-Jiu.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are progressing day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that God will give a great revival to the church in K'un-ming so that more saved ones will be added to His church.</S>

   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We meet freely with the brothers and sisters together because our number is so small.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If there were more people, we could not meet like this because we do not have a name or an organization.</S>
