   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE FOUR GREAT MATTERS IN THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; John 14:16-20; 16:13-15; Matt 28:19; Eph 2:18; 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The One into whom we believe is the divine and mysterious Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because it pleased the Triune God to reveal Himself to His children, He used the limited language of mankind to make known, in time, His heart's desire in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we study the whole New Testament in depth, we can see that He revealed four great matters: first, the economy of God; second, the dispensing of God; third, the union of God with the believers; and fourth, the corporate expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>FOUR GREAT MATTERS AND FOUR LAYERS OF VEILS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These four matters are so great, so high, and so mysterious that they are beyond human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have been revealed in a very special way in the Bible, in particular in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, readers of the Bible should ask the Lord for a spirit of wisdom and revelation lest they do not see the light of these four matters because of the influence of their natural, human, religious, and moral concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone who reads the Bible has a fourfold problem natural concepts, human concepts, religious concepts, and ethical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The problem of these four kinds of concepts becomes a thick four-layered veil that covers our inner eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unless we remove every one of these four layers of veils, it will be difficult for us to see the four divine matters revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>JOHN THE BAPTIST LIVING IN A "WILD" WAY AS THE FORERUNNER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps some will ask, "If we reject our moral, religious, human, and natural concepts, won't we be abnormal?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is exactly what we will be!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the beginning of the New Testament a forerunner appeared John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While he was still a child under the care of his parents, he could not decide anything on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when he began his ministry after he had become a full-grown man, he acted contrary to what is natural, contrary to what is human, contrary to religion, contrary to morality, and even contrary to culture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his behavior we see that he was against these five categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing that John the Baptist did was to leave everyone and go live alone in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the statutes of the law, since he was born into a priestly family and his father was a priest, he was a priest by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Old Testament regulations, a priest should have lived near the temple, and he should have spent most of his time serving in the temple at least in the outer court if not within the sanctuary .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, John the Baptist not only did not stay in the holy temple, he did not even stay in the holy city, Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, he left the people to live alone in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not just go to the wilderness to work during the day and then return to the holy city to rest at night.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible says that he lived in the wilderness Luke 1:80 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, he wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle, and ate locusts and wild honey.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything in his living was "wild."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that he had abandoned everything natural, everything human, and all the things of tradition, religion, ethics, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the forerunner in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning of the New Testament dispensation this forerunner took the lead to stand against everything natural and everything of tradition, religion, ethics, and even culture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regrettably, almost none of the Bible expositors, including theologians, have a clear idea about the significance of the living of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one has ever pointed out that John lived in the wilderness and that he ate locusts and wild honey.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The place where he stayed and the food that he ate were all wild.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may say that his food, clothing, dwelling, and transportation were all wild.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He left the people to live alone, not in the holy temple, nor in the holy city, nor in his priestly home, but in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He lived and worked in the wilderness; all his living and all his activities were carried out in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, the garment he wore was not woven by human labor; rather, it was a garment of camel's hair.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no clear record in the Bible that shows how this garment of camel's hair was made.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we can be sure that there was not much fine workmanship at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is very likely that John simply put the camel's skin with the camel's hair upon himself as a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, he had "a leather girdle around his loins" Matt 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Like the garment of camel's hair, this leather girdle was probably not made with much workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A strong proof of the way John the Baptist lived is that his food was locusts and wild honey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In any case, after reading the record of John's living, people always have the impression that John had a wild flavor.</S>
