The Judgment of Any Iniquity or Any Sin</H2><P>In 19:15-21 there is a word about the judgment of any iniquity or any sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Be Done at the Word of Two or Three Witnesses</H2><P>The judgment of any iniquity or any sin was to be done at the word of two or three witnesses (v. 15). It was not adequate to have just one witness. Two were required, and it was better to have three.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. A Malicious Witness Rising Up against a Man</H2><P>If a malicious witness rose up against a man to testify against him of wrongdoing, the two men who had the dispute were to stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges (vv. 16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c.

This kind of criminal judgment thus became a warning to the rest of the people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Their Eye Not Pitying</H2><P>Their eye was not to pity. Instead, there was to be "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot" (v. 21).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
