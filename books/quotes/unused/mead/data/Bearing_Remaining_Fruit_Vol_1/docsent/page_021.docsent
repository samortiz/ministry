   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, Ephesians 1:23 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Bible expositors have said that Body is a metaphor, an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body in Ephesians is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is a Body, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Body may appear to be an organization, but in actuality it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A table assembled together from twenty interlaced pieces of wood is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A mere pile of wood, however, is not considered an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is only when we organize this pile of wood piece by piece that it is an organization, such as a table or a bookshelf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our body may look like an organization, but it is not; it is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An organization does not have life and activity, but our body has both life and activity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If life ceases, all our members can no longer move.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When life is gone, there is no activity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is an organism in the divine life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is joined and knit together as an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 1:22-23 says, The church,...the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Christ is the One who fills all in all, and the church is His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may illustrate fullness with a cup of water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may be water in a cup, but people cannot see it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the cup is not full, the water is hidden in it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the cup is filled with water to its limit and the water overflows, there is the fullness of the water, which is also the expression of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now what is in the cup can be clearly seen by all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Similarly, the church is the overflow of Christ, and the overflowing of Christ is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fullness is the expression of the overflow of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fullness is not something an organization can express.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, fullness is a condition of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When life grows to a certain extent, there is an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may illustrate this with a newborn babe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A newborn is small, short, and very thin; this is its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, when he grows unto the fullness of life, he is expressed in his tallness and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the expression of his fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Chinese express the riches of China, while the Americans express the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When many American brothers were young, they were small and thin, but now they have all become very big, being filled with American eggs, chicken, steak, oranges, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All this food passed through them in digestion, producing organic changes and becoming their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now they are the aggregate of all these riches, and this aggregate is the expression of the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we eat Christ and enjoy Christ, the more we become His overflow and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have this light and see the church according to this light, we will realize that the church cannot be found in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is not merely the accumulation of all the baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an organization, a gathering, but not the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today in the Lord s recovery we do not want an organization or merely a gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, we need an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, we are hoping to change the big meetings, because it is easy for the big meetings merely to be a gathering, an organization, which lacks the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We want to have many small home meetings to allow life to grow from within.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not a matter of work but of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As life grows, it produces a condition the fullness of Christ to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the called-out assembly of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The House of God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Third, the church is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not understand the meaning of house completely according to our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>House can refer both to a dwelling place and a family.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The family is a house, and the dwelling place is also a house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Greek language these are the same word with the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The house of God is the dwelling place of God, His family, and also the members of His household.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is not only the house of God, but also the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is this group of family members as a household.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the function of this household, this house?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul said that the church is the pillar and base of the truth 1 Tim 3:15b .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This word is based on the architecture of the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, the land of Judah and of ancient Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jewish and ancient Greek constructions began with a base, pillars were built on top of it, and then the rest of the building continued upward.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the entire construction was supported by the pillars on this base.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is what it means to be the pillar and the base.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To God, the church has this kind of function to bear all that God is as the reality, the truth, of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The word reality is better than truth in conveying the proper meaning, because truth can be misunderstood as doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This may cause people to think that the church holds doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No, the church is not for holding doctrines but for holding the reality of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the universe, only God is reality; all that He is is reality, which is borne by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are here as the church, the house and household of God, holding the reality of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God Manifested in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First Timothy 3:16 says, Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This word refers not only to Christ but also to all the elements in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In other words, not only is Christ the great mystery of godliness, but in principle the church is the same; the church is God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, God was manifested in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today God is also manifested in the flesh in the church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can prove this from the sequence in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The end of this portion says, Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If this mystery refers only to Christ, then Christ s being taken up in glory should precede His being preached among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Here, however, being taken up in glory is after being believed on in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This proves that the great mystery of godliness includes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This gives us a comprehensive understanding and knowledge concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In application, however, we need to lead the new ones item by item according to their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to let them know that the church is the called-out assembly of God; the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ as His expression; the church is the house of God, which holds all that God is as the reality; and at the same time the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Perhaps they cannot fully understand all this, but after a while they will know it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is similar to learning mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the beginning we learn addition, finding it very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then we learn subtraction, feeling that is a bit more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After that we learn multiplication and division, and we may find memorizing the multiplication table to be even harder.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At the time we are learning all these things, we do not thoroughly understand them, but through more learning, we gradually come to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our leading the new ones is in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>At the beginning they may not understand, but gradually they will.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We simply should sow the seeds into their being and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>One day these seeds will blossom and bear fruit.</S>
