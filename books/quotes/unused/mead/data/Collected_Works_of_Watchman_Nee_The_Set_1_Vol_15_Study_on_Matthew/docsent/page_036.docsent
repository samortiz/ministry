   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Chapter one tells us, on the one hand, that Jesus is Emmanuel, and on the other hand, that He will save His people from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter two the word concerning Jesus being born as the King of the Jews was spoken from the mouths of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter three first it says to the Jews that they should produce fruit worthy of their repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This relates to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then it speaks of how God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This relates to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, it speaks of the Lord's death, that is, the Lord's baptism in the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter four the Lord began His work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapters five through seven cover the requirements of the spiritual kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The end of chapter seven mentions God's will, and the end of chapter twelve also mentions God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter eight the Lord healed first the Jews and then the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then He went back to the Jews to heal Peter's mother-in-law and finally to heal all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter nine tells us that the Lord healed diseases and cast out demons, yet He was accused of casting out demons by the ruler of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The rejection of the Lord by the people had begun.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter ten the Lord still sent His disciples to the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the final call for them to go out to gain a remnant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter eleven we see a remnant which is the result of the work in chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the end of chapter twelve the Lord declared that from then on He cut off His relationship with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, that was only a doctrinal declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The formal declaration would be made at the end of chapter twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The teachings after chapter thirteen are not related very much to the Jews; rather, they are directed toward the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 25: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here in this verse, all those people mentioned earlier in the chapter were put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A remnant is here.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord showed us that all those who desire to have the truth concerning the kingdom of the heavens are infants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The wise and intelligent here are not truly wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, they are in contrast to the infants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we have a principle: if we read the Bible yet do not understand what we read, it is not because our mind is not good but because our mind is too good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our mind is not good, it is because our heart is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every time we fail to understand the Bible when we read, it is because we do not have the attitude of an infant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our judgment is of God, we will not be afraid to read it once more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 26:"Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who were these infants?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were the remnant gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although almost all rejected Him and only a small number, a remnant, followed Him, that was sufficient for Him, for that was well-pleasing in God's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>M. E. Barber once said something to this effect: "If the Lord desires to imprison me for twenty years, I am willing, though I came to China to save people." The Lord's being a perfect Servant does not depend on the result of His work but on His doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 27:"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"All things" refers to people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From John 6:65 we can see that every saved one is given by God to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everyone who comes to the Lord is moved by God John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this verse we know that no one knows the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the Lord was misunderstood by men, He was satisfied as long as He was known by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The life of the Lord can be divided into three sections: 1 from the manger to the Jordan River, 2 from the Jordan River to the Mount of Transfiguration, and 3 from the Mount of Transfiguration to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By reading Hebrews 10:7 we can see that the purpose of the Lord's entire life was to die, that is, to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Herein lies the particular point concerning Christ and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is, Christ had only One who knew Him, and that was the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Love is single and also hidden; otherwise, it cannot be considered love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one can come to the Father; only He who knows the Father can reveal the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 28:"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord did not say "all who sin."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What does it mean to toil and be burdened?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This refers in particular to the lost sheep in the house of Israel, who could not obtain their satisfaction from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the other aspect of salvation, that is, the aspect of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Toiling is brought forth by sin, as with those who burn incense and bow down every few steps.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Jews fast twice a week; the Hindus sleep on beds of nails.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are toilings brought forth by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To "come" is our duty; the rest is done by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not have to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 29:"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that we, the rebellious ones, will find rest by turning to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The "rest" in the preceding verse is the rest from sin; the "rest" here is the rest that we need to find because of our heart's disobedience to God, that is, the rest that we have by coming out from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 30:"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we obey, we will feel that His yoke is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The yoke is difficult only because we do not surrender inwardly.</S>
