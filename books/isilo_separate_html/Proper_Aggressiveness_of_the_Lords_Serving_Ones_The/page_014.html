AND EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</h2>
<p>All the co-workers and elders should participate in the small groups and help the group meetings. Especially since we are at the initial stage of the work, we must have a strong beginning. Furthermore, when the co-workers go to help the saints, it is important to have a strong spirit, be &ldquo;thick-skinned,&rdquo; and not have any opinions. We must learn to practice these three things. We want every brother and sister to eventually be a prophet and a teacher. We must go against the way of Christianity, which is to annul the gifts and function of the saints by focusing on one pastor who does everything. This is not according to the Bible. However, we must admit that even though there is much light among us, our practice is not strong. I believe it is the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure that every brother and sister have a turn and function. We hope that after meeting in this way for half a year to one year, every brother and sister will be able to speak, that is, to function as a prophet and a teacher. Everything depends on our endeavoring.</p>
<p>If during 1985 there is a onefold increase in Taipei or, better yet, a twofold increase, there will be more than one thousand small groups, and this will require the help of more than a thousand full-timers. Therefore, it is likely that in the future we will need all the part-time serving ones to help. In addition, some of the brothers and sisters currently meeting in the small groups can help. In a strong local church every brother and sister is useful and capable of going out to battle and of functioning as a prophet and a teacher. When he opens his mouth, his spirit is released, and he is thick-skinned, that is, not self-conscious. Moreover, he does not have any opinions, and will not cause disputes or engage in arguments with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALWAYS HAVING LIGHT FROM THE TRUTH<br />
AND THE SUPPLY OF LIFE<br />
IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>I believe that this demonstration has given us an impression. When we participate in the small group gatherings, we should not forget the impression that we have received. This should be a model. We should forsake idle talk, concentrate on reading the Bible, and be familiar with the footnotes. However, in the meetings we should not read the footnotes in a rigid way; it is sufficient to read only the main points. Nor is it necessary to read every paragraph in a Life-study message. If we prepare before the meeting, we can select portions. This will save time in the meeting and help everyone focus. If too many points are touched in one meeting, everyone&rsquo;s attention will dissipate. In every meeting we must learn to bring the saints into the light in the truth and the life supply so that the brothers and sisters are fed when they leave.</p>
<p>This kind of fellowship in the small groups must take place at least every other week, and the other meetings in the small groups can be used to preach the gospel. It would be quite substantial if in twenty-six gatherings a year the light from the truth is released and life is supplied. In the meetings we must be filled in spirit. Those of us who have more growth in life must bear the responsibility to pray and be filled with a praying spirit. As soon as the meeting begins, our spirit should come forth. Basketball is a good example. You cannot be courteous when the ball comes. Rather, you should forget your self-consciousness, your face, and everything else, and concentrate on the ball and getting it into the hoop. The focus is on scoring points. It is the same in a small group meeting. As soon as we arrive at the meeting, we should forget about everything else and only remember our spirit. Our spirit is the ball. We should also remember to release the light in the truth and to supply the riches of life. Our goal is for every attendant, including ourselves, to be enlightened and supplied.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
