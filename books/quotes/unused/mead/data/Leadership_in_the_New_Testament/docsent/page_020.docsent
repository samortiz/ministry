   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable to live in. Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord's recovery saying that there is no delegated authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to this teaching Brother Nee was wrong in his book Authority and Submission.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If Brother Nee was wrong, the Bible is also wrong because the Bible strongly reveals God's delegated authority in the church life and in the ministry.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul exercised his authority in his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He taught the same thing everywhere in every church 1 Cor 4:17b , and the churches followed his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was the demonstration of Paul's delegated authority.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The leadership in the ministry was in the leading ones' dealing with the problems and affairs of the churches 1 Cor 1:10; 5:11-13; 11:34b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul was strong in dealing with the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians 4:21 he said, "What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Should I come to you with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 11:34 he said, "And the rest I will set in order when I come."</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The leadership in the ministry was also in the appointing of and dealing with the elders Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim 5:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Timothy 5:19-20 shows that not only did the apostles have the authority to appoint the elders, but they also had the authority to judge them, including the authority to remove them.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is like the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3.</S>
