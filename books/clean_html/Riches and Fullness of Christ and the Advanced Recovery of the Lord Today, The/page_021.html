<h2 class=head2>The Condition for Prophesying—Every Morning Being Revived to Live Always in the Spirit</h2><p>Lastly, I want to speak concerning the qualification for prophesying. First, one must be a revived person. To have a revival once is not enough; every morning we need a revival. This is like the sun that rises once every twenty-four hours. Once the sun rises, we have morning, and we should rise with the rising of the sun. Proverbs says, “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day’’ (4:18). The book of Judges also says, “Let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might’’ (5:31). This tells us that every day we should have a morning that rises up. The Lord also tells us in Lamentations that His mercies are new every morning (3:22-23). Hence, between the Lord and us, every morning there should be a new beginning and a new revival. When we are revived in the morning, we can live an overcoming life during the day. If we are revived daily and we are overcoming every day, we will be able to prophesy for the Lord.<p>Second, we need to live always in the spirit and to fellowship with the Lord, being filled and saturated with the Lord’s word, so that we can become one who is full of the Lord’s word. Furthermore, our spirit should always be ready to receive inspiration and revelation at any time. In addition, we should have spiritual discernment; we should not live in darkness and should not be blind or follow others indiscriminately. We need to discern all the situations and all the persons, events, and things that are around us. If you are such a discerning and enlightened person, wherever you go and whichever meeting you are in, you will be able to prophesy.<h2 class=head1>THREE CRUCIAL THINGS IN THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY</h2><h2 class=head2>Visiting People to Preach the Gospel</h2><p>Our old way of preaching the gospel cannot be said to be bad or wrong. However, it is not good enough. For example, when we go out to travel today, do we go by car or by mule-wagon? Although there is nothing wrong with riding on a mule-wagon, and although whatever way we take, we are traveling, this way is too restricted. No one would travel today on a mule-wagon instead of in a car. During the past four years, I have spoken about preaching the gospel by visiting people through knocking on their doors. Some think that, although we can preach the gospel by knocking on doors, we can also preach the gospel by ways other than knocking on doors. I have never said that if we do not knock on doors, we cannot preach the gospel. This would be like saying that if we do not ride in a car, we cannot travel. Nevertheless, there is a great difference between traveling by car and traveling on foot.<p>Which way is more effective, the old way of preaching the gospel, or the present way of visiting people by knocking on doors from house to house? According to our statistics, when we preach the gospel by knocking on doors, we can easily have one saved and baptized out of twenty doors. We do not need to go out to knock on doors every day. As long as we baptize one person a month, that will be enough. We do not need to knock on too many doors. Every one of you can do this. Today, people talk much about childbearing and birth control; with respect to the preaching of the gospel, we should pay attention to these matters.<h2 class=head2>Nourishing Others through the Home Meetings</h2><p>After we have baptized someone, we need to nourish him the next day. Once every two or three days after that, we need to continue going to him. At least we should visit him four times a month. The most important thing for a mother to do once a baby is born is to feed him. If the baby does not have milk for three or five days, he will starve to death. This was the problem among us in the past. The result is that not many people remained. Hence, we should have adequate care for the newly baptized ones.<p>Not only does a mother have to feed a newborn baby with milk, but she has to cherish him as well. When the baby is not comfortable and is crying, she has to rock him back and forth in her arms so that the child will feel comfortable. This is the cherishing. When a new one is saved, what follows is the care. Moreover, we must care for new ones in their homes rather than asking them to come to the meeting. This is the home meeting. Of course, the new ones cannot stay in their homes forever. After a while, they need to be brought to the group meetings and the church meetings.
