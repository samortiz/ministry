   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Receive Christ as Their Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The father's response to his son is seen in verses 22 through 24.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And they began to be merry."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The son came back as a poor, pitiful prodigal, but the father gave him three things: a robe, a ring, and sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The father clothed his son with the best robe to cover him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This robe signifies Christ as our righteousness for our justification Jer 23:6; 1 Cor 1:30; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isa 61:10; Zech 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ring signifies the sealing Spirit as the God-given seal upon the accepted believer Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone is wearing a gold ring, he must have a lot of money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ring on the son's finger was a mark that he had become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sandals signify the power of God's salvation to separate the believers from the dirty earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now he was no longer a poor prodigal, but a rich young man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was now qualified to enter the father's house, but he needed something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had been eating the carob pods which the hogs were eating Luke 15:16 and he had walked quite a distance to his father's house without eating anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was clothed with a robe, marked with a ring, and separated from the earth with a pair of shoes, but his stomach surely was crying out for food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So the father told his slaves to kill the fattened calf for his son's enjoyment v. 23 . This signifies the rich Christ Eph 3:8 , killed on the cross for the believers' enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we are justified by God with Christ, we receive Christ as our satisfaction, as our supply, as the fattened calf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Christ here is first a robe and then the fattened calf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In resurrection He has become our food, our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the result of the seeking and convicting of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seeking and convicting of the Spirit issue in our obedience, in our repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we receive Christ outwardly as our righteousness and inwardly as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the sanctification of the Spirit, the first step of God's salvation.</S>
