   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE ESSENCE OF HIS ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the past years, it has been difficult for me to understand what the image of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I studied this verse years ago, I asked, "How could the invisible God have an image?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To me an image must be visible; but I wondered how the invisible God could have a visible image.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I had no one to help me find the answer to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But through more than fifty years of study I have gained a better understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The image of God is just the form of God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has many attributes, and God's inward being is the totality of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An attribute is an element that belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, power, might, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These and hundreds of other items are the elements that belong to God; hence, they are His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When these attributes are expressed, they become virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Peter 2:9 says that we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here Peter used the word virtues instead of attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Virtues are the expressed attributes, and attributes are the hidden or concealed virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Christ lived on this earth, He expressed God's attributes in His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He expressed the divine attributes in His humanity as virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the divine attributes have an image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This image is Christ the Son as the expression of the invisible God in the essence of His attributes 2 Cor 4:4b; Col 1:15a .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST HAVING THE FORM OF GOD'S BEING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man was created after the likeness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's likeness is the form of God's being Phil 2:6 , the expression of the essence and nature of God's person Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past I thought that the likeness referred to God's outward expression, and I told people that in the Old Testament, before He was incarnated, God had man's likeness already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this understanding is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The likeness is the form of God's being, which is the expression of the essence and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the likeness is very close to the image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Philippians 2:5-8 the words form, likeness, and fashion are used.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses say, "...Christ Jesus, who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man..."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before His incarnation, Christ existed in the form of God, but when He became incarnated, He put the divine form aside outwardly and took on the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The form of God mentioned in these verses is the expression, not the fashion, of God's being Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is identified with the essence and nature of God's person and, hence, expresses them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This refers to Christ's deity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The form of God Phil 2:6 implies the inward reality of Christ's deity; the likeness of men v. 7 denotes the outward appearance of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He appeared to men as a man outwardly, but as God He had the reality of deity inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word fashion in verse 8 refers to the outward guise, the semblance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a repetition in a more particular sense of the thought of likeness in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of God's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The effulgence of God's glory is like the shining or the brightness of the light of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son is the shining, the brightness, of the Father's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This refers to God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The impress of God's substance is like the impress of a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son is the expression of what God the Father is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This refers to God's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I have a seal containing my name and some sealing ink, when I put the seal on a piece of paper, an impress will be left on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God Himself is the seal, and Christ is the impress, the expression, of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man was made in God's image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God created man in such a way as a preparation for His dispensing of Himself into man for the fulfillment of His divine economy, His divine plan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man was created in the image and likeness of God so that he can express God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man is a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A photograph taken of a certain person is for expression.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the same way, man was created for God's expression.</S>
