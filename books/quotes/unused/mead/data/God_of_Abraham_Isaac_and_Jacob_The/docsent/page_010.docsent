   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament there was a nation, Israel, because God wanted a people on this earth, that is, He wanted a group of people who were separated unto God, who were for His glory, and who belonged to Him.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's purpose in choosing a people is for them to become His testimony on the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever there are God's people, there is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rabshakeh, a general of the king of Assyria, the enemy of the children of Israel, said, "Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?...Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 Kings 18:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows us that before the enemies of the Israelites could deal with the Israelites, they had to first deal with Jehovah because the Israelites were one with Jehovah.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am the Lord's."</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said, "Everyone who confesses in Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before the angels of God; but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God" Luke 12:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord wants to gain men who will confess His name.</S>
