   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 From Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 4 reveals that the believers have been freed from law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 4 and 5 say, When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s chosen people were shut up by law under its custody Gal 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was born under law in order to redeem them from its custody that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, they should not return to the custody of law to be under its slavery, but should remain in the sonship of God to enjoy the life supply of the Spirit in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, God s economy is to produce sons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ s redemption brings us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not God s economy to make us keepers of law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression Heb 2:10; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship Eph 1:5 and regenerated us to be His sons John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we should remain in His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not be distracted by the appreciation of law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Romans 6:14 Paul tells us, You are not under law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in 7:1-6 he goes on to explain how we are not under law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 6 says, Now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the law was given to the old man Rom 6:6 , who is the old husband, 7:2-3 and because the old man died on the cross, we are discharged from his law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why we are no longer under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4 From the Bondage of Law</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As believers in Christ, we are free not only from law but also from the bondage of law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is clearly revealed in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Galatians 5:1 says, For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore and do not be again entangled with a yoke of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This charge is based on the revelation presented in chapters one through four, where Paul speaks of slavery under the law and of how Christ has delivered us from that slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The freedom in 5:1 denotes freedom from the slavery of law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ has set us free through His redeeming death and life-imparting resurrection that we may enjoy this freedom and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To stand fast is to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christ has set us free for freedom, we should stand fast and not be entangled again with the yoke of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Galatians 4:7 Paul says, You are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament believer is no longer a slave to works under law, but is a son in life under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of the law to keep us in custody, we have the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Spirit is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whereas the law could not give life, the Spirit gives life and brings us into maturity that we may have the full position and right of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The custody of the law has been replaced by the Spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Galatians 5:13 says, You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not turn the freedom into an occasion for the flesh, but through love serve one another as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see Paul s balance in the matter of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we are free from the yoke of slavery, from the law; on the other hand, we should not use this freedom for an occasion for the flesh, but should care for others and serve them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Galatians 2:4 Paul speaks of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such strong negative terms as false brothers, stole in, and spy out should impress us with the fact that freedom in Christ is a great and precious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Freedom in Christ has at least four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, freedom in Christ implies liberation from obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we are free in Christ, we are no longer obligated to the law and its ordinances, practices, and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, freedom in Christ includes satisfaction with a rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are free outwardly but do not have anything to support us or satisfy us, this freedom is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Real freedom is not only liberation from obligation but also full satisfaction with an abundant supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Third, to be free in Christ is to enjoy rest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fourth, freedom in Christ implies the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we are free in Him, we enjoy all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, freedom in Christ involves liberation from obligation, satisfaction through the Lord s rich supply, genuine rest, and the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because those who have this kind of freedom are free in the depths of their being, they are released from the bondage of law.</S>
