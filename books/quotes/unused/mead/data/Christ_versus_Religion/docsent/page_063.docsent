   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But after Matthew 28, we come to John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their high didn't last very long; they came down from the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I must confess that I like John 21 much better than Matthew 28, because according to my experience I am not always so high.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times I am not in Matthew 28, but John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 28 we have a mountain, while in John 21 we have the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where are you in your experience now on the mountain or on the seashore?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are honest, most of you will admit that you are presently on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seashore in John 21 was not so good; it was not the place appointed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord appointed a mountain, not the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sea was a place to which the disciples backslid.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter took the lead, and they all went to the sea it was their choice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fishing in John 21 does not have positive significance, but negative.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have come to this country just to make a living, if you are in any place merely for your living, that is the fishing mentioned in John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You don't care for the Lord's commission; you only care for your living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord commissioned you in Matthew 28, but you couldn't stand the test, you gave up His commission to care for your living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You said like Peter, "I go a fishing."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For people to make a living is according to the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God created man, and man must live; so God has prepared the things for man's living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To make a living is all right; but as a child of God, a disciple of Jesus commissioned with His authority, we should not be here for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are you?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be here for the Lord's commission in Matthew 28.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must not be here for fishing, but for "churching."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have already seen how the disciples fished through the entire night and caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then when morning came, the Lord Jesus was there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Matthew on the mountaintop, the disciples were waiting for the Lord, but here on the seashore the Lord Jesus was waiting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do believe that when Peter and the others went to the sea, the Lord was there already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was always with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether they were in a building or in the open air, whether they were on the mountaintop or at the seashore, wherever they were, He was there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they were casting the net, He was there also.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In fact, He was managing the situation so that they caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not under their hand, but Jesus'.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And then He manifested Himself to them and showed that He had the food prepared and it was already cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do mean business that we are here for the Lord's commission, the Lord will take care of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone may be jobless, but we will still have bread.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People today are so greatly concerned about the unemployment problem, but we may forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That has nothing to do with us; we are not here for making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether fish can be caught or not, we don't depend on the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We depend on the living Christ; He has all the fish in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The worldly people do not have Christ; they must depend on the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But not us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are one who is for the world, you must be concerned for your living, you must put your trust in your employment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if you are one of the disciples commissioned by the Lord Jesus, forget about your living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just be honest and faithful to His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You will even save your cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord said, "Come and dine."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don't worry about eating He will take care of that.</S>
