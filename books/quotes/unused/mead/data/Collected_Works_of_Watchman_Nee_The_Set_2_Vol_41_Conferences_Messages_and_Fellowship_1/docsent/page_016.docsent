   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of Brother Nee's Letter to John Wang</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Yesterday I was praying singlemindedly and searching my heart day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I felt that your attitude and motive were very questionable referring to what John Wang did when he was in Shanghai .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the few conversations I had with you, I felt that the difference between us still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From this night forward, the arguments between us should end right here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can take your way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I guarantee you that I will not bother you anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the meeting in Foochow in She-Er-Jen-Pai , I cannot render any help to the situation, and neither will I do anything to damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I admit that you have won your arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in your conversation with a certain sister last night about forcing others to take off their head covering, I am afraid that you overstepped in the matter of exercising your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mr. Panton said that over-law is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your exercise of authority is for achieving your private end."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Nee's Declaration at 7 p.m. on August 31 at the Lawn Close to Sister Chia's House</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From tonight on, I will officially withdraw my declaration concerning the meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John Wang is playing with our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have urged John to settle the issue of head covering with a certain sister, but John argued that the sister was being disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some sisters who were dissatisfied with the meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai urged John Wang to settle the issue of the head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John told my mother Brother Nee's mother that he was reluctant to get involved in the dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet at the same time that he said this, he also told the sisters to submit and take off their head coverings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Weigh Asked concerning</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What Should Be Done in the Event That</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There Was a Separation from She-Er-Jen-Pai</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee's answer: First, after you go down from the mountain here, you should talk the problem over with the brothers in She-Er-Jen-Pai just by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, after attending one meeting, you should again ask them what attitude they will adopt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, you should stop attending their meeting temporarily if they will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can gather some people to meet with you on the Lord's Day or have prayer meetings or Bible study meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fourth, you should write an open letter to all the brothers and sisters in She-Er-Jen-Pai and explain the whole story concerning the dispute with the matter of the head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fifth, before you stop attending their meetings, you should write a letter to the responsible ones in She-Er-Jen-Pai.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tell them that you are waiting for them to settle the issue, that you feel that their attitude is wrong, and that they have abused their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Two Reasons for Excommunication</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>from Foochow in 1924</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was excommunicated in Foochow in 1924 for two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, I opposed inviting Mr. Woodberry from the Christian and Missionary Alliance to ordain some of us to be pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, I opposed putting up a sign that said "The Foochow Church."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, the brothers tried to change the name to "The Chuan-Chien-Shan Church."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Chuan-Chien-Shan is the name of a district in the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I opposed it because such names cannot include all the believers in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, there are various Chinese Associations in the city of San Francisco, each affiliated with a different province.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is constant fighting among them, sometimes even with firearms.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose a few Chinese among them put up another sign that just said "The Chinese Association."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This sign would be torn down immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They can only claim to represent all the Chinese in San Francisco when all the Chinese in the different associations have become one in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, under the present circumstance, a few of them who are of one mind can still bind themselves together and have an unofficial Chinese Association that does not bear an official name and which includes all Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such an association would be standing on the ground of the Chinese Association, but would not declare anything in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our practice of the local church should be the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there is absolutely no other denomination in a locality, an assembly can declare itself to be the local church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If any denomination comes afterward to set up another congregation, it is setting up a division.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The one who is there first has the right of priority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In a place where there are existing denominations already, one can only say that his meeting is one that meets in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The words church and assembly are the same in Greek, which is ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the above two issues were raised on one Lord's Day morning, I spoke on the subject of the way of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Old Testament, after the ark was separated from the tabernacle, the center of worship followed the movement of the ark; the tabernacle became a useless form.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The same is true in principle with our assembly today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is crucial is not the outward tabernacle, which typifies formal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What counts is the testimony of Christ within, which is typified by the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We follow the ark, not the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After the ark and the tabernacle were separated, God's eyes only rested on the ark, not on the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who have acquired wisdom as Solomon did should run to the ark and no longer care for the tabernacle 1 Kings 3:4-15 .</S>
