   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HAVING NO AMBITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to our experiences over the past years, ambition has been the source of all the problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ambition leads to power struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The source of ambition is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His ambition is to rise above God and His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan was cast down and judged because of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, you can see power struggles everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You see it among your friends.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once you try to rise above others to have authority over others, you will create problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not mean that there should not be authority in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The foregoing lessons have already described the matter of authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more life of God one has, the more authority he has.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Authority does not come by struggling, back-biting, or arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It comes from God and it comes with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How then can Satan rise above God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is Satanic ambition without the capacity to exercise the proper authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord humbled and emptied Himself to be a slave unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How about us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul said that we should let the mind of Christ be in us Phil 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would do this, there will never be any Satanic ambition in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, we will always serve as a slave in the church life to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Questions How does the "consciousness of life'' deliver us from division?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you visit with the brothers and sisters can you discern the difference between fellowship and chit-chat?</S>
