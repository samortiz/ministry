<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ENTREATED TO RESPOND AND ENCOURAGED<br>
WITH THE PASSING AWAY OF THE WINTER<br>
AND THE COMING OF THE SPRING OF RESURRECTION<br>
IN ITS FLOURISHING RICHES</H2>

<P>In verses 10 through 13 the lover is entreated to respond and is encouraged with the passing away of the winter and the coming of the spring of resurrection in its flourishing riches. The Beloved entreated His lover to come out from behind the wall.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Lover of Christ<br>
Failing to Respond to Him in His Fellowship</H2>

<P>"My beloved responds and says to me" in verse 10a indicates that the lover of Christ failed to respond to Him in His fellowship. If the lover had given a proper response, it would not have been necessary for the Beloved to speak again.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. She Being Down in Her Situation</H2>

<P>"Rise up, my love" (v. 10b) indicates that she was down in her situation, so Christ asked her in love to rise up. Whenever we have some attainment in spiritual seeking, the result is a down situation. Such a situation is mainly due to the self and introspection.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ Wanting Her to Come Out<br>
of Her Down Situation to Be with Him</H2>

<P>The words "My beauty, and come away" (v. 10c) indicate that Christ in His appreciation of her wanted her to come out of her down situation to be with Him. This is a word of encouragement.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Time of Dormancy and Trials Being Over</H2>

<P>"Now the winter is past;/The rain is over and gone" (v. 11). This indicates that the time of dormancy (winter) and trials (rain) is over and that the time of spring (resurrection) is coming.</P>
