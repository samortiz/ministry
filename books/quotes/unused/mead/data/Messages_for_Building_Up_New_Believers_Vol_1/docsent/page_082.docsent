   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example 2: Hymns, #578 My will is weak, my strength is frail,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And all my hope is nearly gone;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can but trust Thy working true</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To gently hold and lead me on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I ve tried my best, but still have failed,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>E en as before I ve failed and erred;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thy patience is my only trust</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To hold and keep me to Thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whene er my heart is lifted up,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How very near I am to fall;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I dare not do, I dare not think,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I need Thyself in great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Though I m the weakest of the weak,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My strength is nothing but Thy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a good hymn directed toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My will is weak, my strength is frail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Inwardly the will is weak, while outwardly the strength is frail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Inwardly one wants to will, but he is too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Outwardly he wants to do something, but he is too frail.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He can neither will nor run.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus all my hope is nearly gone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What else can he do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He can only trust Thy working true.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At first the writer was talking to himself, but now he turns to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He comes to God and looks to Him to gently hold and lead me on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that other than the Lord s gentle step-by-step leading, he now has no more hope.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is where he stands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Following this, we have the next line: I ve tried my best, but still have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not preaching; this is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E en as before I ve failed and erred.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thy patience is my only trust.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He trusts in the Lord s patience to do what?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To hold and keep me to Thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has no other hope.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His only hope is in the Lord s power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is His power that holds and keeps him in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He sees himself as being completely hopeless; he is clear about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the third stanza, we see a man of God climbing slowly upward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whene er my heart is lifted up this means whenever he is slightly proud and self-appreciating only very slightly How very near I am to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has had too much of such experiences already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should he do now?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I dare not do, I dare not think.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He dares not do anything; he even dares not think anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I need Thyself in great or small this means that he needs the Lord in everything and in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here is a person whose sentiments have thoroughly passed through the refining fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not harsh before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every word is poetry and full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every word touches God and God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, a person who knows himself does not remain in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, he has to pray to God, Thou art my Savior, strength and stay, / O Lord, I come to seek Thy face.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have no way, no hope, nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can only come to seek after You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Though I m the weakest of the weak here he refers back to stanza one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not end abruptly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My will is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>My strength is frail.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I cannot will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I cannot run.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am the weakest of the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>My strength is nothing but Thy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord s grace is all that he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is this grace that enables him to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our feelings are tested and refined, every time we come to God and touch such a divinely tested and refined hymn, our feeling cannot help but be caught up in it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Example 3: Hymns, #377 If the path I travel</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Lead me to the cross,</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the way Thou choosest</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Lead to pain and loss,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let the compensation</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Daily, hourly, be</S>

   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Let the spirit praise Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Though the heart be riven;</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If sweet earthly ties, Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Break at Thy decree,</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let the tie that binds us,</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Closer, sweeter, be.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Lonely though the pathway,</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Cheer it with Thy smile;</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Be Thou my companion</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Through earth s little while;</S>

   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Everything about it belongs to a higher realm and is lofty and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is rare for a hymn on fellowship to reach such a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There is not a tint of unnaturalness or extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is a genuine expression of a genuine lover of the Lord toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is perfect submission borne out of perfect consecration.</S>

   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If the path I travel / Lead me to the cross, / If the way Thou choosest / Lead to pain and loss, / Let the compensation / Daily, hourly, be / Shadowless communion, / Blessed Lord, with Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is full of consecration and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Stanza two is the best stanza in the whole hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Here the feeling ascends still higher.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If there s less of earth joy the writer is contemplating Give, Lord, more of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He is praying to God, not for deliverance or for change, but for more fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riven.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Here is a person who can differentiate between the heart and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The heart may be broken, but the spirit can praise.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The heart may be riven, but the spirit is still fresh before God.</S>
