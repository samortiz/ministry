   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see the definite steps needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may agree with the new way, but this does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must also exercise and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Elders' Leadership and Stirring-up Action</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first definite step needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel depends on the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The elders in every local church should exercise their leadership in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the New Testament priests of the gospel, they have to preach the gospel, and they have to stir up a gospel preaching atmosphere in their local church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elders must take the lead to create such an atmosphere so that their church can be a gospel preaching church according to God's ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the elders need to forget about the old way and pick up the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They should go out by themselves to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The saints need to make a determination and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must all make a strong determination that we will practice our God-given New Testament priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of our determination, we have to consecrate ourselves, to present our bodies as living sacrifices to God Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best way to exercise and to practice is to preach the gospel to our close relatives to our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. By doing this we will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praying and Being Revived</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we have to pray desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our prayer, the Lord will shine over us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will be exposed under His shining, and we will see all our failures, defects, and imperfections.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can then make a thorough confession and be revived by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not remain in our present passive situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be aggressive and take the initiative in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Going to Visit Sinners on Definite Days</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must set aside a certain day and time each week and only use it for our priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not say that we have no time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as we have time to do other things, we surely have time to visit sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Exercising Persistence, Patience, and Faith</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we must exercise persistence, patience, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not gain anyone in one year, we must thank the Lord that He has given us another year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be persistent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We still have to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we speak Christ to others week after week, we will surely gain someone.</S>
