In Spirit</h2><p>Verse 5 says that the mystery has been revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit. The word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God. It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit. Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is unveiled to the apostles and prophets. We need the same spirit to see such a revelation.</p><p>When we speak to others about Christ and the church, we should not speak from our mind, emotion, or will. Rather, from our spirit we should tell others what we have experienced of Christ and the church. The principle here is that emotion touches emotion, mind touches mind, and will touches will. Likewise, only spirit can contact spirit. If you speak to others from your emotion, you will not be able to touch their spirit. But if you speak out from your spirit, their spirit will be touched.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Concerning Christ and the Church</h2><p>The revelation received by the apostles and prophets is not a revelation of the many secondary matters in the Bible. It is the revelation concerning Christ and the church. In order to dispense Christ to others, we need to have this revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2><p>In 3:4 Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ. The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 (Gk.) is Christ, whereas the mystery of Christ here is the church. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Hidden in Other Generations<br />but Revealed in the New Testament Age</h2><p>This mystery was hidden in other generations, but has been revealed in the New Testament age. The mystery of Christ, the church, which is His Body, was hidden in the Old Testament ages. None of the Old Testament saints knew anything regarding this mystery. But it is revealed in the New Testament to all believers through the apostles and prophets. Today our ministry is simply to carry on this revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Church, the Body of Christ</h2><h2 class="head3">1. With the Nations as Joint-heirs<br />and Joint-partakers of the Promise</h2><p>We have pointed out that the mystery of Christ is the church, which is the Body of Christ. Regarding the church as the mystery of Christ, verse 6 says that &ldquo;the nations are to be joint-heirs and a joint Body and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;joint-heirs&rdquo; indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the nations, the chosen and redeemed Gentiles, are joined with the believing Jews to be the heirs of God, inheriting God. The term &ldquo;joint Body&rdquo; indicates that the saved Gentiles are joined with the saved Jews to be the one Body of Christ for His unique expression. The term &ldquo;joint-partakers&rdquo; indicates that the Gentile believers are joined with the Jewish believers to partake of God&rsquo;s promises given in the Old Testament concerning all the blessings of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Joint-heirs are related to the blessing of the household of God; a joint Body is related to the blessing of the Body of Christ; and the joint-partakers are related to the blessing of the promises of God, as found in Genesis 3:15; 12:3; 22:18; 28:14; and Isaiah 9:6. Both the blessing of God&rsquo;s household and the blessing of Christ&rsquo;s Body are particular, whereas the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise is general, all-inclusive.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Brought Forth out of<br />the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2><p>The church as the Body of Christ is brought forth out of the unsearchable riches of Christ (3:8). The church is not brought forth out of doctrines or systems of organization. As the Body of Christ, the church can only be brought forth out of the riches of what Christ is.</p><h2 class="head3">3. For Expressing<br />the Multifarious Wisdom of God<br />to the Rulers and Authorities in the Heavenlies</h2><p>According to God&rsquo;s intention, the church is to express His multifarious wisdom to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies (3:10). This is to shame Satan and his followers. Satan&rsquo;s plots afford God the opportunity to express His wisdom in a multifarious way through the church.</p><h2 class="head3">4. According to the Eternal Purpose<br />Which God Made in Christ</h2><p>The producing of the church to be the Body of Christ is according to the eternal purpose which God made in Christ in eternity past (3:11). The formation of the church is not accidental, but eternally planned.</p><h2 class="head3">5. For the Dispensation of God</h2><p>God&rsquo;s purpose in having the church is to dispense Himself into His chosen people (3:9). Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is the dispensation of God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> </body></html>
