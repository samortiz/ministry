	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">MAJOR GROUPS WITHIN CHRISTIANITY</h1>
<p>During the process in which the church became the Roman Catholic Church, strong distinctions developed among the various groups within the church. The transmutation of the organization of the church began from when Bishop Clement suggested that the system of the Jewish priesthood be brought into the church. Once the transmutation started, those in the church who lived before the Lord began to differ from the majority in their thought. Those who went along with the transmutation gained more and more power, while those who stood against the transmutation became small and hidden before God; they lived before God, serving Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>Those who accepted the transmuted organization of the church organized themselves into the catholic church in approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage in northern Africa. The catholic church united all the churches in the world, and the word <em>catholic</em> is still used by the Roman Catholic Church to indicate that the entire world is unified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURE IN HEART</h2>
<p>Many people who lived before the Lord separated themselves from the catholic church. Although there were sects within the church, there were no major divisions. However, after the catholic church was formed, the sectarianism within the church was clearly manifested, and two lines developed within Christianity. The catholic church, because of its organization and methods, was easily utilized by the Roman government. Thus, the catholic church continually gained status and power.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who stood apart from the catholic church had a pure heart for the Lord. They rejected the world to follow the Lord in a simple way and to live a pure life before Him. Their stand for the Lord distinguished them not only from those in the catholic church but also from most people in society; therefore, these pure-hearted believers were not welcomed by human society, and history records very little concerning them. These hidden people lived before the Lord, did not announce themselves to outsiders, and did not live according to the fashion of the day. This made them unwelcome in society, and few people paid attention to them. Secular historians naturally ignored them.</p>
<p>Because most early church historians were members of the Roman Catholic Church, they did not mention those who served the Lord out of a pure heart. The Roman Catholic Church tried to destroy any books written by those who were pure in heart; therefore, few records have been left to us by the pure-hearted ones. However, from the little we have, it is clear that they testified boldly for the Lord even though the Roman Catholic Church frustrated and persecuted them. After that there were two major groups within Christianity&mdash;the high-class, powerful Roman Catholic Church and the lowly, hidden, pure-hearted believers.</p>
<p>When Constantine came to power, he united Christianity with the Roman government. This union was with the so-called catholic church; at that time no other organization or group could match the splendor and power of the catholic church. Later, even the emperors had to kneel before the archbishops and kiss their hands in a gesture of respect and honor. This shows that the catholic church was highly respected.</p>
<p>In such a situation the believers who were pure in heart were troubled both by the Roman government and the catholic church. In general, the Roman government at that time was not opposed to Christianity; on the contrary, it welcomed Christianity. However, the Roman government troubled the pure-hearted Christians because it was united with the catholic church. Although the Roman government could influence the catholic church, the catholic church could also influence the government. Because the catholic church was against the pure-hearted believers, the Roman government stood with the catholic church and followed it to oppose them.</p>
<p>Thus, although the Roman government accepted Christianity, which it had formerly opposed, its acceptance was conditional. They welcomed the Christians who were in the catholic church but not those who were pure in heart. Therefore, the two groups of Christians were clearly divided. One group was the unified catholic church with its rigid organizational system, and the other group consisted of scattered believers without any organization, those who were pure in heart. This separation was primarily in the matter of organization. In the organization of the catholic church, the patriarchs were in the highest position. The position of the pope developed out of the patriarchal system. Originally, there were five patriarchs, one in Rome in the West and four in the East&mdash;in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. The four patriarchs in the East took the patriarch of Constantinople as their head; each patriarch governed an administrative district that was composed of several provinces. The patriarch of Rome had many clergy under him; these clergymen were called cardinals and had the authority to elect the patriarch. These cardinals later became the seven cardinal bishops in the Roman Catholic Church. Each patriarch had several archbishops under him; each archbishop governed an archdiocese. Each diocese had a governing bishop, and in the bishop&rsquo;s absence, the monsignors stood in for him. The monsignors were chief elders who would chair the meetings. Under the monsignors were the deacons, the lowest ones in the hierarchy. This was the organization of the catholic church that tried to unify all the churches on the earth.</p>
<p>However, the pure-hearted believers did not want a unification of the whole earth, and they did not accept the hierarchy. Thus, they began to have their own separate meetings. The catholic church excommunicated the pure-hearted believers, accusing them of preaching heresy. From then on, there were two clear lines among Christians. One line was organized and visible, enjoying a high status in the world; the other line was hidden, without any organization, having been rejected by the world. These two lines have continued to this day.</p>
