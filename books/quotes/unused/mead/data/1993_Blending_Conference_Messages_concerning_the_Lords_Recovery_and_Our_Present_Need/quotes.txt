[1]  CONTENTS The Lord's Recovery The Local Churches The Body of Christ Oneness versus Division The Testimony of Jesus The Life-giving Spirit The Vital Groups PREFACE
[2]  This book is composed of messages given in Anaheim, California on May 28-30, 1993.
[3]  MESSAGE ONE THE LORD'S RECOVERY OUTLINE The Lord's recovery being the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures the holy Word of God 2 Tim 3:16.
[4]  The Lord's recovery of the truths being of two categories: The category of the major items for the eternal economy of God.
[5]  The crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery: The all-inclusive Christ having the preeminence in all things, filling all in all, being the centrality and the universality of God's economy, allotted to the saints as their redemption, life, life-supply, and everything for them to participate in His riches for their enjoyment and be constituted with His divine element that they may become His members to live Him and express Him.
[6]  The consummated Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power, to be the life-giving and indwelling Spirit as the reality, the realization, of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[7]  The church, the called-out assembly, as the house of God composed of all His children and expressed in many localities on the earth as the local churches; and as the universal Body of Christ constituted with Christ as its divine element and composed of all the believers of Christ as its human members in the organic union with Christ in His divine life.
[8]  The term the consummated Spirit implies that the Spirit has been processed and thus has become the consummated Spirit.
[9]  According to the revelation in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, the Spirit of God eventually became the consummated, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit.
[10]  In general, among Christians the eternal life, which is called "everlasting life," has been understood not as a kind of life but as a kind of blissful environment for the believers of Christ to enjoy for eternity in heaven after they die.
[11]  But thank the Lord that in the last seventy years He has recovered among us the scriptural view and the proper realization of the eternal life of God, which we have received of God through our believing in the Son of God, Jesus Christ.
[12]  In this fresh action the Lord has recovered among us in the last seven decades the proper understanding and definition of the eternal life, the genuine understanding of the church of God, the boundary of the local church, the genuine ground of the church, Christ as the overcoming life, Christ as the all-inclusive One who has the preeminence in all things both in God's old creation and in His new creation and who is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy, the church as the Body of Christ, the all-inclusive, compounded, and life-giving Spirit, God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church, the Triune God's dispensing Himself into the tripartite man, the ultimate issue of God's chosen people as the New Jerusalem, the full view and the full definition of the New Jerusalem as God's ultimate manifestation and expression in His mingling with all His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect for eternity, etc. In such a recovery we practice the genuine church, caring for the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, and all the divine truths of reality, not of vain letters, and endeavoring to escape from organization, dogmatic regulations, rituals, the clerical system, and traditions, that we may practice the universal priesthood, the universal function of all the members of Christ in the church life for the building up of the Body of Christ in God's eternal economy.
[13]  The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:3 and the oneness of the divine constitution by the Divine Trinity John 17:21-23 .
[14]  This divine oneness separates all the believers in Christ from the unbelievers and unites all the believers together to be the one Body of Christ.
[15]  According to the New Testament pattern set up and ordained by God and according to the principle of the New Testament revelation concerning God's economy of the church, in each city in which the believers dwell, it is not allowed to have more than one unit as a local expression of the unique Body of Christ, nor is it permitted to have a local church in a certain city without the proper fellowship in the Body of Christ with the other local churches.
[16]  THE MAJOR ITEMS IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY The All-inclusive Christ
[17]  God exalted Him to His right hand Acts 2:33; 5:31 .
[18]  He has the highest place in the universe because He is seated at the right hand of God.
[19]  Colossians 1:17 says that all things subsist together in Christ.
[20]  Now we come to the second crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery, which is the consummated Spirit.
[21]  We need to see what life is and what life does.
[22]  The divine life, the eternal life, can be considered as the first and the basic attribute of God.
[23]  All of these crucial points are part of the completed divine revelation in the holy Scriptures, but through the centuries, they became lost, twisted, and misused.
[24]  Praise the Lord that we are in the Lord's recovery where all these items are being recovered in truth and in practice.
[25]  I am so happy that I am in the Lord's recovery and that the Lord has the way to recover all the deep and precious things in the divine revelation.
[26]  The sixth crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the ground of the church.
[27]  The ground of the church is the oneness of the universal Body of Christ expressed on the ground of each locality of the local churches in which they are located respectively.
[28]  MESSAGE TWO THE LOCAL CHURCHES OUTLINE A local church is the God-called-out people gathered together in a locality a city, a town, or a village.
[29]  All the local churches are the one Body of Christ separated by the localities of their existence, but still expressing the same one Body, not respectively but corporately.
[30]  The local churches are autonomous in business affairs but not in the testimony for Christ and in the fellowship of the Spirit.
[31]  for Christ and in the Fellowship of the Spirit
[32]  Hence, the neighboring local churches should be clustered as much as possible in the blending way for the spiritual benefits in the mutual building up of the Body of Christ, as the Lord Jesus clustered the seven neighboring churches in Asia.
[33]  If all the local churches are one and every local church is in one accord, we will have the blessing.
[34]  We all love the Lord and we are in the Lord's recovery, and we all keep the truth and teach the truth; yet the rate of increase among us is too low.
[35]  Such Clustering Stirring Up the Neighboring Churches in Mutual Love, Mutual Care,
[36]  MESSAGE THREE THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-14, 19-23; 3:8-11; 4:3-6 OUTLINE The Body of Christ is an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[37]  It is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God as its essence, element, and source, mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite believers as the counterpart of the constituting Triune God.
[38]  It is the Body of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ as the fullness, the expression, of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, who fills all in all.
[39]  The Body of Christ is the issue of something.
[40]  The Dispensing of the Triune God In the Father's Nature and Life
[41]  When we Christians come to spiritual things, we mostly would care only for the terms.
[42]  God not only regenerated us but also redeemed us in Christ v. 7 . This means that He rescued us out of the depths of sin, brought us back to Christ, and put us into Christ.
[43]  Verses 13 and 14 are another section which shows us the blessings in the Spirit.
[44]  The final part of Ephesians 1 reveals the transfusing of the ascended Christ vv.
[45]  Ephesians 5 tells us that the Body of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, and this counterpart is the bride, the wife.
[46]  After Adam was created, God said that it was "not good" for Adam to be alone Gen 2:18 .
[47]  The constitution of the Body of Christ is also by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.
[48]  Its Growth and Building Up Being in the Realm of the Genuine Oneness of the Spirit
[49]  We have seen that the church is not an organization, but the Body of Christ, the living organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[50]  As such an organism, the Body of Christ grows and is being built up.
[51]  This is the oneness of the Spirit defined by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 4.
[52]  We need this oneness to be in the realm where the Body of Christ can grow and be built up.
[53]  Without this realm, the Body of Christ is mere terminology.
[54]  MESSAGE FOUR ONENESS VERSUS DIVISION OUTLINE Oneness: The genuine oneness among the believers of Christ is of the Triune God; the real oneness originates from the Triune God; the three of the Divine Trinity are really one among Themselves.
[55]  At the last hour of His course on the earth, after He gave the word on the mysterious Divine Trinity dispensing and transfusing Himself into the believers in John 14 16 right before His betrayal, the Lord prayed to the Father for the oneness among all His believers that it may merge with the genuine oneness of the Divine Trinity.
[56]  On another occasion the Lord charged us to be in harmony when two of us would pray together for anything.
[57]  The apostle charges us to keep the oneness of the Spirit and gives us a clear picture of how the oneness of the Body of Christ is constituted with the Divine Trinity the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence of this inner constitution and of how the Body is the outward vessel to contain the reality of this constituted oneness between the processed Triune God and the transformed believers.
[58]  When Two of Us Would Pray Together for Anything
[59]  At Other Times the Apostles with the Disciples Praised God with One Accord
[60]  At other times the apostles with the disciples praised God with one accord and God's response to them was marvelous, and the heart and soul of the multitude of the believers was one Acts 4:23-32 .
[61]  After Peter and John were threatened by the Sanhedrin and charged not to speak in the name of Jesus, they returned to their own people and reported to them all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
[62]  Verse 5 mentions the one Lord, who is the element of the oneness of the Body.
[63]  In John's Gospel there is the Son for life.
[64]  In Acts 2 the Son in ascension was made both Lord and Christ v. 36 . This is for authority.
[65]  The source of division begins with the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[66]  Divisions damage Christ as the unique One and His Body.
[67]  There Being No Reason and No Excuse for Any Kind of Division and No Justification for It
[68]  Regardless of what the reason is for division, that is not a legitimate reason in the eyes of God.
[69]  MESSAGE FIVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:2, 9; 12:17; 19:10; 20:4b OUTLINE The testimony of Jesus is the spirit the reality, the substance, the disposition, and the characteristic of the prophecy in the book of Revelation Rev 19:10b.
[70]  The testimony of Jesus bears two denotations: A subjective denotation the testimony by Jesus concerning God Rev 1:2; 22:16, 20a: As the true and faithful Witness of God Rev 1:5a; 3:14b , He bears testimony concerning God in what He is and in what He did and what He would do John 5:19; 6:38; 7:16, 18.
[71]  In this message we want to fellowship concerning the testimony of Jesus.
[72]  As the embodiment of God Col 2:9 to express God, Christ manifested God's attributes in His human virtues 1 Tim 3:16 .
[73]  C. The Man-child Born of the Universal Woman
[74]  The bride of the Lamb signifies the totality of all the overcomers throughout the ages Rev 19:7-9 .
[75]  All the overcomers will be a corporate wife married to Christ, and they will become His army.
[76]  Now we need to see the overcomers within the churches Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 .
[77]  If we want to be overcomers within the churches, we need to overcome four "isms": Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism Rev 2:9, 20; 3:1-2, 15-17 .
[78]  Everything we do in our Christian life should be motivated by our love for the Lord.
[79]  It is a serious thing to lose that love, because the Lord warned the church in Ephesus, the church which had left the first love, that if they did not repent, He would remove the lampstand Rev 2:5 .
[80]  Revelation 12 shows us the sign of the man-child born of the universal woman the universal church vv.
[81]  When they are caught up to the heavens, war breaks out.
[82]  Verse 7 says that there was war in heaven.
[83]  The next sign signifying the testimony of Jesus is the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb Rev 14:1-5 .
[84]  The Bible shows us that God is like a farmer growing a crop.
[85]  the Rest of the Seed of the Universal Woman
[86]  The sixth sign of the testimony of Jesus in the book of Revelation is the bride of the Lamb as the aggregate of all the overcomers 19:7-9 .
[87]  In Matthew 22 there was a man who came to the wedding feast.
[88]  He was invited to the wedding feast because he was a real Christian.
[89]  But at the wedding feast this man was approached by the king, who said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?" v. 12 . Because he did not have a wedding garment, that man was cast out into the outer darkness v. 13 . This shows that merely to have Christ as our objective righteousness is not sufficient for us to be qualified to enter into the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into the wedding feast with the Lamb.
[90]  the Wife of the Lamb, as the Ultimate Consummation of All the Matured Saints
[91]  The ultimate testimony of Jesus is the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God, the wife of the Lamb, as the ultimate consummation of all of God's matured people Rev 21:1-3 .
[92]  MESSAGE SIX THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2; Judg.
[93]  6:34; Luke 1:15, 35; Matt 1:20; John 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:2; Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15; Exo 30:23-29; 2 Cor 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27; Acts 16:7; Rom 8:9; Phil 1:19b-21a; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 22:17 OUTLINE He was the Spirit of God in God's creation Gen 1:2.
[94]  In this message we come to the crucial point of the life-giving Spirit.
[95]  The Spirit was first the Spirit of God in God's creation Gen 1:2 .
[96]  The Spirit is also the Lord Spirit for transforming the believers into the glorious image of Christ.
[97]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[98]  The life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit of God, for the believers to put on as their uniform typified by the mantle of Elijah Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15 .
[99]  In the same way, we Christians need to receive daily the Spirit of life as the element and essence of the processed Triune God that we may have a proper life and living essentially, and we also need to put on the uniform of the Spirit of power economically for our work in carrying out God's economy.
[100]  First, the Spirit is the compound Spirit, the compound ointment; then He is the anointing Spirit 2 Cor 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27 .
[101]  THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST FOR HIS BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY IN HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION
[102]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ is for His bountiful supply in His death and resurrection that the believers may live Christ and magnify Christ Phil 1:19b-21a .
[103]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit mentioned in John 7.
[104]  In Revelation 1:4; 4:5; and 5:6 the Spirit is referred to as the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, for the overcomers in the degradation of the church.
[105]  At the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, the churches were degraded.
[106]  In Revelation 1:4-5 the seven Spirits are ranked among the three of the Triune God, showing that the seven Spirits are the Spirit of God in the Divine Trinity.
[107]  MESSAGE SEVEN THE VITAL GROUPS OUTLINE The vital groups cannot be formed by organization.
[108]  A vital group could come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery.
[109]  We need to be stirred up by the Lord so that we can cooperate with Him to go higher.
[110]  The second thing we need is to be vital.
[111]  The second point is that we need to have a thorough confession of our sins, transgressions, defects, wrongdoings, etc. We need to confess the sin of individualism and individuality.
[112]  Praying Unceasingly That They May Be Brought into the Infilling and the Outpouring
[113]  Also, we need to pray unceasingly that we may be brought into the infilling and outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit.
[114]  We need to contact people in the principle of incarnation.
[115]  According to this principle, God and man live together, speak together, and do everything together as one.
[116]  If we contact people in this kind of living way, they will see in us a living expression of the reality of God's New Testament economy.
[117]  We also need to help the new ones to participate in the fellowship of the group meetings.
[118]  This fellowship is the flow of life among the members in the group.
