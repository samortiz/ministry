And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him." Here it clearly says that forgiveness and repentance are both given by God. Man has a wrong concept; he thinks that repentance is something he does, while forgiveness is something God gives. The Bible, however, says that both repentance and forgiveness are given to us by God. He has left nothing for man to do. In preaching the gospel, if someone finds it hard to repent, we can speak of repentance and forgiveness as being one thing. We can tell him that God has given both repentance and forgiveness as gifts. Originally, repentance is a condition for forgiveness. It is good if the Holy Spirit gives man repentance, but if a man cannot repent, we can incorporate repentance under the subject of forgiveness. According to this verse, God gives both things at the same time. He gives repentance at the same time that He gives forgiveness.</p><p>Second Peter 1:1 says, "Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ." Here it says that we have received a faith that is equal to that possessed by other Christians. The entire Bible tells us that the condition for salvation is faith. Here, however, it does not say that we offer our faith to God, but that God offers faith to us. Faith is one of the gifts of God; it is something that we have received from Him. A man is able to believe through the faith he has received from the Holy Spirit. In preaching the gospel, we say that a man must believe before he can be saved. If he cannot believe, however, it is still all right, because faith is an item included in our salvation.</p><p>In Luke 10:25-37 a lawyer asked the Lord, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" The lawyer wanted to know the condition for inheriting eternal life. The Lord told him that to inherit eternal life, he had to love his God and love his neighbor as himself. Here we see that love is a condition for salvation. The lawyer followed this by asking another question: "Who is my neighbor?" The Lord went on with a story in verses 30 through 35, after which He asked, "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?" The Lord intended to show that the lawyer was the very one who had fallen into the hands of the robbers, and that his neighbor, the good Samaritan, was the Lord Jesus Himself. John 4:9 indicates that Samaritans and Jews did not communicate with each other; they had nothing to do with one another. This means that our Lord has no share in the communications of this world. In John 8:48-49 the Jews reviled the Lord as a Samaritan and a demon-possessed person. The Lord denied that He was demon possessed, but He did not deny that He was a Samaritan. This shows us clearly that the good Samaritan refers to the Lord Jesus Himself.</p><p>Luke 10:25-37 is clearly divided into two sections. Verses 25 through 28 are the first section, and verses 29 through 37 are the second section. Loving one's neighbor in order to inherit eternal life is in the first section. The second section tells us that the Savior is the neighbor. He is the One who first loved the sinner. It seems as if inheriting eternal life and loving one's neighbor are all mixed up. Yet this is a glorious fact! On the one hand, when we love Him, we inherit eternal life. On the other hand, He is the One who has loved us and given us eternal life. He must first love us and save us before we can love Him. We cannot love the Lord. Any love that we have towards Him has to come from Him. Eternal life is from Him; so is our love for Him. Salvation is a gift from Him; so is the condition of salvation. Man only needs to believe and receive. Everything is from God. This is the reason that those who have faith can come, and those who do not have faith can also come. Those who want salvation can come, and those who do not want salvation can also come. The Lord is the One who has done everything.</p><p>Read the story in Luke 7:36-48 again. At the end of verse 47, the Lord told Simon that those who are forgiven much love much, and those who are forgiven little love little. This word shows that forgiving comes first and love comes after. It is not that those who love much are forgiven much, but that those who are forgiven much love much. In verse 48 the Lord Jesus told the woman, "Your sins are forgiven." This means that the woman first loved the Lord and then was forgiven. This puts the result of salvation as a condition of salvation. Originally, forgiveness of debt is the content of salvation, while loving the Lord is the result of it. Here, however, the Lord Jesus turns the two around. He tells us that because the woman loved much, all her sins were forgiven. Again the condition for salvation and the result of salvation are mixed up. The forgiving One is the Lord, and the One who caused the woman to love is also the Lord. Salvation is from the Lord, and so is the result of salvation. Here we do not find an order of precedence between the condition for salvation and the result of salvation.</p><p>From the very beginning to the very end, God is the One who accomplishes everything. This is the gospel. God has not only accomplished the work of salvation for us at Golgotha, but He is accomplishing this salvation within us. Both our objective salvation and our subjective salvation are accomplished by the Lord. Luke 8:15 says, "That which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance." We do not have a noble and good heart. Such a heart is made by God (Eccl. 7:29). A sinner cannot be saved unless he first has a noble and good heart. Thank the Lord that He has given us a noble and good heart to receive salvation. God has demands, but He is the One who works to meet the demands. This is the gospel.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
