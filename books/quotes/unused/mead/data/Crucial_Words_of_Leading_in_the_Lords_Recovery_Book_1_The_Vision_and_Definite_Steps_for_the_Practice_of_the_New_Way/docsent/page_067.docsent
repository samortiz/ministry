   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO TEACH TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Lord s Day I go to a different hall to observe the teaching of Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I feel that all the brothers are making progress everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, it seems that we are still not thoroughly clear about how to teach the main points of the lessons, and we do not know the secret of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past I implored that we not expound but only teach the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now I am still holding on to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason is that the content of Truth Lessons is already a complete message which includes everything that should be included.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not require us to expound any further.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we are able to point out and impress people with the main points, this is the best way to teach Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Exercising the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first and foremost requirement in teaching Truth Lessons is the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to exercise our spirit in every word that we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The minute we open our mouth, if we exercise our spirit, we will spontaneously stir up others spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, if we speak in a low tone without any vigor, people will be killed by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, in a classroom full of naughty students, if the teacher speaks without any vigor, the students will be even naughtier and will not listen to the teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though we are not teachers, we still need the same kind of attitude and manner.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we stand on the podium, we should not speak casually or in our regular tone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we need to speak in a dignified way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we open our mouth, our spirit should be released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do this, our teaching of Truth Lessons will be entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we open our mouth, our spirit will come out, and what we are going to say will also be spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The attendants will also exercise their spirit when they speak and read the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the exercise of the spirit is the first item that we must work on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Applying Some Techniques</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I said earlier that according to my observation and experience, the best way to read Truth Lessons is that everyone reads instead of a few reading or only the teacher reading.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But all should not read together; rather, they should read a sentence each, one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider a basketball game.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not one person who holds the ball all the time or five persons simultaneously playing the ball; they pass the ball to one another and take turns playing it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Based on what I saw, almost all the churches commit the mistake of not reading in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that we will receive this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The advantage of teaching in this way is that in reading the lesson, everyone will spontaneously exercise to speak and we will not be the only one speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone will read consecutively, like five players passing a basketball from one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The most important thing in our home meetings and small group meetings is for everyone to speak, as if they are passing a basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best opportunity to train the saints to speak is when we teach them Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to explain to them or even give them a demonstration of how to read the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, in reading the lesson, we need to teach them how to pay attention to the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to an important point, we can ask someone to read it again, or even three or four times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the one who reads is experienced, he may be able to stress the point a little.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, not only will he gain the benefit, but everyone will be benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The newly saved ones and gospel friends in particular will be very impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The teacher and the student can profit from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The teacher speaks; the students speak; everyone speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spontaneously, we will all grow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not easy, but it is not too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope we can all practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not practice this in a rigid or monotonous way; instead, do it in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Third, after each section has been read, the teacher should highlight the subject and the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will give the saints a deeper impression and enable them to learn the truth and receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the teachers can speak with an exercised spirit, lead the saints to practice repeated reading, emphasized reading, reading that brings out the main points, and give a conclusion after each section, the saints will be able to taste the sweetness and riches of the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After each lesson, the saints will not only receive the knowledge of the truth but also the life supply released from the main points that were highlighted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a very profitable practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are also a few points to which we should pay attention.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we ask questions and highlight the main points, we should not pay too much attention to trivial things, such as history, geography, or the names of persons; rather, we should pay attention to the types, prophecies, and fulfillments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once I heard a teacher ask questions, not related to the prophecies of Christ but to the names and numbers of prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people may ask, Since we do not need to pay attention to all these things, why did you include them in the lessons?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have already pointed out that for a chicken to grow properly, it needs to have bones, feathers, and skin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when this chicken is presented for man s enjoyment, the more meat there is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we compiled Truth Lessons, we included some of the bones, feathers, and skin, but this does not mean that we want them to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have read the Bible for sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From the very beginning, I started to memorize the names of persons and places, but until today I am not able to remember all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the trainees were to tell me that they have memorized only the names of the twelve minor prophets, I would not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, if they have not memorized all the points concerning Christ s prophecies, I would say that they should be dismissed and should leave the training.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am afraid, however, that many of them have memorized the names of persons but not the prophecies of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This indicates that our teaching of Truth Lessons has reversed the order of importance we are presenting only a pile of bones for people to gnaw on, but we cannot present the meat for people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a big failure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Last Lord s Day I joined a corporate Lord s table meeting in a certain hall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The saints were tested on the main points of the lessons and accordingly given rewards.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I agreed with their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They did not test on trivial matters but on the outlines in Adam, we see God s redemption; in Abel, we see God s way of redemption; in Enosh, we see man s need for God and man s calling upon Him to enjoy God s riches; in Enoch, we see one who was redeemed and who walked with God on the pathway of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not need to ask questions such as how long Enoch lived or how long he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The trivial matters are not important.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The most important thing is the spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All of the co-workers and elders should be teachers of Truth Lessons, and especially the younger ones should bear this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The older ones are already sixty or seventy years of age; the younger ones should pick up this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the Lord s recovery our teaching of the truth should not be the same as the way people teach theology.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For example, they teach the historical event of Abraham s being born in Ur of the Chaldees.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Instead, we should teach the spiritual matters and things, such as the spiritual significance of Ur of the Chaldees being a land of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must remember this kind of spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The failure of theological teaching is that even though people have received theological education, their comprehension of the spiritual matters is still incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What they learned are things such as history, geography, archaeology, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What we teach must be matters of spiritual significance.</S>
