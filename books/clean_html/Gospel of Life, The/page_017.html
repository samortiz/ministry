<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 16</h1><p><sup>1</sup>These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be stumbled. <sup>2</sup>They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God. <sup>3</sup>And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. <sup>4</sup>But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them. Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you.</p><h2 class="head4">3. The Work of the Spirit Consummating in the Mingling of Divinity with Humanity 16:5-33</h2><p><sup>5</sup>But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where are You going? <sup>6</sup>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. <sup>7</sup>But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.</p><p><sup>8</sup>And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: <sup>9</sup>Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; <sup>10</sup>And concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me; <sup>11</sup>And concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.<p><sup>12</sup>I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. <sup>13</sup>But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. <sup>14</sup>He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. <sup>15</sup>All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.</p><p><sup>16</sup>A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me. <sup>17</sup>Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father? <sup>18</sup>Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about. <sup>19</sup>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him and He said to them, Are you inquiring among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me? <sup>20</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. <sup>21</sup>A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world. <sup>22</sup>Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you. <sup>23</sup>And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give to you. <sup>24</sup>Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.</p><p><sup>25</sup>These things I have spoken to you in parables; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but I will report to you plainly concerning the Father. <sup>26</sup>In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you, <sup>27</sup>For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God. <sup>28</sup>I came forth out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father. <sup>29</sup>His disciples said, Behold, now You are speaking plainly and not saying any parable. <sup>30</sup>Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God. <sup>31</sup>Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? <sup>32</sup>Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. <sup>33</sup>These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; Ihave overcome the world.</p>
