   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; 2 Cor 12:15; 8:12-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is something that many Christians know.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, even though many are familiar with this doctrine, few live the life of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, we will briefly mention three aspects of the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE CHURCH BEING AN ORGANISM OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>AND EVERY BELIEVER NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>TO FUNCTION ORGANICALLY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to practice the Body life, we first need to see that the Body is a living entity, an organism of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, every member in the Body should exercise his function organically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, the many members in our physical body are not the result of organization or arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every member has its respective function from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our physical life is the organic function of all the members in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I speak, apparently I am exercising only my throat, lips, and tongue, but actually my eyes, shoulders, and the rest of my body are all coordinated to enable me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am not a robot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am a living person, and I speak living words with the coordination of all the members in my body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, whenever we think of the church, we are unable to drop the natural concept of a social gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We think that the church is an organization, a mere collection of people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to know that our being members of the church is not because we are Christians who were baptized and have joined a group.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are members of the church because we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition to our human life we have received the Lord Jesus, the living God, into our inner being as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what makes us members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regeneration does not involve what the Chinese proverbs refer to as correcting one s errors and making a fresh start or being dead to yesterday s mistakes and being reborn today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regeneration is the addition of another life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we believe into the Lord, God s life enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regeneration enables us to be God s children and members of Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is God s life within us that enables us to have an organic union with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we cannot see this union, we nevertheless have illustrations of this union.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, the many light bulbs in the meeting hall may not appear to be related to one another, but the electricity within each light bulb is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through this connection, the union of electricity, all the light bulbs are connected with the power plant and are one entity; they have the same electricity flowing through them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this electricity, the light bulbs become one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apart from electricity, the light bulbs are not related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a picture of all those who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before we were saved, we were sinners who were unrelated to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after we were saved, the life of God, like electricity, entered into us, and we thus became one entity in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason that we come together: we are an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man s Way Damaging</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>the Organic Function of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From church history we see that the church became degraded shortly after the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church became degraded because it departed from its function as an organism in God s life and fell into the organization of human society.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Catholicism there are bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and a pope above the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same principle, Protestantism has many levels of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>History shows that religious organizations have damaged the organic function of many members in Christ s Body; human organization has annulled the organic function of many members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In most religious meetings one person speaks and the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This way of meeting has only a few benefits but brings in much damage and has many drawbacks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not easy to give a message to an audience of one thousand people, and not all seminary graduates are good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In recent years a renowned evangelist emerged in America, but this is quite rare.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The result of one person speaking a message to an audience is that the function of the saints is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before this meeting, we could hear many voices in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many saints were praying and singing in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, as soon as the speaker stood on the podium, everyone became quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This situation is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When many saints come to the meeting, only their ears are open, but their mouths are shut.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seems that giving a message helps the saints, but over the long run, it does more harm than good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many saints among us have listened to messages for more than twenty or thirty years and have become experts in listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more they listen, the more they prefer to listen instead of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They give every speaking brother a grade for his message.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, this brother does not have the right tone, or that brother does not know how to give appropriate examples.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their criticism may be accurate, but after listening to so many messages and criticizing the speakers, can they themselves speak?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The purpose of setting up the small group is so that all of us will not only exercise our ears to listen but also exercise our mouths to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the listening experts must learn to speak in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After hearing so many messages, it is unreasonable that they cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us use another example.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How long does it take for a child to learn to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It would be unthinkable for a normal child to listen to others for thirty-six years yet be unable to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we continue to listen without exercising to speak in the church meetings, we will not be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must therefore consider this situation and find a way to enable the saints to exercise to speak.</S>
