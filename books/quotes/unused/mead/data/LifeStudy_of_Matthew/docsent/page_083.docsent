   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not to Repeat Empty Words</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we pray, we are not to repeat empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 7 says, And in praying do not repeat empty words as the nations do; for they suppose that they will be heard through their much speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean, however, that we should not repeat our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord repeated His prayer in Gethsemane 26:44 , the Apostle Paul prayed the same prayer three times 2 Cor 12:8 , and the great multitude in heaven praised God with hallelujahs repeatedly Rev 19:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It means that we should not repeat with empty words, words in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 8 says, Therefore do not be like them, for God your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although God our Father knows our need, we still need to ask Him, because he who asks receives 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Pattern of Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 9 through 13 we find the pattern of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is not the pattern for all prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The prayer presented here in Matthew 6 is absolutely different from the prayer taught in John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 6 we are not told to pray in the Lord s name, but in John chapters fourteen through seventeen the Lord Jesus tells us repeatedly to pray in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this difference is that the prayer here in Matthew is not related to life; it is related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this short pattern of prayer the kingdom is mentioned at least twice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 10 says, Let Your kingdom come, and verse 13 says, For Yours is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The prayer in John, on the contrary, is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praying in the Lord s name is not a matter of the kingdom, but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To pray in the Lord s name means that we are one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In praying to the Father, we are one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we are praying in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To pray in the Lord s name is actually to pray in the Person of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are praying with Him in one name and in one life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we are one with Him in life, praying to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But as we have seen, the prayer in Matthew 6 is absolutely different, for it is a prayer of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you would have some prayer in life, you must go to John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must abide in the Lord and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must remain in your spirit and pray in oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what it means to pray in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the prayer in Matthew 6 concerns the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, it is a fighting prayer, a prayer of warfare against God s enemy for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 9 begins with the words, Pray, then, like this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The words like this do not mean to recite.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Acts and the Epistles there is no example of such reciting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, in certain Christian denominations today this prayer is recited during every Sunday morning service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I recited this prayer very often as a youth in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not to say that those who recite this prayer are not sincere in doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt there have been a good number who were very sincere in their repeating of this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>a. Praying That God s Name May Be Sanctified</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the example of prayer patterned by the Lord, the first three petitions imply the Trinity of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let Your name be sanctified is mainly related to the Father, let Your kingdom come to the Son, and let Your will be done to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth Psa 8:1 , the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ Rev 11:15 , and the will of God will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 9 says, Our Father Who is in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today God s name is not sanctified; rather, it is profaned and made common.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Unbelievers may ask, What is God?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>People speak about Jesus Christ in the same way that they speak about Plato or Hitler.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They make the name of the Lord Jesus common.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we know that the day will come, in the millennium, when the name of God will be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But, prior to that time, our Father s name is wholly sanctified in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not call upon the Father or speak the name of the Lord in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, when we say Father or Lord, we sanctify these holy names.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we need to pray, O Father, let Your name be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praying That God s Kingdom May Come</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 10 says, Let Your kingdom come.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the kingdom is here in the church life today, the manifestation of the kingdom is yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, we must pray for the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This matter of the kingdom is clearly related to God the Son.</S>
