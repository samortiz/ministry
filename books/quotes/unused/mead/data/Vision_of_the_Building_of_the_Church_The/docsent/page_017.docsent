   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATAN S FRUSTRATION AND COUNTERFEITS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us go back and look at some matters on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most readers of the Bible know that after God s purpose and the way to fulfill it were revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis, the serpent, who was the incarnation of Satan, appeared in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan came to harm and damage man by injecting his poison sin into man, thus bringing man into death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have the light concerning building, we will see that the reason Satan wanted to ruin man and put man to death was that he wanted to frustrate God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The man created by God was God s material for building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in his stratagem to frustrate God s building, Satan s first step was to poison the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan not only used subtlety to poison the material prepared by God for His building, but he also preceded God by producing a counterfeit that was according to what God had wanted to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan knew that what God ultimately wanted was a builded city, so before God could do that, Satan did something to produce a counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wanted to build a city, so Satan stirred up some persons whom he had poisoned to build another city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, in Genesis 4 Cain built a city, and he named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That city was full of sin and wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What kind of image did the city of Enoch have?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What did it express?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt, the city of Enoch altogether had the image of Satan and completely expressed Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The city of Enoch was a mixture of Satan and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually, the wickedness of this city became so great that it incurred God s judgment by the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must remember that the age which was destroyed by the flood had the city of Enoch as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God saved Noah and his household from that destruction, and Noah s building of the ark was again a story of building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not long afterward, Satan came again to corrupt the descendants of Noah, and he instigated them to build Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They wanted to build a city and a tower with its top reaching heaven so that they might make a name for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their rebellion directly touched the realm of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, God Himself intervened and stopped their rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After judging Babel, God called out from Babel a person named Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God promised Abraham to give him and his seed the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, God also promised to make Abraham into a great nation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, Abraham pitched a tent and built an altar in Canaan 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I want you to see that the one matter emphasized in the entire Bible is the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The people utilized by Satan were building something, and Abraham, who had been called out by God, was also building something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abraham s whole life was a story of pitching his tent and building an altar in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tent that he pitched and the altar that he built were just a miniature or scaled-down model of the tabernacle built by his descendants in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, Lot, Abraham s companion, went down to another city, the third corrupt city recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first corrupt city was the city of Enoch, which was destroyed by the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second was Babel, which was judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third was the city of Sodom, where Lot went.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sodom was also a building constructed with the mixture of Satan and man, and Lot fell into its midst.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, Sodom suffered God s judgment and was destroyed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only Abraham was still dwelling in a tent, building an altar, and serving God in the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Subsequently, the descendants of Abraham went down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time the fourth city that Satan built appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This city comprised the two storage cities that the Israelites built for Pharaoh when they were serving as slaves in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Pharaoh forced them to build these two cities with bricks of baked clay.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day, however, God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt so that they no longer had to bake clay into bricks to build cities for Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, they refined gold and silver to build God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the children of Israel entered into Canaan, they rose up to build the city of Jerusalem and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In contrast, Satan also built something; he built the city of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the end of the Bible, we not only see the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God s building throughout the ages, but we also see the great Babylon as the consummation of Satan s building throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two cities are in contrast with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all know that it was the armies of Babylon that destroyed the city of Jerusalem and the temple and carried away the vessels that were in the temple to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the children of Israel were restored, they came back from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ezra said that on the first day of the first month of the year he began to go up from Babylon to return to Jerusalem Ezra 7:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Babylon represents Satan s building, and Jerusalem represents the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The two are in contrast with one another from the beginning to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the entire Bible speaks of the matter of building, both on the positive side and on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan wants to utilize man to build the great Babylon, while God wants to gain a group of people to build the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can clearly see these two lines in the Bible.</S>
