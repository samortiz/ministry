   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 47</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the believers' experiencing the dispensing of the divine Trinity corporately by living in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>9 Loving the Brothers and Loving One Another in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we live in the church, we love all the brothers; that is, we love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason for this is that, as Romans 12:9-21 indicates, in the church the believers live a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 9a Paul says, "Let love be without hypocrisy," and in 10a he continues, "Love one another warmly in brotherly love."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This corresponds to Peter's word about loving "one another from the heart fervently" 1 Pet 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 13:34 and 35 the Lord Jesus said, "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this all men shall know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This commandment is the message which we "heard from the beginning, that we should love one another" 1 John 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not try in a natural way to fulfill this word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may realize that God is love 1 John 4:8 and that we are commanded to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in a natural, religious, and ethical way we may try to love others, imitating God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our nature as human beings there is the tendency to love in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of love is ethical, natural, and even cultural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, real love is the issue of enjoying the processed Triune God in the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are in the fellowship of the divine life, that is, in the enjoyment of the Triune God, this enjoyment will have a certain issue or outcome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The outcome of the enjoyment of the Triune God is the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we enjoy the Triune God, this enjoyment issues in the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With this love we spontaneously love others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In particular, we love all those who are organically related to our begetting Father 1 John 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been begotten of the Father, and many others also have been begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we enjoy Him, the result will be that we love all His children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, loving the brothers is the issue of enjoying the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of trying to imitate the Lord's love, we need to be constituted of the Triune God who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This One abides in us and wants to impart Himself into our being and saturate us with Himself so that we may enjoy Him inwardly as love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This love should saturate us until it becomes the love with which we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The revelation concerning love in the New Testament is different from our natural concept of love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The very God who is love abides in us, and we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to 1 John 3:24, "We know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Spirit keeps us in an organic union with the Triune God who is love, causing this God to become our life and even our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, this Spirit is saturating us with the substance of the God who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, the fibers of our being will be constituted of the loving essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the divine love becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then spontaneously we love others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, we do not love them by our own love; we love them by God as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a great difference there is between this kind of love and the love that is simply a human attempt to imitate the love of God!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the New Testament, the love the believers have for one another is actually a triangular love, a love that involves three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a child of God born of Him, we surely love our Father, the One who has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since we love the begetting Father, we shall also love those who have been begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we have a triangular love, a love involving God, ourselves, and all those born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This triangular love is in the organic union with the Triune God who is love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How is it possible for believers to love God and to love one another?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is possible only because we have had the divine birth John 1:12-13; 1 John 5:1; 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:4, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been born of God, begotten of Him, and because of this birth we are able to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the triangular love is related to the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we love not only the One who has begotten us, our begetting Father, but also the ones begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the love with which the believers love one another in the church life.</S>
