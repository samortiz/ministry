   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TROUBLE CONCERNING CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another trouble arose later in the church because the Jews tried to bring in the practice of circumcision to the Gentile churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is clearly revealed and recorded in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even Paul and Barnabas stopped their ministry to go up to Jerusalem to get this thing solved, and it was solved by the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE TROUBLE OF BARNABAS'S OPINION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Right after that, another trouble came up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This trouble was Barnabas s opinion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He wanted to bring his cousin John Mark with him to go on in the ministry with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But Paul realized that Mark should be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He should not be easily permitted to come back to the ministry on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was because he had withdrawn from the ministry in Pamphylia on their last trip.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Paul intended to discipline Mark so that he could learn, but Barnabas was opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He quarreled with Paul, and there was a big division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Paul was a new convert, Barnabas ushered him into the church and into the ministry 11:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At first Barnabas was the one who took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when they were sent on their first trip, Barnabas was the leader at the beginning 13:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later in their journey, however, Paul began to take the lead in the apostolic ministry 13:9; 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After Paul was in the lead, Barnabas eventually became opinionated, not in secular things but in the holy ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Bible did not have such a record, we could never imagine that Barnabas could be that much opinionated to insist on taking his cousin with them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul and Barnabas were divided not by a great doctrine such as that of the Divine Trinity but because of Barnabas's cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE TROUBLE OF APOLLOS'S OLDNESS AND OPINION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another trouble arose later with a new Jewish convert named Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was acquainted with the Bible and eloquent in teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A great number of people were helped through his teaching, yet he was behind in the revelation of God's up-to-date economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He knew only the baptism of John.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not know that there was an advance after John.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That advance was the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you read only 18:24-28, you may admire Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This positive record shows that he was very much helped in the way of God by Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This couple was up-to-date with God's present-day economy, and they helped him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But chapter nineteen of Acts shows us the unique result of Apollos's work in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This result shows us that he did not change.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he had been adjusted by Aquila and Priscilla, he would have adjusted these twelve disciples in Ephesus who had been baptized only into John's baptism vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He would have told them that they needed to be baptized again into the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He would have said, "I'm sorry that I haven't brought you into the present move of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am short of this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now I have received the help, so I want to adjust you."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he would have done this, there would have been no need for Paul to come and help these men be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This proves that although Aquila and Priscilla worked to help Apollos, he did not practice what he was helped with.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that it is not so easy for us to drop our old way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The best athletes are trained to drop their natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Good pianists also must drop their natural way and take the trained way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The natural way is the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, Apollos was very much helped by Aquila, yet he did not practice what he was helped with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We know this because the result of his work still remained as something old.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Acts 18 says that Aquila and Priscilla taught him the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Surely they would have taught him about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was probably the first item that Aquila and Priscilla told Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God did not tolerate John's continuing in his ministry once the Lord Jesus appeared on the scene, and he was eventually beheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do believe Aquila would have told Apollos about this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those twelve disciples in Ephesus should have been adjusted by Apollos before Paul arrived but they were not.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People who read Acts 18 admire Apollos, but Acts 19 shows that he caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he was in Ephesus, he left twelve there with a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later Apollos brought a problem to Corinth by causing an opinion among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some there said, "I am of Apollos" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul deals with the problem of division in the first four chapters of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then at the end of 1 Corinthians Paul said, "And concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity" 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that Paul begged Apollos to go back to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Apollos should have gone back to tell the Corinthians not to say that they were of Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But Apollos told Paul that he would not go then.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead, he would go when he had the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That was his opinion.</S>
