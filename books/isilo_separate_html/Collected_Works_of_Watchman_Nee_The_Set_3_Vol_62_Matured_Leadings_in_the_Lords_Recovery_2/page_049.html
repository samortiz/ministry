He must be able to touch the spirit's feelings. Hebrews 5 says that the faculties must be exercised for discriminating between both good and evil. To be exercised means to learn to follow the feeling of the Holy Spirit. Romans 12 speaks of the renewing of the understanding, while Hebrews 5 speaks of the exercising of the faculties. This means to learn to respond to the sense of the Holy Spirit within us. This is analogous to the growth of a child. In the process of his growth, he learns different things, and he develops different sets of feelings. When he is young, he has one set of feelings. When he grows up, he has another set of feelings. A brother or sister starts his or her learning from the time he or she is regenerated. A young man of twenty years old must be very careful about how he develops his emotion and mind. He has to grow in the right direction. By forty years old, he can be considered a grown up and mature person. The same can be said of our spiritual consciousness; we have to exercise ourselves to develop it as early as possible. You have to know what is the restraining of the Spirit, what is the urging of the Spirit, the leading of the Spirit, and the forbidding of the Spirit. If you do not know these things, you are still a child as far as being a Christian is concerned. You are like a forty-year-old man with a sensitivity of a ten-year-old boy.</p><p>A Christian is different from a person in the world. You cannot live by the set of feelings you acquired in your physical growth. You have to acquire a new set of feelings, the spiritual feelings you received at the time of your regeneration. Let me repeat this word again and again to the elders: If the leading ones are not quick and sharp enough in spiritual consciousness, the whole church will be led astray; there will not be the manifestation of the authority of the Holy Spirit. If you do not know the activities of the Holy Spirit within you individually, there is no way for the Holy Spirit to get through in the church. A blind man has one set of feelings. However, once his eyes are opened, he will have another set of feelings. The set of feelings a Christian acquires after regeneration is very special. If you do not learn to exercise them, you will not be able to help the brothers and sisters develop a spiritual consciousness. There are many feelings which are hard to explain; you can only acquire them through practice. If you do not practice, you will not be conscious of anything even when your feelings go astray. This is like a blind man whose consciousness of everything is black.</p><p>We have to pray to the Lord that He would maintain our consecration. This is a lesson that goes on for the rest of our life. No one can say that he has graduated in the matter of consecration. We cannot make any mistake in our consecration. We have to maintain its freshness. After this we have to learn to exercise our spirit and acquire spiritual feelings. We should not try to touch things with our mind. A blind man is very exercised in his auditory faculty. He exercises his ears not only to listen to the radio but to everything around him. But once his eyes are open, he will try to see everything; he will exercise his seeing faculty. He will even try to examine the radio receiver with his eyes. Before a person is saved, he pays much attention to his mind, emotion, and will. He uses these faculties a great deal. But after he is saved, he can no longer be carried away by the vain mind, the old emotion, and the weak will in discerning the spiritual things. Instead, he has to exercise his spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW POINTS OF FELLOWSHIP REGARDING SERVICE</h2><p>The responsible brothers in a district should only bear responsibility for spiritual matters. They should step forward only when the other brothers and sisters cannot fulfill their functions. Even then they should not monopolize everything. The meetings should be under the control of the Holy Spirit. Whether they act or not, they have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. For this reason the elders must have spiritual feelings and must be able to direct the meetings in the right direction. All the other brothers and sisters should be trained and taught how to meet. In the meetings the sisters cannot teach, but they can call hymns and testify. In the prayer meetings and bread-breaking meetings, the sisters should pray in the middle of the meeting. They should not initiate or conclude the meetings with their prayers. They should also avoid calling hymns as much as possible, unless they are clear they have the prompting of the Spirit. If anyone makes a mistake in the meeting, there is no need to correct him immediately unless, of course, the mistake is very serious. After the meeting those who made the mistakes should be given some fellowship in love. If a brother does something wrong in the meeting, it is improper for others to keep silent in the meeting yet speak behind his back after the meeting. We should speak to the erring one. But it is not love when we speak behind his back, not to his face. It is inevitable for some to make mistakes in the meetings. The only way we can be sure that everything is right is if we call the hymns, pray, and do everything ourselves. But then we will monopolize the entire meeting. On the one hand, we have to allow the brothers and sisters to function. On the other hand, all of them need to be adjusted and perfected. Otherwise, they will never learn. All the responsible ones in all the "homes" (i.e., districts) should meet once a week. At other times there should be many love feasts in the small groups. The number in each group should not be too large.</p><p>The sixth "home" has too few saints because the brothers and sisters there were somewhat separated from the church in the past. In the future we need many gospel meetings in this district. The brothers and sisters must also bring new ones to the meetings. Do not ask people to sign in all the time. The districts in Chan's home and Shen's home should take care of the new immigrants as soon as possible. They should arrange visits to these new arrivals within the shortest possible time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
