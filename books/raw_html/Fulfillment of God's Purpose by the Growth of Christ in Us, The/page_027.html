<P>This thought is not only in 1 Corinthians but also in Genesis 2. The tree of life is a plant. Along with the tree of life there is a river, and this is the watering. Thus, we have the planting and the watering. Then at the flow of the river there are gold, bdellium [pearl], and onyx stone, a precious stone (vv. 9-12). The thought in 1 Corinthians 3 was there already in Genesis 2. The growth of the plantation produces minerals. Actually, this is very scientific. Something of the mineral life is in the plant life. When we eat the plant life, we also receive something of the mineral life. We receive minerals such as iron, salt, sulphur, and zinc. Our physical body is built up with a number of minerals.</P><P>The church is not something that is organized or formed in an outward way. The church is a body built up with Christ, yet this Christ is of the plant life and the mineral life. If you want to know more about this, I would ask you to read The All-Inclusive Christ. In that book I point out a number of aspects of Christ which are typified by both the vegetable life and the mineral life (see chapters five through eight, pp. 46-87). Christ is the vegetable life to us to produce all the minerals. The farm of God, the plantation of God, produces the precious material, gold, silver, and precious stones.</P><P>Now in the church we, the laborers of God, are planting and watering with the expectation that God's farm will produce the precious material for His building. Christ as the vine in John 15 produces the fruit for the Father's glorification (v. 8), but if we have just the fruit, we do not have the material for the building. We cannot build a house with clusters of grapes. The plantation of God's farming is for producing gold, silver, and precious stones for His building.</P><P>Some may just want to be the fruit, which is soft and sweet, but ultimately our growth is for God's building. I have met a number of sweet saints, but there is nothing good in them for the building. Today in God's house, God needs the hard, solid material. You and I have to be so solid, not so soft and sweet. If we are so sweet, the building is gone. Today in all the places, we need some hard ones. The grapes are good for appreciation, but not good for the building. God today needs some solid material to be produced out of the growth of God's plantation. Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth, not to produce fruit, but to produce gold, silver, and precious stones. The Lord has to change our concept, to turn our natural understanding to His revelation. Gold signifies God's divine nature, the nature of the Father. Silver, in typology, signifies redemption, the redeeming work of the Son. Precious stones are transformed material, signifying the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. This is the work of the Triune God to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, which are the material to build up God's house.</P><P>We all need to grow in life for the transformation in life. Some of the sisters among us are wild and bold. This is natural. Other sisters are so timid. This is also natural. We need to grow so that we will become so strong and solid in the Lord's testimony. In the church life all the timid sisters have to be strong, not in a natural way, but in a spiritual way. When the time comes for a sister to give a testimony, her testimony should be solid. At that time she should be so strong, solid, and hard, like a diamond.</P>
