<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JOURNEYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(9)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Num. 16:19-50</H1><P>Concerning the serious rebellion in chapter sixteen, we have already considered the rebels, the cause of the rebellion, and the reaction of Moses. In this message we will see how God judged this rebellion (16:19-50).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God's Judgment</H2><P>No matter what is happening on earth, God's government still stands, not only over His house, the church, but also over the entire world. From our study of history and from our observation of the present situation of the world, we are assured that everything is under God's government. We must believe, therefore, that everything, including judgment, is under Him, up to Him, and in His hand.</P><P>In chapter sixteen of Numbers, God's judgment is threefold, coming from the earth, from heaven, and from within the people themselves. The earth opened up to swallow certain of the rebellious ones, fire came from heaven to consume many others among the rebels, and germs from within others of the rebellious ones produced a plague that killed them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Korah Gathering All<br>the Assembly against Moses and Aaron</H2><P>Korah gathered all the assembly, not just his company or party, against Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the tent of meeting (v. 19a). This forced God to come out and appear in His glory to all the assembly (v. 19b). God's appearing in such a way was a very significant event.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Speaking to Moses and Aaron</H2><P>Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, telling them to separate themselves from among this assembly that He may consume the assembly in a moment (vv. 20-21). Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces and said, "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the assembly?" (v. 22).</P><P>Moses and Aaron addressed God as "the God of the spirits of all flesh." The assembly was a composition of flesh, but all those in the assembly had a spirit. God is the God not of the flesh of people but of their spirit.</P>
