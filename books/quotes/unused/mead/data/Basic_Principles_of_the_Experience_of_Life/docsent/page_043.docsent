   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE DEALING WITH THE SELF 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:21-26; Luke 9:25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen what the flesh is, but it is more difficult to see what the self is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord says that we must deny our self and bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently, we are very familiar with a scriptural term such as self, but if we go into its details, it is hard to find a proper definition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE SELF BEING EQUIVALENT TO THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Matthew 16 and Luke 9, the self is equivalent to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 16:26 says, "For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Similarly, Luke 9:25 says, "For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we compare these two passages, we can see that according to the Lord's word, the self in Luke 9 is the soul in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if the self is exactly the same as the soul, it seems that there is no need to have two terms.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, there must still be a definite meaning to self.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have seen, the flesh in its full meaning is the fallen man as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this fallen man there are three parts the fallen body, the fallen soul, and the fallen spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All three parts of the human being are fallen to the extent that the whole person becomes flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man becomes flesh simply because his whole person is under the control and influence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fallen body is the main part of the fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The next part of the fallen being is the fallen soul, and the least part of the fallen being is the fallen spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Scriptures, especially the New Testament, the fallen spirit has very little to do with the flesh, the fallen man as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fallen spirit is simply dormant, sleeping, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fallen body of the fallen person, on the other hand, is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we look at today's society, the human community, we can see how active the fallen body of fallen man is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within the fallen body is the most evil matter, which is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 7 tells us that sin dwells in the members of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy to explain what the body and sin are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The body is the form, the vessel, made by God, while sin is something from Satan other than the body which came into the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Scriptures do not say that sin is equivalent to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, they do reveal that the self is equivalent to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, it is difficult to explain the difference between the self and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the fallen soul there is another evil matter, which is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the fallen body there is sin, while with the fallen soul there is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, with the fallen man as a whole, as the flesh, there are two problems: sin and self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sin is in the body; self is in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we could eradicate sin and self from the fallen person, he would be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we become Christians, we need to deal with sin, and we need to deal with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be released from sin, as taught in Romans 6, and we must deny the self, as taught in Matthew 16:24.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To say that we deal with the body means that we deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, to say that we deal with the soul means that we deal with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was nothing wrong with the created body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The body created by God was good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What made it wrong was that sin and lust came into it from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was something other than what God created.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way, there was nothing wrong with the soul as created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The soul created by God was good, but within the soul there is now the self, which makes it wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God created a soul, but God did not create a self.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the soul is under the control of the spirit and dependent on God, it is a pure and right soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the condition of the human soul as created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Due to the fall, however, the soul created by God declared independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the fall, man took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into his body, but before that, he took the thought, suggestion, opinion, and idea of Satan into his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, man declared independence from God in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If man had kept his soul dependent on God, he would never have disobeyed God and taken the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because man's soul became independent of God, the soul became the self.</S>
