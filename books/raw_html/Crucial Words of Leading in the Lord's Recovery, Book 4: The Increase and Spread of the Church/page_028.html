	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MEMBERS<br />
OF A SMALL GROUP</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE IN A LIVING WAY<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In the church life we need to read the Bible in a living way; this requires practice. For example, the subject of this chapter is &ldquo;The Functioning of the Members of a Small Group.&rdquo; The main points related to the subject of this chapter are taken from Romans 12. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; Verse 8 says, &ldquo;He who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.&rdquo; And verse 15 says, &ldquo;Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.&rdquo; It is worthwhile to read these verses, but we also need to read them in a living way.</p>
<p>Consider Song of Songs 1:8, which says, &ldquo;If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds&rsquo; tents.&rdquo; The focus of this verse is not on the one who is the fairest among women; rather, it is on pasturing the young goats by the shepherds&rsquo; tents. Christ is the Shepherd, and the churches are the shepherds&rsquo; tents. In a small group some members must bear responsibility to bring the young and weak goats to the gatherings.</p>
<p>Likewise, in reading 2 Timothy 2:2, we should pay attention to the fact that the main point is not on &ldquo;the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses&rdquo; but rather on committing these things to &ldquo;faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; The members of a small group must be faithful men who are competent to teach others. After learning the truth and bringing the young goats to a gathering, there is a need to nourish and teach them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should learn to exercise the spirit when we gather; we do not need to wait for certain brothers to arrive before starting the meeting. In many so-called churches the Sunday service begins only after the pastor arrives and shakes the hand of everyone who is in attendance; this is not proper. Our gatherings do not belong to certain leading brothers but to everyone. If this were the case, we would not be able to meet without a so-called leading one being present. Our gatherings also do not depend on religious rituals, such as singing and praying at the beginning of the meeting. If this were the case, we would not be able to meet without first singing and praying. One time in a meeting I said, &ldquo;Today we will not sing hymns.&rdquo; The saints responded by immediately beginning to pray. Then I said, &ldquo;Today we will also not pray.&rdquo; At once they wanted to read the Bible. Then I said, &ldquo;Let us start the meeting without any singing, praying, reading of the Word, testifying, or sharing.&rdquo; This perplexed the saints, and they did not know what to do. However, this is not a difficult situation for someone with experience in &ldquo;playing ball&rdquo; in a coordinated way.</p>
<p>For instance, two brothers could speak on God&rsquo;s creation of man in Genesis 1 in the form of questions and answers. Brother A could say, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s creation of man was wonderful,&rdquo; and Brother B could ask, &ldquo;In what way was it wonderful?&rdquo; Brother A could reply, &ldquo;When God created all things, He spoke, and they came into existence, but before the creation of man, the Triune God held a conference.&rdquo; Brother B could then ask, &ldquo;What do you mean by a conference?&rdquo; Brother A could answer, &ldquo;There was a consideration, a conference, within the Godhead concerning the creation of man. In this conference the Triune God said, &lsquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness&rsquo;&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26). Brother B could pursue further, asking, &ldquo;What is the image of God?&rdquo; If a meeting was conducted in this way, no one would fall asleep, and Genesis 1:26 would be in our hearts forever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a brother could be asked to memorize and recite Genesis 1:1: &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; Another person could be asked to memorize and recite verse 26: &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; Then a third person could be asked to memorize and recite the first part of verse 31: &ldquo;God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good.&rdquo; At this point, we could ask others to speak on the main thought covered in verses 1, 26, and 31, which is God&rsquo;s creation and the center of God&rsquo;s creation being man.</p>
<p>This illustration shows how we frequently follow old, traditional, natural, and religious concepts rather than exercising our spirit. The culture of the world is constantly progressing. However, in the last two thousand years Christianity has fallen backward rather than advancing. The New Testament contains nothing old, traditional, natural, or religious; it is altogether a revelation of God&rsquo;s economy, which is exceedingly fresh. The apostles brought this revelation to a peak, but the condition of the church began to gradually decline because the saints did not hold to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Later, many old, traditional, natural, and religious concepts were applied to the New Testament. Consequently, over the years, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was completely lost to those in Christianity.</p>
<p>People who attend services in Christianity hear nothing of the high revelation in the New Testament. Although the Bible is in print and in their hands, Christians see nothing of God&rsquo;s revelation when they read the Bible. Instead, they read with their mind and interpret the Scriptures based on their own concepts. Even though our way of reading the Bible is absolutely different from those in Christianity, we still have elements of oldness in our meetings.</p>
<p>Our meetings should reflect the corporate move of the Spirit. We should follow the Spirit, and we should exercise our spirit to be fresh and living. Anyone who has played basketball knows that the ball can be passed to him at any moment. Hence, every person on the team needs to be prepared to receive the ball. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need to learn to exercise our spirit to worship God, who is Spirit. When we read the Bible with our spirit, our reading is our worship to God. In many heathen religions, people are required to worship by kneeling down and prostrating themselves before idols. Our worship, however, is in spirit. If we read the Bible according to the inspiration of the Spirit in a meeting, the supply that others receive will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>When we meet together, our reading of the Bible should be living. After reading a verse in a living way, a simple prayer can be offered, a hymn can be called, and even a testimony can be given. This kind of exercise will cause everyone to be living. Without the exercise of the spirit, anything we do will be inappropriate and only bring in confusion. We need to exercise our spirit in the meetings because we should not regulate or attempt to direct the corporate move of the Spirit in the meeting. After singing or reading the Bible, some may be inspired to give testimonies, and others may follow with another hymn. In this way there will be a fresh supply in the meeting and no long pauses.</p>
<p>Under the influence of both Christianity and our natural man, it is very easy to fall into rituals rather than to exercise our spirit. Without such an exercise, outward forms may change, but the old content will remain. Hence, we should exercise to be in spirit, because there are no rituals in our spirit; there are only the riches of Christ with all of His freshness. With the exercise of the spirit, every meeting will be living, and the church will be fully revived.</p>
