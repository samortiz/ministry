   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How we thank the Lord for recovering the genuine oneness, the oneness that has been lost by Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This oneness is all-inclusive; it includes all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Division, on the contrary, includes all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that when we come back to the oneness, all the godly, heavenly, spiritual things return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason is that all these things exist in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, we must admit that we are still quite short and have a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, we can testify that the Lord's riches surely are to be found in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The unique ground of oneness is here, and all the spiritual riches are included with this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the godly things and all the spiritual riches are ours on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ON THE GROUND OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The testimony of the Lord today goes along with the recovery of the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This testimony does not depend on our efforts at self-improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may make up our minds to improve ourselves, only to fall once again into failure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's testimony does not depend on our efforts; it depends on His work within us on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we came into the church life, spontaneously the aspiration for godliness, holiness, and spirituality was stirred within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was not our own doing; it was altogether the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we are on the proper ground, the ground of oneness, the Word of God is transparently open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is wholly due to the Lord's blessing on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where the recovery of the ground of oneness is, there the testimony of the Lord is also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God's people in the Old Testament returned to Jerusalem, all the things pertaining to God's testimony returned: the altar, the offerings, the temple, the feasts, and the rich enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, those who remained in Babylon had nothing to do with the testimony of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The godly things were found not in Babylon; they were in Jerusalem, the unique place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though God's returned people were weak or inadequate in many respects, it cannot be denied that the Lord's testimony was with them, not with those in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, the return of God's people to the ground of oneness was also used by God to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus, was a descendant of those who had returned from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the captives had not returned, there would not have been a way for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There would have been no channel, no means, for Him to come forth according to the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the return from captivity in Babylon was a necessary preparation for the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same principle, I believe that the Lord's recovery today will be used by God as a preparation for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord fully use His recovery for the sake of His coming back!</S>
