[1]  IN THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 13:19; Acts 20:30; Eph 4:14 OUTLINE The present turmoil in the Lord s recovery: Instigated by the evil one Matt 13:19.
[2]  The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord s recovery: With a genuine and sincere concern for the Lord s recovery: Without any biased view concerning any matter.
[3]  Now I would like to point out to you the turmoils among the children of God in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[4]  One among the disciples selected by the Lord Jesus was Judas, who also became a betrayer v. 16 . During the apostle Paul s lifetime, the church life passed through turmoils that were full of problems.
[5]  A rebellion such as the one we are encountering now in the Lord s recovery is not only instigated by the evil spiritual source but also is carried out through human instruments.
[6]  The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord s recovery is through the proper and common fellowship of the Body.
[7]  For the saints edification, we have to sacrifice our seekings; for the churches benefit, we have to ignore our interest; for the Body of Christ s building up, we have to give up any kind of personal preference; for the keeping of the oneness of the Body, we have to drop all kinds of personal insistings; and for the spreading of the Lord s recovery, we have to forget about our territories.
[8]  In August of this year, the brothers who are taking the lead in the present trouble began to publish a paper called The Word and the Testimony in open opposition to the Lord s recovery and ministry.
[9]  Another great divisive factor in the past has been the negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord s recovery.
[10]  In the elders training in February 1986, my burden was to ask the elders to take care of the one accord in the Lord s recovery.
[11]  THE LORD S MOVE TODAY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12; Matt 16:18; Rev 5:6b; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Acts 5:42; John 21:15; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-26, 31; John 15:1, 5, 8a; Eph 3:19; John 3:29-30; Rev 19:7-8; 22:17; 21:1-2, 9b-10; Luke 19:12, 15a; Dan 2:34-35, 44-45; Rev 11:15 OUTLINE Our God is living 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12.
[12]  The direction of the Lord s move: To build up the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and dispensing God in His Divine Trinity for His full expression Eph 4:12; John 15:1, 5, 8a; Eph 3:19.
[13]  Concerning the direction of the Lord s move today, I fully believe that our God is living 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12 , that our Lord is moving Matt 16:18 , and that the Spirit is working Rev 5:6b .
[14]  To tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, is to preach the gospel, telling people how God has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light through His virtues, such as His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, His washing away of our sins, His justification, and His regeneration.
[15]  The direction of the Lord s move today is, first, to build up His organic Body Eph 4:12 , a Body full of Himself and built up with Himself Col 3:11 as the life-giving Spirit, who is the essence, the element, and the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ Eph 4:4a .
[16]  The direction of the Lord s move today is, second, to prepare His bride, the church, as His the Bridegroom s counterpart John 3:29-30 for the eternal marriage Rev 19:7-8 , the universal marriage, of the redeeming God with His redeemed people Rev 22:17; 21:1-2, 9b-10 .
[17]  The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into His believers in the church age Luke 17:21; Mark 4:3, 8, 26 and spreading in His increasing John 3:30 to be the enlarged, upcoming kingdom of God, which He will bring in at His coming back Luke 19:12, 15a; Rev 11:15 .
[18]  This upcoming, enlarged kingdom of God will be God s universal government in the new heaven and new earth for God s eternal administration in the fulfillment of God s eternal economy in Christ as God s ultimately consummated household administration in eternity.
[19]  Both God and Christ are aspiring to see the Body of Christ built up, to see the bride prepared, and to see the kingdom brought in, that Christ may have a Body, that Christ may have His bride, and that God may have a kingdom on this earth for His eternal economy.
