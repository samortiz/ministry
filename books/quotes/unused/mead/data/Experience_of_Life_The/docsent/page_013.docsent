   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION TO BE A SACRIFICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When one sees the basis of consecration and also has the motive of consecration, he is willing to consecrate himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What then is consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the meaning of consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 12:1 says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse shows us that the meaning of consecration is to be a "sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does the phrase "to be a sacrifice" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is a sacrifice?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Scripture shows us that whenever a thing is set apart from its original position and usage and is laid on God's altar, specifically for Him, this thing is then a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament men offered bullocks and rams as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is this: The bullock originally lived in a corral and was used for plowing the field and drawing carts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now it is taken out from the corral and brought beside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a change in its position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then it is killed, placed on the altar, and consumed by fire to be a sweet smelling savor unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a change in its usage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, this bullock becomes a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A sacrifice, therefore, is none other than a thing which is set apart for God and laid on the altar, with a change in position and a change in usage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether it is a bullock or a ram, whether it is fine flour or oil, once it is offered as a sacrifice, it leaves the hands of the offerer and can no longer be used for his own advantage and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the sacrifices on the altar belong to God and are for His use and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To put it simply, to be a sacrifice means to be offered to God for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we present ourselves to God as a living sacrifice, there are also these two aspects: one is a change in our position, and the other is a change in our usage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we understand this meaning of consecration, we can then discern the genuineness of the consecration of others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person says he is consecrated, we may ask whether he has changed his position and changed his usage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If not, he is not a sacrifice, and there is no true consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing is offered as a sacrifice without a change in position and in usage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who truly offer themselves, therefore, must pass completely out of their own hands and into God's hands for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a consecration is similar to the giving of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we give a gift to others, it changes position from our hands to theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is no longer ours to use; it is for their use.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In like manner, the day we truly consecrate ourselves, our position is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Formerly we were in our own hands; now we are in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Formerly we walked in our own way; now we lie on God's altar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the same time, our usage is also changed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly we lived for ourselves and were toward the world; now we are set apart solely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only this kind of consecration is true consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we thus present ourselves to God as a sacrifice, we become food for God; we are for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Among the offerings of the Israelites, some were for God's use, such as gold, silver, precious stones, threads of all colors, wool, and sheepskin Exo 25:2-7 ; and some were offered to God for food, such as the bullock, ram, pigeon, and turtledove used in the burnt-offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When these were offered as a burnt-offering, they were burnt on the altar and became a sweet savor, food for God Lev 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God accepted the sweet savor of these sacrifices, He was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The offering of these sacrifices is a type of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meaning, therefore, of offering ourselves as a sacrifice is offering ourselves to God as food which He will be pleased to accept and thus find satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are people who were originally like a pile of uncooked rice, which might be used for this or for that.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day, because of God's need, we were separated from the original pile of rice and were worked on in such a way that we were cooked and placed on God's table the altar and became God's food for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the meaning of being a sacrifice, and this is the meaning of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the meaning of consecration is to offer ourselves to God as a living sacrifice for God's satisfaction, we should ask ourselves this question: Since our consecration, how much of our actual living and actual experiences have proved that we have indeed laid ourselves on the altar to be a sacrifice for God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we indeed willing to be God's food that He might be satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>True consecration is never compelled by God; it is of our voluntary will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God takes nothing by force; everything is offered up by men willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, our consecration today must be made out of our voluntary will; it is we who willingly lie on the altar and dare not move off.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others may move about freely, but we dare not act in a casual way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others may calculate and choose between the sweet and the bitter, but when we encounter a difficulty, we dare not consider escape.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Others can reason and argue with God; we dare not say even one sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Others can evade God's will and avoid being bound and limited; we would rather be restricted by His will and willing to be imprisoned in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All this, because we have already offered ourselves to God and have been laid on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are already a consecrated people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should be able to say continually to God, "O God, I have no choice; I have already consecrated myself to Thee; I am in Thy hand."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever anything happens to us, we must express ourselves in this way to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must remain thus in God's hand and actually be a sacrifice unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only this is the true meaning of consecration.</S>
