   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that we can come to You through Your Word and Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We thank You that today You are so much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are the Word of life, and You are also the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we do trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You are not only with us; You are now indwelling us as the Word and as the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IN THE TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE RENEWED BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the previous two messages we covered the renewing of the believers by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this message we will consider the transformation of the renewed believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. Through the Renewing of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>in the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The transformation of the renewed believers takes place through the renewing of the mind, that is, in the soul Rom 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here again, the matter of renewing is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to my knowledge, those philosophers, such as Confucius, who stressed human ethics and morality also stressed renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, their renewing is carried out by self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, our renewing does not depend on our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It depends on the renewing element, that is, the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That element is nothing less than divinity ministered into our being as the very element that renews us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A chemical compound is not formed by man's effort.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is formed by the addition of a new element to another element that is already present.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same way, renewing is not carried out by our work or effort.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Renewing is accomplished by the renewing element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, renewing is not a work at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The process of renewing can be illustrated by the digestion of food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Strictly speaking, digestion is not a work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we take food into us, the food itself works along with our digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While the food is being digested within us, the nourishment enters into our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, that is not a work; it is the nourishing of the food element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be impressed that in the Bible the God-ordained and God-required renewing is not by our work; neither is it by God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In carrying out the renewing, God does everything by dispensing Himself into our being as the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This element within us means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The subjective sanctification is by this divine element, which is the holy nature, the holy element, of our Triune God.</S>
