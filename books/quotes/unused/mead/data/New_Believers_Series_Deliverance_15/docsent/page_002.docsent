   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN'S WILL BEING UNABLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO OVERCOME THE LAW OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul failed because he exercised his will to make resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After verse 21, Paul's eyes were opened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He saw that the enemy he was dealing with sin was nothing less than a law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When he saw that sin was a law, he could only sigh and say, "Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He realized that it was impossible for him to prevail over sin by his will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the will?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The will is man's own volition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is what man wants, determines, and decides to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is man's opinions and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once a man's will resolves to do something, he begins to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's will can produce some power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, there is power in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But herein lies the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the will comes in conflict with the law of sin, which one prevails?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The will usually prevails at the beginning, but ultimately sin prevails.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose you hold up a book that weighs one catty a Chinese measure of weight with your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Gravity is pulling it down while you are trying your best to hold it up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the unceasing operation of the law of gravity will eventually prevail, and the book will fall to the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may try to hold it up with your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may prevail for an hour, but after two hours you will feel tired, and after another hour your hand will no longer obey you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, you will let go of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Gravity never tires out, but your hand does.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law of gravity is pulling the book down continuously, every hour, every minute, and even every second.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your hand cannot fight against the law of gravity forever.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The longer you hold the book, the heavier it feels.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The book has not become heavier, but the law of gravity has triumphed over the power of your hand, and you feel as if the book has become heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same principle applies when you try to overcome sin with your will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The will can stand against sin for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the power of sin far exceeds the power of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin is a law; it is not destroyed by the resistance of man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever the power of the will slackens, the law of sin surfaces.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The human will cannot persist forever, but the law of sin is always active.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The will may prevail for a little while, but in the end it will always be overcome by the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we see that sin is a law, we keep trying to overcome it by our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When temptation comes, we hold our breath and try to overcome, only to find that it has overcome us instead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When temptation comes again, we make a stronger resolution because we think that our last failure was caused by a faulty resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We tell ourselves that we will not sin this time and that we will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the result is the same we fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not know why our resolution cannot bring us victory over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not realize that overcoming sin by the will never works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is easy to see that temper is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When someone says something unkind, you feel hurt and upset.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he continues to speak unpleasant words, you may hit your desk, blow up, exchange words, or do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Afterwards, you may feel that as a Christian you should not have lost your temper, and you may resolve to control your temper the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You pray and believe that God has forgiven you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You confess your sin to others, and your heart is once again filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You think that you will never lose your temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But a little later, you hear more unkind words and become upset once again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When these words come to you the second time, you begin to murmur within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By the third time, your temper explodes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Afterwards, you realize that you were wrong again, and you ask the Lord for forgiveness, promising Him that you will never lose your temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the same thing happens the next time you hear unkind words; after a while, your temper flares up again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You exercise your will again and again, only to find that you fail again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This proves that sin is not an accidental mistake; it is not something that happens only once.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is something that happens repeatedly, something that haunts you all your life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who lie continue to lie, and those who lose their temper continue to lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a law; no human power can overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul did not learn this lesson at first, so he exercised his will repeatedly to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is impossible for man to try to overcome the law of sin by his will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once the Lord grants you mercy and shows you that sin is a law, you will not be far from victory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you continue to think that sin is an occasional act and that victory can be secured through additional prayers and struggles against temptations, you are far from victory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul's story shows us that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The power of sin is strong; our own power is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The power of sin always prevails, while our own power always fails.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As soon as Paul realized that sin is a law, he knew that none of his methods would work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His determination was useless; he would never overcome the law of sin by his will.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This was a great discovery, a great revelation to him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul saw that a man cannot experience deliverance by the exercise of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As long as a man trusts in the power of his own will, he will not turn to God's way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The day will come when you will prostrate yourself before God and acknowledge that you can do nothing and henceforth will do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That will be the day you find deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only then will you understand Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brothers and sisters, please do not belittle Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must first have the knowledge of chapter seven before we can have the experience of chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The problem is not whether you understand the doctrine in Romans 8 but whether or not you have emerged from Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many have buried themselves in Romans 7; they are still trying to deal with sin by their will.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The result is nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you have not seen that sin is a law and that your will can never overcome this law, you are trapped in Romans 7; you will never arrive at Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our newly saved brothers and sisters must accept God's Word as it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you try to find your own way out, you will end up with nothing but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You will sin again and again, and your eyes will continue to be veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You will remain in your blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Your eyes need to be opened to see that all your willing and struggling is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Since sin is a law and the will cannot overcome this law, what is the way of victory?</S>
