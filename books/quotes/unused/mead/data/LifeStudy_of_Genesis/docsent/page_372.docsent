   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c Following the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After receiving and enjoying all these riches, Rebekah followed the servant, traveling through the desert on a camel until she met Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>58, 61-65 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, we are following the Spirit, traveling a long journey on a "camel."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we meet Christ, we shall dismount from our "camel."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the modern conveniences, such as telephones, automobiles, etc., are our "camels" today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rebekah traveled through the desert on top of a camel, and we are traveling through the desert on today's modern "camels."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Leviticus 11, a camel is unclean; yet it is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of today's conveniences are not clean in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, they enable us to travel through the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we meet Him, we shall leave the "camels."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>4 The Son's Marriage</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a good sense, the son, Isaac, did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that everything is planned by the Father and carried out by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the Son does is receive the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaac received Rebekah at eventide vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>63-64 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This implies that the marriage of Christ will be at the eventide of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the close of this age, Christ will come to meet His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent and loved her v. 67 . As we have seen, Sarah typifies grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, this means that Christ will meet us in grace as well as in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This chapter ends with the words, "Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I had been the writer, I would have said that Rebekah was comforted after her long journey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not consider your comfort, your satisfaction; rather, consider Christ's comfort, Christ's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Christ has no comfort and satisfaction, we cannot have any comfort and satisfaction either.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our satisfaction depends on His.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our comfort is His comfort, and His satisfaction is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is now waiting for His comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When will He have it?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the day of His marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That day will come.</S>
