   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AS THE TOPSTONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR GOD S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Zech 3:9; 4:7; Acts 4:10-12; John 1:42; Matt 16:18; 1 Pet 2:4-5; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:11, 18-19a THE CHURCH BEING THE REPRINT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SPIRIT WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that every one of us can have a clear vision of the church being the reprint of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is a reprint, a reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This has been missed in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christianity is merely a religion and a human organization; it is not the reprint of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s recovery today is the recovery of the church as the reprint of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason we have a burden that not only in one locality or in one country but in every locality and in every country there could be a living testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not depend on having a big number or a small number of people; rather, it depends on having some saints who meet together in the Lord s name, in the Lord s person, as Christ s reprint, Christ s reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us consider what the reprint of the Spirit with Christ really means.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all know what a reprint is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have an article that has been typeset, with every word correct and lacking nothing, all that is needed is to reprint the original on many sheets of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One original can be reproduced on thousands of sheets of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the meaning of a reprint.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is one and the Spirit is one, but the Spirit with Christ wants to reprint Christ onto the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever is in the original is also in every reprint, without different words or missing punctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is the reprint of Christ; it is a printed book of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What, then, is the content of this reprint?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The revelation in the Bible concerning this matter is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because it is not simple, the Bible uses figures to make it clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, the tabernacle as a type of God s dwelling place involves a great deal; if we do not have a picture but only use words, we cannot explain it thoroughly and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in His wisdom God gave us the tabernacle as a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we look at this picture, spontaneously we understand what God s dwelling place is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of representation is clearer than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church being the reprint of the Spirit with Christ cannot be clearly explained even with thousands of words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, there is a symbol in the Bible to show it, yet the symbol itself is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have seen that the golden lampstand apparently is simple, yet it is not simple when we really get into it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LAMPSTAND, JEHOVAH, THE LAMB, AND THE STONE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the previous chapter we mentioned four things: the lampstand, Jehovah, the Lamb, and the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have proved that the lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, and the Lamb is the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The key to our proof is the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of Jehovah Zech 4:2, 10 ; naturally, this shows that the lampstand is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jehovah with seven eyes equals the lampstand with seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible also says that the seven eyes of Jehovah are the seven eyes of the Lamb Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, this also proves that Jehovah is equal to the Lamb and the Lamb is equal to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, the Bible says that the seven eyes are the seven eyes of the stone Zech 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This proves that the stone is equal to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, the Bible says that the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we can say that the lampstand equals Jehovah, Jehovah equals the Lamb, the Lamb equals the stone, and the stone equals God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are seven lamps, seven eyes, and seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seven lamps belong to the lampstand, and the seven eyes belong to Jehovah, the Lamb, and the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seven eyes are also the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we put these few passages of the Bible together, we can definitely see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Based on this, the lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, the Lamb is the stone, and the stone is God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of saying may prick the ears of theologians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may ask, How can you say that the lampstand is Jehovah and that the stone is God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What kind of theology is this?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the authentic theology in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many theologians do not know the Bible; mostly they know traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not see God s direct revelation, the divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If, for example, the Lord Jesus had not said with His own mouth that the stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner Matt 21:42 , I am convinced that not one theologian would be willing to make such a statement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though the Lord Jesus did say this, today s theologians do not speak much about it because they do not understand it clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They do not know how the Lord Jesus can be a stone and how this stone can be the stone which was cut out without hands to smash the great image in Nebuchadnezzar s dream and eventually become a great mountain to fill the whole earth Dan 2:31-35 .</S>
