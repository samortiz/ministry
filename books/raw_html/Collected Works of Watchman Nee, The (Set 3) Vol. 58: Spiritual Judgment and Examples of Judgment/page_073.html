<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(53)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 4, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER K. K.</h2><p>I was greatly touched in 1928 when Brother Nee spoke on the story of Mary the Magdalene. I became clear concerning my salvation in 1932 when I heard Dr. John Sung speak on the Samaritan woman. For years I worked as a teacher but was weak and fraught with sickness. In 1935 I joined the Jin-Ning Bible College. I thought that the college was the highest Bible institution on earth. Later I had neuritis and became very sick. In my sickness I saw the transiency and vanity of human life. As a result, I was baptized in 1937. From that point forward my spiritual pathway had a turn. Later I read Rethinking the Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), and I saw the need to be clear about my calling. I was afraid that I was only a volunteer, so I decided to take up a teaching job instead. While on the mountain this time, I have seen the matter of authority as well as my need to submit to authority and to be under the discipline of the Holy Spirit. I am willing to commit myself to the Lord. If the Lord will grant me mercy, He will bring me through all my problems. Otherwise, even my pursuit of spirituality and my love for Him will amount to nothing.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister speaks quickly and softly. Being quick in speaking means that one's mind runs fast. It also means that too many thoughts are running through the mind. The mind is not calm, and the emotions are too strong. Our sister's obedience is based mostly on doctrines. Her mind is linked most readily to matters of doctrine because it is fast. But her spirit is not strong enough, and there is not enough discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>There are two kinds of obedience. First, there is obedience to the truth, and second, there is obedience to the Lord Himself. Although you spoke of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, you did not emphasize it. I advise you to pay more attention to this subject. Your mind is strong, and your understanding of the truth is strong. You also have a desire to obey the Lord, but your spirit does not match these attributes. Your spirit is not strong enough; it does not match your mind and emotions. Do not allow your mind and emotions to become too strong. Learn to make your spirit strong instead.</p><p>How can the spirit be strong? In order for the spirit to be strong, a man must have wounds. He must experience a breaking and a tearing down. Some experience some dealings, but there is no wound in them, and they do not have a feeling of hurt. Such ones cannot have a strong spirit.</p><p>There are two ways to know the Lord: in the mind and emotion or in the spirit. It is not enough just to know Him in the mind and emotion; one has to know Him in the spirit. If a man wants to serve the Lord properly, he has to know the Lord in the spirit. A man can direct his love for men toward loving the Lord, but it is not enough to love the Lord with an emotional love. He must touch something in his spirit; he must know the Lord according to the spirit. Hence, three things are needed: a strong mind, the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and knowing the Lord in the spirit.</p><p>In order to know men, we first must be rich in our own experience. When a brother has a problem, simply saying a few simple words to him will not work. First, we have to see the problem more clearly than he sees it. Next, we should render a helping hand. If he accepts it, we can lead him to the straight way. There are definite ways to know men. First, we have to be calm in ourselves. We must know the way ourselves before we can lead others to the way. We must be judged ourselves before we can judge others. I can deal with a person because what is happening to him was judged in me some years ago. A psychologist judges men only according to their words. However, we first must go through the inward dealings ourselves. After we have passed through these dealings, we will be sensitive to the same things when they surface in others. We may not be able to describe them, but inwardly we will be clear. Our judgment of others is based on our own condition.</p>
