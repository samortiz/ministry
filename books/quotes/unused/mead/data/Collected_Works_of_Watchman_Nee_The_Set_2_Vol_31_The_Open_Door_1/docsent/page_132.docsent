   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Bin-Jou, Shensi Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received The Open Door and was happy to see some news of brothers that I know, as well as the condition of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was called by the Lord two years ago, but because of my personal situation, I was slow to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I did not feel peaceful to remain in my work, but whenever I preached the gospel, my heart was filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I came to Pinchow to work in the government's Highway Engineering Office.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I wanted to quit twice to go preach the gospel, but I was not bold enough to quit and work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I often prayed to the Lord and debated with Him, saying, "If You do not want me to work, take away my job.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am not praying to submit to You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If You want me to do something, You do it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If You do not want me to do something, hinder me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lead me according to Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To my surprise the construction project was changed a few days later.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They stopped paving the road, so my job was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time I planned to go to Hankow via Ch'eng-tu.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I got to Brother Tze-sien's place, I intended to spend some time with the brothers in the Lord and be edified, as well as to learn some hymns and to understand more of the Bible, after which I would begin my work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, I felt that I would not be worthy to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later I felt in my heart that I should stay in Bin-Jou for two weeks because some at the Gospel Chapel wanted me to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Last year when I arrived in Bin-Jou, the American, Pastor Nieh, returned to his country, and I was called upon to help them in their meetings many times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I temporarily moved into the Gospel Chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A few days later the order came to prepare for the resumption of the construction project, and I had to stay for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Less than two weeks later, another order came to stop the work again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They wanted to transfer me to Bao-Ji to work on a bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The people at the Gospel Chapel cried aloud and tried to keep me there, so I prayed all night with four believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At three in the morning, the Lord told me, "If you are clear about giving up your work, tell them that you are quitting and come out quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I then decided to not work any longer, and the next day I quit my job.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the third day after I came to the Gospel Chapel, Sister Chang Sin-deh and Sister Tsou Hwei-deh received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chu Cheng-deh and Kuo Ming-deh received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit next.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tongues, prophecies, and spiritual songs which they uttered all had clear translations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With regard to the few people in the Gospel Chapel in Bin-Jou, other places had given them the name of Ice-Jou homonyms in Chinese .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was an exaggerated way of saying that they were cold to the point of being below zero degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The condition of the last few days and the Lord's blessing have proven that through one as humble, useless, foolish, and immature as I, the Lord's church has been helped.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, please pray for me and the church in Bin-Jou.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know that my condition and my work in the Lord are something that Brother Jung-jieh, Brother Tze-sien, and Brother Shou-ling would want to know about.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have just started walking in the Lord's way and am very immature, so I ask the brothers and sisters for advice to prevent me from taking the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like you to write to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With respect to the work of the Holy Spirit, I believe that tongue-speaking is something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is more important to be filled inwardly in the aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The filling of the Holy Spirit includes speaking in tongues, but those who speak in tongues do not always have the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I am wrong, please instruct me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peace in the Lord and greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have been in Nan-ch'ang for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our work is not busy, and we sometimes preach the gospel to the wounded soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although there is not much fruit, the Lord's word is never in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some have already believed seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I know that I am not faithful enough to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have let many good opportunities slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May God have mercy on me that I would be diligent and zealous for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We did not have any meetings until January 16 when the brothers and sisters here met together.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our unsaved friends sometimes attend too.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is one recent occurrence that is worthy of report.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sister Chou's elder brother was a zealous believer at one time, but he drifted away from God because of his environment and situation in recent years.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the beginning he never came to the meetings, but a month ago, Brother Chang prayed for him for quite awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We also remembered him in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He has returned to the Father through God's power and love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a prodigal son returns, even the angels rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We really need the prayers of the brothers and sisters to strengthen us to stand firm before God until the Prince of Peace returns.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We mention you constantly in our prayers and ask God to grant you special care.</S>
