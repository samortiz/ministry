[2]  This book is composed of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in the eleventh edification conference for the whole island of Taiwan from October 26 through November 4, 1958.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ETERNAL INTENTION BEING TO BUILD A HOUSE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:1, 8-9; 28:18-22; Exo 29:45-46; 40:1-2, 34-35; 2 Sam 7:1-16; 1 Kings 6:1, 11-13; 8:10-11; 9:1-3; Isa 66:1-2; 57:15; Psa 90:1; 91:1; 92:12-13; 27:4; 23:6; Jer 50:7b; John 1:14; 2:19-22; Matt 16:16-18; 1 Pet 2:5; Eph 2:20-22; 1 Cor 3:16; 6:19, 17; 1 John 4:13; Rev 21:2-3, 11-12, 14, 19a, 12, 22-23; 22:1-2a
[4]  The verses listed above nearly cover from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation.
[5]  All these verses are included at the beginning of this chapter because we need to see that the truths presented in this chapter are supported by the entire Bible.
[6]  When you read the Bible, at the beginning you see God's creation, but at the end of Revelation when you have finished reading it, what you see is the building of God.
[7]  I believe that the Holy Spirit enabled him to have some understanding of the meaning of this dream, which is that the God in heaven desires to enter into man on earth so that the earth and heaven may be joined and that man and God may dwell and live together.
[8]  Often at the end of our selfish and foolish prayers, we also have one or two sentences that are very clear.
[9]  We may often pray, "Lord, do this for me, and do that for me."
[10]  After the children of Israel entered Canaan, God repeatedly blessed them, giving them rest all around and enabling them to live in peace.
[11]  At that time, considering the question of a dwelling place for God, David their king said, "I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains" 2 Sam 7:2 .
[12]  In light of this, he decided to build a house for God.
[13]  I will first build a house for you, out of which a son will come forth, and it is he who will build a house for Me. I must first build you a house, and then you can do it for Me."
[14]  God always does things for man first, and then after this man can do things for God.
[15]  When the condition of the children of Israel before God was normal, God dwelt among them, and that temple was filled with the glory of God.
[16]  Please remember, however, that God wants us not only to be His dwelling place but also to take Him as our dwelling place.
[17]  If you read carefully about the godly people in the Old Testament, you will find out that the one thing they desired the most, the thing which gave them the most comfort and rest, was to dwell in the house of God.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO THE HOUSE BUILT UP BY GOD BEING THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN AS A MUTUAL ABODE Scripture Reading: Psa 90:1; 92:12-13; Luke 2:37; 1 Cor 6:17, 19a; 1 John 4:13; Rev 21:2-3
[19]  In the first chapter we saw that God wants to gain a house in the universe through His work of building so that both God and man can have a resting place.
[20]  We saw that after the completion of the work of creation the Bible says that God rested Gen 2:1-3 , yet in Isaiah 66:1 God says, "Heaven is My throne, / And the earth the footstool for My feet.
[21]  This word proves that although God created the heavens and the earth and has finished His work of creation, He has not obtained a resting place in the universe.
[22]  GOD'S BUILDING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THE TABERNACLE AND THE TEMPLE
[23]  We must ask the Lord to give us light to see that the building, the house, God wants to obtain in the universe is altogether not a physical house but a spiritual building of the mingling of God and man.
[24]  It is true that the Old Testament says that God dwelt in the tabernacle and then the temple, but that was only a symbol of God's union with the children of Israel.
[25]  In Isaiah God said clearly that heaven is His throne and the earth is His footstool and that the house which the children of Israel built for Him was not the place of His rest 66:1 .
[26]  God was united with the children of Israel and became one entity with them, and this one entity was a spiritual house in which both God and the godly people in Israel dwelt.
[27]  The church is neither solely human nor solely divine; rather, the church is the crystallization of the mingling of God and man.
[28]  CHAPTER THREE GOD'S BUILDING DEPENDING UPON THE GROWTH IN LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-12; 1 Cor 3:6-12; 1 Pet 2:2-5; Eph 2:21-22; 4:12-13, 15b-16; Col 2:19; Rev 22:1-2
[29]  After the first two chapters I hope that we are all clear about one thing: In this universe God desires to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself so that God and man may be mingled together to be one entity.
[30]  God desires that man's relationship with Him would not be characterized by man worshipping Him or doing things for Him; rather, God desires that man would take Him in as food so that He would be digested in man and become man's inner constitution.
[31]  God's purpose in coming into us in the form of food to be mingled with us as our life and to grow in us is to build a temple, which is the house of God.
[32]  Therefore, in the Scriptures we often see that growth and building are linked together.
[33]  GROWTH IN LIFE DEPENDING ON OUR GROWING UP INTO CHRIST IN ALL THINGS
[34]  In order to grow in life and be built together we must pay attention to this one thing growing up into Christ in all things.
[35]  Concerning the building of the church, Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things.
[36]  We have been saved, and we are in the Lord, but we have to confess that even up to the present, in many things we have not yet grown up into the Lord.
[37]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD'S BUILDING CAUSING MAN TO BE FULL OF CHRIST AND CAUSING CHRIST TO BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS HOME IN MAN'S HEART Scripture Reading: Col 2:19; Eph 3:17, 19b; 4:12-13 THE TWO ASPECTS OF GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE
[38]  In this chapter we would like to discuss the purpose of God's building in the universe.
[39]  To be used by God to accomplish His eternal purpose, it is not enough for man to be created; man still needs to receive God so that God may be mingled and united with him.
[40]  The tree of life not only signifies God, but even more it signifies the God who desires to be mingled with man by being life to man.
[41]  THE AMOUNT OF GOD'S BUILDING DETERMINING THE EXTENT TO WHICH GOD'S PURPOSE IS FULFILLED
[42]  From our experience we can see clearly that wherever there is a group of Christians who allow God to build in them in an extensive way, immediately there are two conditions among them.
[43]  GOD'S BUILDING RESULTING IN MAN'S GROWING WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD
[44]  We already said that God's building depends on our spiritual growth, and our spiritual growth comes from the increase of God in us.
[45]  Because God is constantly doing a constituting work in us, His element gradually increases in us.
[46]  GOD'S BUILDING RESULTING IN CHRIST BEING ABLE TO MAKE HIS HOME IN MAN
[47]  I would like to repeat again that this building is what is most needed among the children of God today.
[48]  CHAPTER FIVE GOD DESIRING ALL THE SAINTS TO BE BUILT TOGETHER Scripture Reading: Eph 2:21-22; 1 Cor 14:4-5, 12 GOD'S BUILDING BEING TO BUILD THE SAINTS TOGETHER
[49]  We have repeatedly stated that God's building is the building of God Himself into man and man into Himself.
[50]  God does not want only to build Himself into individual Christians or just to build individual Christians into Himself; rather, God's desire is to build Himself into us as a corporate entity and to build us corporately into Himself.
[51]  One of the crucial truths in the Scriptures is the building of the church.
[52]  GOD CARING NOT FOR MERE EDIFICATION BUT FOR BUILDING
[53]  We need to see clearly that God does not care for mere edification; He cares only for building.
[54]  God does not want some individual materials that look good; He wants a house.
[55]  God's intention is not to edify Christians individually to be an exhibition for people's appreciation; rather, His intention is to build many Christians together into a spiritual house to be the mutual dwelling place of God and man in which God and man can have rest.
[56]  CHAPTER SIX GOD'S BUILDING BEING THE REAL NEED OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 10-13; 3:3-12, 16-17; 12:18-27; 14:12 SEEING THE NEED FOR THE CHURCH TO BE BUILT UP
[57]  In the previous chapter we said that the church needs not only to be edified but also to be built up, which is a step further than being edified.
[58]  I really hope that after these messages God's children will all be able to see the need for the church to be built up and that they will have a deep feeling that no matter how much edification they have received in the past, they cannot become a dwelling place to satisfy the mutual need of God and man if they have not been built up.
[59]  For instance, chapter two speaks about our being redeemed and points out that we are being built together in the Lord into a dwelling place of God in spirit v. 22 . This indicates that the reason we were saved by God is so that He can build us into His dwelling place.
[60]  THE LACK OF THE BUILDED CHURCH ON EARTH TODAY
[61]  However, if you have the vision, if you have seen what God wants to have in eternity, you will sigh and say, "Today on the earth it is hard to find a church which has been built up!
[62]  It is hard to see a group of Christians who are being built up in a locality as a spiritual house in which God can dwell!"
[63]  Once someone asked me, "Brother Lee, Matthew 18 tells us that wherever two or three pray together in one accord, the Lord is there in their midst.
[64]  Two or three of us have been praying together and meeting together here, but why is it that there is not much of the Lord's presence among us?
[65]  BUILDING BEING THE GREATEST NEED OF THE CHURCH TODAY
[66]  We must see that all that matters is whether or not we have been built up.
[67]  Rather, it is a question of whether or not there is a group of people who have been built by God into a spiritual habitation in which God can dwell.
[68]  When people come into the midst of such a group, they not only sense the presence of God but also feel the warmth that is there.
[69]  Suppose a brother is going to a certain place to work for the Lord, and he only sees that he is going there to help the brothers and sisters to be spiritual.
[70]  He says, "Oh, the people there are fleshly; I want to go and help them so that they all may become spiritual.
[71]  THE ENTIRE BOOK OF 1 CORINTHIANS BEING ON THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH
[72]  Today many speak on 1 Corinthians, using it to present the matter of edification.
[73]  I would like to call your attention to a few things from the portions of the Word that are listed above.
[74]  1 In Revelation 21:11 we see that the glory in the holy city, New Jerusalem, is the glory of God and that the light of the city is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone.
[75]  2 In Revelation 21 jasper is mentioned three times: the first time is in verse 11, which says that the light of the city is like a jasper stone; the second time is in verse 18, which says that the building work of the wall of the city is jasper; and the third time is in verse 19, which says that among the twelve foundations of the wall, the first foundation is jasper.
[76]  BEING BUILT TOGETHER WITH OTHERS IN THE CHURCH AND ABSOLUTELY NOT BEING INDIVIDUALISTIC
[77]  We should not think that as long as we are spiritual and as long as we pursue God individually, we will be all right.
[78]  Now we will go on to see how we can know that a church has been built up.
[79]  In other words, what is the condition of a built up church?
[80]  In the New Jerusalem there is the throne of God.
[81]  Sometimes when you go to a certain place and meet some brothers and sisters there, you can sense that among them there is not the throne of God but the throne of man.
[82]  A BUILDED CHURCH HAVING THE FLOW AND SUPPLY OF LIFE
[83]  The Scriptures show us that there is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne, and on both sides of the river there is the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, and yielding its fruits each month Rev 22:1-2 .
[84]  The city has God Himself and the Lamb as its temple, the throne of God and of the Lamb, and the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne with the tree of life yielding the fruits of life abundantly.
[85]  However, wherever there is a group of saints who have passed through the building work of the Holy Spirit so that they have become one, you will sense the presence of God and the throne of God among them.
[86]  In addition, each one of the twelve gates is a pearl 21:21a .
[87]  In this situation there is the need for a pearl gate.
[88]  This gate shuts out all the naturalness of man.
[89]  A BUILDED CHURCH NEEDING TO BE FULL OF GOD'S NATURE
[90]  The New Jerusalem also has a street Rev 21:21b .
[91]  The street of pure gold is always connected to the gates of pearl.
[92]  Without the gates of pearl, it would be difficult to find the street of pure gold.
[93]  Therefore, the Word of God shows us that if we want to be part of the building of the church, we have to enter in through the pearl gates; that is, we need to pass through the cross and be dealt with by God.
[94]  In the last chapter we saw that the gates of the New Jerusalem are pearls.
[95]  In addition, Revelation 21 tells us that the wall of the city has twelve foundations vv.
[96]  Furthermore, the wall of the city is altogether built with precious stones Rev 21:18a .
[97]  If we want to be truly built up, we not only need to be broken by God, but we also need to allow God to do a constituting work in us.
[98]  But one thing is for sure: after you are saved, if you allow God to do some building work in you, and if you allow the Holy Spirit to do some constituting work in you, then a wall will be built up as a separating line in you, and you will instantly see that movies are separated from you forever.
[99]  I would like to ask you, when you went to watch even the best movie, could you say that God was in you, that God was with you, and that He was sitting there with you?
[100]  We still have to address the twelve foundations of the wall.
[101]  CHAPTER TEN A FEW PRINCIPLES FOR PRACTICING THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Acts 9:31; Eph 4:11, 16; 6:10-11; Neh 4
[102]  Although there is still much to cover concerning God's building, we will conclude with this chapter.
[103]  In doing so, we would like to mention several important points that serve as principles for us to keep in the practical building up of the church.
[104]  First, we would like to see how the building of God proceeds in the church age.
[105]  History tells us, however, that God's enemy, Satan, comes in to undermine God's work in many ways.
[106]  The most obvious way is to bring in divisions in the church.
[107]  Today no matter where we are, we see that the church is divided.
[108]  At this point in history we surely have to thank the Lord.
[109]  Over the past thirty years He has truly granted us grace and has led us into the way that is according to His heart, enabling us to bear His testimony in each locality in a pure way.
[110]  I would like to relate to you a story that happened many years ago in the church in Shanghai.
[111]  A brother came to the leading brothers and asked us to transfer him so that he could serve in another hall.
[112]  His reason was that in the hall he was in there was a brother whom he could not stand, and there was also a sister whom he could not bear.
[113]  THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH REQUIRING THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE MEMBERS
[114]  Second, everyone who is being built up in a local church must learn to exercise his function.
[115]  THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH NEEDING THE WORKERS TO PERFECT THE SAINTS INSTEAD OF REPLACING THEM
[116]  Third, the co-workers and responsible ones have to see a great principle in Ephesians 4.
[117]  In the building of the church the gifted persons are meant to perfect the saints so that they will become useful ones.
[118]  ALL MINISTRIES BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH, AND THE CHURCH NOT BEING REQUIRED TO BE FOR ANY MINISTRY
[119]  We always stress that as mentioned in Ephesians 4, the work of those who have a ministry, of those who are especially gifted, is to perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[120]  If the brothers and sisters in a locality all exercise their functions, if the co-workers and responsible brothers and sisters do not replace the saints but rather perfect them to serve together with them, if all those with a ministry are for the building of the church, and if all the saints are holding weapons, fighting a spiritual warfare by their fighting prayers while doing the building work together, then you will see a glorious church being built up in that locality.
