<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE HISTORY<br />
OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH</h1>
<h1 class="msg">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Chron. 11:5-23; 13:1-21; 14:6&mdash;15:15; 17:1-19; 19:1&mdash;20:30</h1>
<p>The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles are supplements to the other books of history in the Old Testament. In 1 Chronicles there is, first, a supplement to the history of mankind, for 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings do not include the genealogy of mankind, which is found in 1 Chronicles 1&mdash;9. In the previous message we covered the supplement to the history of David. In this message we will begin to consider the supplement to the history of the kings of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. OF REHOBOAM</h2>
<p>In 2 Chronicles 11:5-23 we have a word concerning the reign of Rehoboam.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Capable and Wise</h2>
<p>Rehoboam was capable and wise (v. 23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Not Laboring for God&rsquo;s Interest on the Earth</h2>
<p>Although Rehoboam was capable and wise, he did not labor for God&rsquo;s interest on the earth to build up the kingdom of God. Instead, he worked for his own interest, transmuting the kingdom of God into a monarchy not only for himself but also for his descendants (vv. 22-23). For this he lost the greater part of his kingdom. The kingdom of his father Solomon was glorious and splendid, but not long after Rehoboam began to reign, he lost nearly the entire kingdom. This loss was due to his failure to labor for God&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. His Way and Condition Not Being Proper</h2>
<p>Rehoboam&rsquo;s kingdom was on the proper ground of oneness according to God&rsquo;s choice of a unique place (Deut. 12:13-14), and he was fundamental and not apostate, but the way he took and the condition he worked out were not proper. He remained on the proper ground in Jerusalem and he believed and kept the teachings of Moses according to God&rsquo;s revelation. He did not leave God&rsquo;s truth and God&rsquo;s speaking, but he labored for his own interest, not for God&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>All the elders should pay attention to this. Elders, you are on the proper ground and you may be fundamental, but for what are you laboring? Are you laboring for God&rsquo;s interest or for your own interest? If you are for your interest, you make the local church a monarchy, your own little empire, not a part of the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Priests and the Levites throughout<br />
All Israel Abandoning Their Property<br />
and Going to Judah and Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Due to the proper ground of Rehoboam&rsquo;s kingdom and his fundamental faith, the priests and the Levites throughout all Israel abandoned their property and went to Judah and Jerusalem. Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts to seek Jehovah came with the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice (that is, to offer their offerings) to the God of their fathers, thus strengthening the kingdom of Judah and supporting Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years (vv. 13-17). Taking the proper ground and keeping the fundamental faith attracted the seekers of God, and they went to Jerusalem to join Rehoboam for the kingdom of God. However, actually he was not for the kingdom of God; he was for his own monarchy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Rehoboam Indulging His Sexual Lust</h2>
<p>Rehoboam indulged his sexual lust by taking eighteen wives and sixty concubines and begetting twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters, and he sought for his sons many wives (vv. 21, 23). This brought in corruption to them, to their descendants, and to their monarchy. Although Rehoboam took the proper ground and was fundamental, he lived a life of the indulgence of lust. In this matter he was surely influenced by his father, who had hundreds of wives and concubines.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
