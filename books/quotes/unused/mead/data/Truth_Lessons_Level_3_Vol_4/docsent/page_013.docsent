   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joyful toward God in the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lastly, to live the kingdom life in the church we need to live a joyful life toward God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have no joy, this indicates that we have failed and are not in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we truly live the kingdom life, we will be joyful toward God and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our living is righteous toward ourselves and peaceful toward others, we will have joy toward God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the kingdom will be manifested in our daily life in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>E. Working for the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Colossians 4:11 the apostle Paul told the saints in Colossae that his co-workers were fellow workers for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that their work in the gospel for the establishing and building up of the churches was for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the reality of the kingdom of God is the reality of the church in the present age and that what the apostle and his co-workers did was to establish and build up churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>F. Partaking of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Revelation 1:9 says, I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse clearly indicates that today we are partakers of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John knew that he was in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To him, the kingdom was not only for a future age but was a present reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, he could say that he was a fellow partaker in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kingdom is the kingdom that we have entered through regeneration John 3:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without being regenerated into God s kingdom, we would have no way to be fellow partakers in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having been regenerated into the kingdom, we should remain in it, partaking of the kingdom by accepting the heavenly ruling of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, in Revelation 1:9, in regard to the kingdom, John said that he is our brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that for tribulation and the kingdom, endurance is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To endure the tribulation related to the kingdom, we need the endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Tribulation</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 5:10-12 the Lord Jesus said that His believers would suffer persecution for the sake of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we suffer for the sake of righteousness, we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we are in the kingdom, the more we will suffer and be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, being in the kingdom today is not a matter of glory but a matter of bearing reproach and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we are fellow partakers in the kingdom of Jesus, we are not yet co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He comes back, we shall be His co-kings in the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That will be the time of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, today is not a day of reigning but a day of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At present, we are not in the reigning aspect of the kingdom but in the suffering aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason Paul and Barnabas told the disciples, Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tribulations they spoke of were mainly due to persecution from the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All believers in Christ experience persecution from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If there were no religion in the world today, we would not suffer much persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most trouble, persecution, and opposition can be traced back to one source religion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While we suffer, we are in the kingdom, a realm in which we are being exercised, trained, and prepared so that we may be qualified to reign in the kingdom of Christ as His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kingdom of God was the main subject of the apostles preaching in Acts 8:12; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The kingdom of God is not a material kingdom visible to human sight but a kingdom related to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life in His believers, forming a realm in which God rules through His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself Luke 17:21 as the seed of life sown into His believers Mark 4:3, 26 and developing into a realm that God rules as His kingdom through the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To enter into the kingdom of God is to enter into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the whole world opposes God s people entering into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Throughout the centuries religion, in particular, has been utilized by God s enemy to keep God s people from entering into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason we must experience many tribulations to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should expect opposition and be prepared for it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, in all the tribulations we must endeavor to enter into the realm of the full enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we have the enjoyment of such a Christ, we will be under the divine rule.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way, we will become the kingdom of God, which is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The kingdom of God is the church life, and the church life is the realm of the enjoyment of the resurrected and ascended Christ.</S>
