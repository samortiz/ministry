   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE WORKS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE BENEFIT OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Date: November 19, 1935, 3 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Chuenchow THE WORKS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show us that there are only three works of the Holy Spirit: 1 imparting life to man, 2 becoming life within man, and 3 becoming power upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three things include all the works of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first work of the Holy Spirit is to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second is to live in man to be life to him, and the third is to come upon man to empower him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These three aspects encompass all the works of the Holy Spirit as described in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Old Testament only has the first and third aspects; it does not have the second aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament, we do not find the Holy Spirit dwelling within man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament is the Holy Spirit dwelling within man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were men in the Old Testament who touched life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, David touched life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition to the first aspect of the work of the Spirit, we also find the outpouring of the Spirit in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, it was only experienced by a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, during the building of the tabernacle, the Spirit fell upon Aholiab and Bezaleel and gave them wisdom to devise cunning works and to build the tabernacle Exo 31:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moses also received the Spirit upon him, and he distributed the Spirit to seventy elders Num 11:17, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many prophets also received the Spirit of God upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was, however, uncommon for the Spirit of God to fall upon a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Very few recognized prophets had an experience of the Spirit of God falling upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many of the prophets also had disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Elisha had many disciples, but none of them received the Spirit upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the book of Judges speaks of people receiving the Spirit and doing extraordinary things, the number was small Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old Testament only Judges 6:34 appears to indicate that the Spirit dwelt within man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the original text, however, this verse does not say that the Spirit dwelt within man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It only indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah was clothed with Gideon, as though Gideon was a garment and the Holy Spirit was within this garment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Other than this instance, there is no place in the Old Testament which indicates the Spirit dwelling within man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, the Holy Spirit also came upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We see this in Mary, Zachariah, John the Baptist, and the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time the Spirit had not dwelt within man and was not yet life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was not until John 14:16-17 that the Holy Spirit did this new work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please note the words "shall be" in the last part of verse 17; it does not say "has been."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was a brand new thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit would abide in man and be with man forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unlike the Old Testament, which had only the first and third aspects of the Spirit's work, the Holy Spirit began a new work in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was no longer just coming upon man or giving life to man, but He was dwelling within man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the Lord's ascension He gave His disciples two great promises.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first was given before His death, and the second was given before His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first promise was that the Holy Spirit would abide in man John 14:17 , and the second promise was that the Holy Spirit would come upon man Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus we have the three aspects of the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are a Chinese reader, you may not know how precious this matter is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are a Jew, the biblical expression "abiding in you" will be a strange concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, and Jeremiah did not have the Holy Spirit abiding in them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Old Testament only says that the Spirit of Jehovah was upon a person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only Genesis 6:3 uses the expression "within man."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Translator's Note: This is according to the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, in the original language, this verse says, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It does not say that the Holy Spirit was dwelling within those in Genesis 6:3.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It merely says that the Spirit would no longer strive with man or grieve man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Old Testament speaks of the Spirit, it always uses the word upon, but the New Testament always uses the word in. This promise is too wonderful the Holy Spirit would abide within man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Word becoming flesh was a wonderful event that occurred in the Lord Himself, but the Spirit Himself living in the believers is an even more wonderful event.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When did the Spirit begin to abide in man?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 14:17 the Lord said that the Spirit "shall be" in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This word was spoken prior to the Lord's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 20:22, He breathed a holy breath into the disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This happened after the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After His resurrection, the Holy Spirit came and the disciples received the Lord's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Holy Spirit was the Lord's breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is like God's breathing of the breath of life into the nostrils of Adam after he was created out of the dust of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The result was that he became a living soul Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is happening to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord is breathing the Holy Spirit, the breath of life, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without a breath from God, man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without a breath from the Lord to the church, the church is also dead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the second aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After we know the history of the work of the Spirit, we will understand our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The promise of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the disciples was fulfilled on the day of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Forty days after the Lord's resurrection, He promised the disciples again that they would receive the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This promise of the Lord was fulfilled at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In comparison, which of these promises is better?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the Old Testament, the outpouring of the Spirit was the special privilege of a few, such as the priests, prophets, or judges.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There might have been only one person in the whole nation of Israel who had this privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It might only have been the king or some special person who had this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The rest had to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the Old Testament history, we find this kind of man appearing only once every few decades or centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such events were rare.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But in the New Testament, everyone can and should have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This promise is very unique; it is something that we can all receive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is a special blessing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What a joy that we can all have the Spirit upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Before His ascension, the Lord charged the disciples to remain in Jerusalem and wait for the promise Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By that time the disciples already had the indwelling life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They heard the Lord's word and were praying and waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Ten days later at Pentecost, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Everyone who reads Acts 2 knows that this speaks of the Holy Spirit's outward work upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Gospel of Luke also speaks of this outward aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It does not refer to the inward working of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>From John, Luke, and Acts, we see that there are two lines to the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One line is within man, and the other is outside of man.</S>
