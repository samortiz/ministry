   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIN OF JEROBOAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN TYPOLOGY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the death of Solomon, the kingdom of David was divided.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to the degradation of Solomon, ten of the twelve tribes were lost to Jeroboam, who established another kingdom 1 Kings 11:29-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From that time onward, the children of Israel were two separate kingdoms the kingdom of Judah to the south and the kingdom of Israel to the north.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The worship center chosen by God, however, was not divided; it was still one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The kingdom may be divided, but the center of God s testimony could not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jeroboam was very concerned about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Probably deep in his heart, he said, If these ten tribes continue going to Jerusalem to worship the Lord, they may be influenced to kill me and to return to the house of David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, Jeroboam set up two other worship centers, one in Bethel and one in Dan, for the convenience of his people 1 Kings 12:26-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jeroboam seemed to be saying to the people in a subtle way: It is too far for you to travel to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not at all convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have set up two other worship centers for you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now you don t need to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may go either to Dan or to Bethel to worship your God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also is very significant in typology.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The significance of Jeroboam s sin can be seen in practice in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Certain pastors and so-called Christian workers desire to have an empire under their control.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to have their own kingdom, they, like Jeroboam, establish their own worship centers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jeroboam did not have the real God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having made two calves of gold, Jeroboam said, Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt 1 Kings 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you think that no one would have been so foolish as to follow such a blind guide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But many Christians are this foolish today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as Jeroboam had God only in name, some of the things that are called God in the worship centers today are simply God in name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, it is not God it is a calf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jeroboam surely had no heart for God; his heart was for himself and for his empire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He not only set up those two idols, but he also had the boldness to build a house of high places 1 Kings 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Hebrew word for house in this verse is the same word for the house of the Lord, referring to the temple 1 Kings 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, Jeroboam built a temple on the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, there are many high places in Christianity upon which people build temples in the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, these temples are not built purely for God, but also for the ambition of those who build them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many so-called Christian workers also treasure the particular names they keep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because they want to maintain control over their empire, they do not call themselves by a common term, but by a particular name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they took a common name, their empire would be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their names are unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot find in the Bible the names they use.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In principle, some of their deeds are the same as those of Jeroboam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE RETURN FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Babylonian captivity, God told His people to return from Babylon to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He seemed to be saying, Get out of your captivity and get into My recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although not all the children of Israel returned, a number did go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ezra was a leader among those who had returned, and the book of Ezra is the book of return from Babylon to Jerusalem, from captivity to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who returned to Jerusalem rebuilt the temple and later the wall of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you know the significance of this point?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Surely this matter is important.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we believe that Genesis 1:26 is God s word, then we must also believe that this point is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The question is how to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We apply the Passover to Christ, the crossing of the Red Sea to baptism, the manna to Christ as our food, the tabernacle to Christ, the altar to the cross of Christ, and the furniture in the tabernacle and the temple to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we would apply all the points we have considered thus far in this message, we must be very sober and not listen to the superficial talk of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many critics say that it is not fair for us to claim that we are the church and that they are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They say, Is it fair for you to say that you are the church and that we are not?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are we not Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Have we not been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Don t we love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are we not here serving the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is not our work for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then why do you call yourselves the church and say that we are not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not presume that you cannot be misled by such superficial talk.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Apparently, such talk is quite logical; actually, it is altogether unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I admit that there are many genuine Christians who truly love the Lord and have a heart to serve the Lord, but they are still in captivity and have not returned to the proper ground.</S>
