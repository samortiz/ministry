   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, He laid down His life which means that He died.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the three days after His death He was taking His life back again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had the ability to lay down His life and He also had the ability to take His life back again because He was the resurrection, and resurrection always rises up.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Jesus rose up, that was God within Him rising up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Triune God was fully involved in the resurrection of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Jesus was rising up, God was within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because Jesus was born of the divine essence intrinsically, God was in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the conception of Jesus, God became His very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when He was a babe in the manger He was the mighty God Isa 9:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Life is the Triune God and resurrection is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since the Triune God was the intrinsic essence of Jesus, the intrinsic essence of Jesus was also resurrection itself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Death cannot overcome resurrection, but it is so easy for resurrection to overcome death.</S>
