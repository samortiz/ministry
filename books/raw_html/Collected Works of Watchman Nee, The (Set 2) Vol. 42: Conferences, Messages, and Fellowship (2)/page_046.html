<h2 class="head1">OBEDIENCE BEING BETTER THAN SACRIFICE,<br />AND HEARKENING THAN THE FAT OF RAMS</h2><p>Verse 22 is very precious. This word is too good. Samuel said, "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." The fat of rams adds sweet aroma to the sacrifices and delights the Lord. A sacrifice is a loss to us and a gain to God. When a man offers a sacrifice, he loses something. Putting a sacrifice on the altar is a loss; it is to sacrifice oneself in order that God would gain something. A sacrifice is for man to suffer, to deny himself, and to give his best to the Lord. Yet God said that no sacrifice can replace obedience, and no work can replace our hearkening. The problem with us is that we can do everything but obey. Man thinks that he can offer up sacrifices that are better than obedience. Yet God treasures obedience and hearkening.</p><p>Even if we can do many works for God, and even if we can sacrifice, labor, suffer, and deny ourselves, none of these things can replace obedience and hearkening. Many people work laboriously and unceasingly in order to replace obedience with sacrifices. They think that as long as they work unceasingly and continuously, they can make up for their lack in obedience. The only thing they will not do is to stop and obey. Such ones can never hope to please God. I know only one thing&mdash;nothing can replace obedience.</p><p>Ten years ago I was with Miss Barber on a hill in Pai-Ya-Tan. We spent three hours walking together. On our way back I asked, "Many people say that you like to hike. Is that true?" She asked, "What do they say?" I said, "They say that they see you hiking all the time." She said, "It is easy for me to stop hiking. I have been away from England for over ten years, and I do not intend to go back. I intend to die here. Every day I like to take a little walk. I prayed about it and became clear that this is what the Lord wants me to do. It would be easy for me to avoid this criticism of my hiking, but if this is what God wants me to do, it would be hard for man to stop me from doing it."</p><p>I noticed that Miss Barber had better food than many unbelievers, and I mentioned this to her. She said, "My friend, it is not a question of eating well or not eating well. It is just as easy for me to eat well as to not eat well. But I pray over every dollar that I spend on my food every month. God takes responsibility for my food and for how good it is; I am not responsible for it." God's will is better than our sacrifice. We may think that sacrifice and sufferings are good. We may think that everything will be all right as long as we offer good things to God. But what does God say? Our mind does not need to worry about what to do for God. All we have to do is to obey His commandment.</p><h2 class="head1">"YET NOT AS I WILL, BUT AS YOU WILL"</h2><p>Before the Lord's departure from the world, He prayed the last night in the garden of Gethsemane. Many people think that the Lord was sorrowful and that His sweat became like great drops of blood because His flesh was weak and He was afraid of the cup. No! Listen to what the Lord said: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" (Matt. 26:39). The Lord asked that the cup be removed from Him if it were possible. Yet He prayed that it would not be according as He willed but as the Father willed. The Lord could ask for the cup to be removed from Him, but He could not ask for God's will to be removed. He could ask for the passing away of the cup of the cross, but He could not ask for the passing away of God's will. The Lord was not dealing with the matter of crucifixion but with the matter of God's will. He desired to be one with God's will. It was all right with Him whether or not the cup was taken away. All He asked for was God's will. Many times we pay attention only to the bitter cup; we think that suffering is always good and that sacrifice and labor are always good. Yet the cup is good only when it is linked to God's will. If the cup is separated from God's will, the cup has no value to it. After the Lord was clear that God's will was for Him to take the cup, He took it willingly. Before the Lord was clear that the cup was God's will, He could pray for the cup to go away. But when He was clear that it was God's will, He took it without any hesitation.</p><p>We must live for God's will, not for the sacrifices. May the Lord shine on us thoroughly so that we realize that nothing of us will ever please God. Only that which is done according to God's commandment will please God. Do not think that everything will be all right as long as we live for Him, consecrate to Him, and suffer for His sake. We must ask if this living, consecration, and suffering are God's will. The Amalekites, the sheep, the oxen, and Agag are all useless on God's altar. The sacrifice which God wants on the altar must be something that God Himself designates. Everything else is the flesh and only deserves to die; it is not worthy to be put on the altar. May the Lord open our eyes to see that we can offend the Lord not only in sinful things, but also in offering sacrifices. May the Lord forbid us from offering what He has not designated, and may He direct us to do only that which is according to His will.</p>
