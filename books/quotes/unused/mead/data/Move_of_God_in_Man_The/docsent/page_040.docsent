   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the things related to our physical body are mysterious and not able to be fully understood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In light of this, consider how much more difficult it is to understand the mysterious death and burial of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ died in the flesh but still lives in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this renewed, empowered, and strengthened spirit He went down to Hades, where the rebellious angels at Noah's time were imprisoned, to proclaim to them how God had achieved the victory through Him in His death.</S>
