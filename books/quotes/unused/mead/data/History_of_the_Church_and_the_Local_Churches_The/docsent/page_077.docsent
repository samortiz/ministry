   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At that time my family was still in northern China, so I had to return.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of the invasion of the Japanese army, I could not leave my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, Brother Nee and I were separated for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I stayed in northern China, and most of the co-workers remained in the interior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through my experiences in traveling and speaking to many denominations, I realized that there was very little result.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That caused me to make a decision not to travel anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, I would stay in Chefoo to build up the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1938 Brother Nee went to England and stayed there for one and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was also invited to visit some of the Scandinavian countries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He returned to Shanghai in 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That summer he had a conference on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I received a cable from him asking me to attend this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I brought four young co-workers with me to this conference in August 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through this conference we received a vision of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1940 he began to have a series of trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During that time he also had a conference in Shanghai about every two months.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, he spoke every Wednesday evening concerning the Body of Christ and God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time I saw the blueprint of the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I took this blueprint back with me to Chefoo, and for about two years we practiced what Brother Nee had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This brought in a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Meanwhile, there was a big turmoil in Shanghai in 1942, forcing Brother Nee to stop his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This rebellious turmoil and the persecution of the Japanese army caused the church in Shanghai to close down.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While the church in Shanghai was passing through this turmoil, there was a revival in Chefoo with the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, I was put into prison by the Japanese army for one month.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I was released from prison, I became sick with tuberculosis on the lungs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord brought me through this illness within two and a half years, and after the war I was invited to come to Shanghai in 1946.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was there that Brother Nee and I met together again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We had been away from each other for more than six years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we had not had any correspondence during that time, I was concerned about whether what we had practiced in northern China was right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I presented everything that we had practiced in those years to Brother Nee, and he encouraged me to bring the same practice to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I began to minister in Shanghai again, and there was a revival there in 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through this revival, as I have pointed out previously, Brother Nee's ministry was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When his ministry was recovered, there was an even bigger, broader revival among us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, about eighty to one hundred saints attended a six-month training with him in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After that period of training, the trainees went to many cities, spreading the revival throughout China.</S>
