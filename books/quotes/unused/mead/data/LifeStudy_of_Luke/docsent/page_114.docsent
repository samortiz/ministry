   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Teaching concerning Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 17:7-10 we have the Lord s teaching about service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 7 through 9 He says, Now which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at the table?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after this you shall eat and drink?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does he thank the slave because he did the things which were directed?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that the slave, after plowing or tending sheep, should not expect to be highly praised for his work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is still necessary for him to go to the kitchen, prepare food for his master, and serve him so that he may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After all this, the slave should realize that he is unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the Lord concludes, So also you, when you do all the things which you are directed, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done v. 10 . I appreciate the point the Lord makes in 17:7-10, for it strengthens us in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Seriousness of Offending Others</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the church life, the church service, and the Lord s ministry it is a very serious thing to offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes it seems that we can accomplish a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, we may tear down more than we build up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the result of stumbling others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young I was given the following admonition: Don t do the Lord s work in such a way that you build up one foot and then tear down a foot and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to this admonition, it is possible for us first to build up and then to tear down more than what we have built up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what some who are serving the Lord are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, they have done much for the Lord; on the other hand, simultaneously they have torn down a great deal, even more than they have built up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to learn from this not to stumble others and thereby tear down what has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We always need to be careful and cautious not to hurt others, not to offend others, and not to stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ready and Willing to Forgive</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are offended by someone, we need to be ready and willing to forgive that one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we shall not have problems with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, on the one hand, some servants of the Lord stumble others, and, on the other hand, are easily offended by others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, they are always having problems with people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Either they stumble others, or they are offended by others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should try not to stumble others, but always be ready and willing to forgive anyone who may offend us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you know what it means to forgive?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To forgive means not to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Lord s word in 17:4, even if a brother sins against us seven times a day, we should always be ready to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As soon as we forgive someone, we shall not be offended by him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if we do not forgive, we shall be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The point here is that forgiving annuls offending.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not forgive others, we shall be offended by them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we forgive them, we shall annul the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a certain brother offends you, and you forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your forgiving of him will annul his offending of you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then there will be no problem between you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, suppose this brother offends you, and you are not willing to forgive him and forget the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will cause trouble, especially to you, for you will become entangled as the result of being offended.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we should avoid stumbling others, and we should also avoid being offended by others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should always be careful and cautious not to offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, we should always be willing to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exercising Faith and Realizing</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That We Are Not Useful</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to being careful not to offend and being ready to forgive, we need to exercise faith in God under all kinds of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to believe that whatever happens to us is of God and that He is sovereign and is taking care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we exercise our faith in God, we need to do everything we can for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet we need to realize that we are not useful, that we are not profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, we need to humble ourselves before the Lord with the attitude that we are not profitable servants.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do these things, we shall be preserved in usefulness under the hand of the Lord.</S>
