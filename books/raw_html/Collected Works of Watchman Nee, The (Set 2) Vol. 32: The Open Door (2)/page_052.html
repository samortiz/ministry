If need be, I will move the teachers and students to Szechuan. I also have the burden to take the children with me to Yunnan to pioneer that place and to organize a new community. This is a big task, and I look to the Lord for His guidance and blessing. I ask that my work be published in The Open Door so that the brothers and sisters can pray for me. I will not need any offering because there is support from special funds. (Brother Yen is from Honan. He studied in the Methodist seminary in Che-Kou. He has given himself to this charitable work for the love of the Lord. We should remember him always in our prayer&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>(2) Brother Liu Tien-min from Chou County wrote in his letters on June 20 and 30: "Brother Chan has taken refuge in the west of the county township.
