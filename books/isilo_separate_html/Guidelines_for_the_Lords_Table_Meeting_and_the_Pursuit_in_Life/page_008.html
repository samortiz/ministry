IN THE COURSE OF A MEETING</h2>
<p>In the entire course of a meeting we need different hymns for different sections of a meeting. For example, we may have ten kinds of hymns to meet the need of different sections of the meeting. The first hymn should be an opening hymn. After the opening hymn we should lead the saints into the subject of the meeting. Hence, the second hymn should be an introductory hymn that brings the entire meeting to its central subject. Sometimes, if there may not have been a strong release of the spirit of a hymn, there is the need for a third kind of hymn, a strengthening hymn. At such a time we need to strengthen the spirit. But if the strengthening hymn is not sufficient, we will need a fourth kind of hymn that can uplift the spirit. However, a hymn for uplifting the spirit does not necessarily have to follow a strengthening hymn. A fifth kind of hymn is a turning hymn. When someone selects the wrong hymn and the singing begins to drag, there is the need to turn by selecting another hymn. For example, in a meeting where everyone senses the Lord&rsquo;s greatness and exaltedness, a brother may select a gospel hymn. At such a time there is the need for someone to select another hymn immediately. A sixth kind of hymn, similar to a turning hymn, is a correcting hymn. For example, someone may select a hymn about praising the Lord after the bread and cup have been passed. At this time someone should correct this choice by selecting a hymn related to the worship of the Father. A seventh kind of hymn maintains the spirit. If the meeting has not reached its conclusion, there is the need to maintain the spirit of the meeting. An eighth kind of hymn fills the gap and adjusts the length of a meeting. Sometimes if the meeting is too long and needs some adjustment, someone can adjust it with a hymn. The ninth kind of hymn is a concluding hymn, and the tenth kind of hymn is a lingering hymn, a hymn for lingering before sending people off. Sometimes a meeting has ended, yet it seems that the meeting is still not over; at such times there is the need for a &ldquo;sending off&rdquo; hymn. This is based on Genesis 18. When Abraham was reluctant to let Jehovah go, he walked a distance with Him to send Him off (v. 16).</p>
<p>An opening hymn serves two purposes. First, it calms the saints&rsquo; hearts. Often our hearts are not settled when we walk into a meeting. The singing of a hymn can calm our hearts. Second, an opening hymn allows time for all the saints to arrive. The second hymn should bring the saints&rsquo; hearts into the central subject of a meeting. In short, because the first hymn is for the preparation of the saints&rsquo; hearts, the singing should be living. But we should not go too high too fast; rather, we should sing verse by verse to calm the saints&rsquo; hearts so that they may be brought into the presence of God. Hence, no matter what kind of meeting we are in, we can select a longer hymn for the first one. The second hymn brings the saints into the central subject of a meeting, leading them into the spirit of a meeting.</p>
<p>Suppose in a prayer meeting we sense that the atmosphere is for the spreading of the gospel; we should not select a hymn that does not have the flavor of prayer. Even though a hymn of encouragement can be used in ministering the Word or in encouraging the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, it is not appropriate in a prayer meeting. Therefore, if we select the wrong hymn, it will be difficult to go on in the meeting. If we are not familiar with the hymns and expect to be inspired by the Holy Spirit, we are waiting for a miracle. Hence, a knowledge of the hymns and the selection of hymns are very important.</p>
<p>An opening hymn should be long enough for the spirit of the saints to be fanned into flame. If a hymn is not long enough, the saints will not be sufficiently &ldquo;pumped up&rdquo; in their spirit; they will be like those who are out of breath when they run home from the street and go directly to the dining table. In order for the opening hymn to stir up and uplift the spirit of the saints, the tune must be powerful, and it must be easy to sing; moreover, the lyrics should be of adequate length. For instance, <em>Hymns,</em> #213 is a good hymn for beginning the table meeting. If all the brothers and sisters sense that the Lord is full of glory and honor, then they can sing <em>Hymns,</em> #127, and continue with <em>Hymns,</em> #183. To do this, however, we must have some spiritual skill, and the spirit of the meeting must also be able to keep pace. Otherwise, as a rule, after singing <em>Hymns,</em> #127, we will not be able to find another hymn as a continuation because the singing has already reached the peak. For this reason we might need to reserve <em>Hymns,</em> #127 for later and sing <em>Hymns,</em> #183 first. However, if we are experienced in spirit and realize that even though <em>Hymns,</em> #127 is high, it cannot fully express our inner feeling; then perhaps we can continue with <em>Hymns,</em> #141. In such an uplifted spirit we can break the bread to remember the Lord, singing, &ldquo;Jesus, Thy head, once crown&rsquo;d with thorns, / Is crown&rsquo;d with glory now; / Heaven&rsquo;s royal diadem adorns / The mighty Victor&rsquo;s brow&rdquo; (stanza 1). If we all remember the Lord in this way, the brothers and sisters will receive an unimaginable supply.</p>
<p>I hope that the responsible brothers in the various localities will bring this matter to the Lord and learn to put it into practice. Otherwise, although we may give people food in our meetings, we may cause them to have indigestion. Meetings are for the edification of the saints, but if we do not know how to meet in a proper way, we will not only fail to edify the saints but also ruin their spiritual appetite. If we begin a meeting with <em>Hymns,</em> #183, continue with <em>Hymns,</em> #127, follow with an uplifted blessing, and then go on to <em>Hymns,</em> #141, the saints will surely feel comfortable and receive nourishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVERAL MATTERS THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION</h2>
<p>We all need to be serious and familiarize ourselves with the hymns. We should even memorize some of the hymns. The leading brothers, in particular, must spend time in this matter; otherwise, their work will be meaningless. Some of the leading brothers may say that they have a blueprint in their hand, yet after a while what they are attempting to carry out may become dead and full of the flesh. If so, there is a problem. Therefore, we need to have a careful consideration concerning the blueprint. Sometimes a blueprint may not be entirely accurate, so it is best that the brothers do not design a blueprint by themselves; rather, they should do it in coordination with the saints. Even if we have a correct blueprint, however, our way and method may not be right. Sometimes we lead the saints to consecrate themselves and to begin with their spirit, but we have not led them to deal with sins. This is not appropriate. The Holy Spirit never works together with the flesh. Thus, if we work by the flesh, we are finished. We must all learn this lesson: once we touch the Lord&rsquo;s work, we must learn to reject and deal with our flesh.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
