[1]  The Light, the Tree of Life, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil
[2]  In this volume we will see specifically the types in the Bible that are of great importance with rich significance.
[3]  THE TREE OF LIFE A. Typifying Christ as the Embodiment of God,
[4]  The tree of life is a symbol, signifying that God is life and the source of life cf.
[5]  Among the types in the Old Testament concerning Christ and the church, after the light and the tree of life, there are Adam and Eve.
[6]  Christ is light and life in order that those who are enlightened by Him and who receive Him as life may become His church as His counterpart.
[7]  In the Old Testament many times God likened Himself to a husband and His people to a wife Isa 54:5; 62:5; Jer 3:14 .
[8]  This typifies that none among God s creation can match Christ as His counterpart, for none was out of Christ, and none had the same character, life, or nature as Christ to be a perfect match to Him.
[9]  Eve received her life from Adam; she was the bone of Adam s bone and the flesh of Adam s flesh.
[10]  As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart.
[11]  He typifies Christ: as the center of God s creation, in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created; as the Head of all God s creation, the One who has the preeminence in all creation; as the One who bears God s image and likeness to express what God is; as God s representative, anointed and commissioned by God to carry out God s purpose; as the Head of all men, appointed by God in the divine administration to rule over all men; and as God who became the unique male in the universe to be the universal Bridegroom to marry His redeemed people as His bride.
[12]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON THREE THE SACRIFICIAL SKINS, THE SACRIFICES,
[13]  AND THE SEED OF THE WOMAN OUTLINE Concerning Christ s redemption: The sacrificial skins the skins of the sacrifices with which Adam and Eve were clothed: The condition of Adam and Eve before the fall.
[14]  That God made Christ the righteousness of the sinners who believe in Him that they may be justified and live before God.
[15]  From the types in the previous lesson we see that the significance of God s focusing on man in His creation of the universe and all things is that He desired to prepare for Christ a counterpart, that is, the church.
[16]  Therefore, in the revelation of the Bible, following the type of Adam and Eve for Christ and the church, there are the initial types of Christ s redemption and salvation.
[17]  Made of the Skins of Sacrifices, Typifying: a. That God Caused Christ to Be Sacrificed
[18]  He, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of the unrighteous 1 Pet 3:18 by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of man s sins, to save man and bring him to God.
[19]  That the earth might remain before God signifies that the earth might minister to God that He might carry out on the earth His eternal plan, which He purposed in Christ, that is, to produce a group of people who can make God s heart feel sweet and become the church for His satisfaction, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His full expression on the new earth for eternity.
[20]  The record in the Bible concerning the fall of Adam and Eve shows us not only the initial types of Christ s redemption but also the types of Christ s salvation.
[21]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON FOUR THE ARK AND THE GOOD LAND OUTLINE The ark typifying Christ as the salvation of God s elect: The redeeming aspect of Christ s salvation.
[22]  Milk and honey are produced out of the mingling of two lives, the vegetable life and the animal life.
[23]  The saving aspect is to save God s elect from God s punishment that they may not suffer the plagues that the world will suffer; it is also to save them from the crooked and perverted generation and to usher them into a renewed age, into a new realm of resurrection, that they may live a new life, the church life, before God and for God.
[24]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON FIVE MELCHISEDEC OUTLINE Melchisedec s status typifying what Christ is: Being without father, without mother, without genealogy, and having neither beginning of days nor end of life.
[25]  The order of arrangement in the revelation of the truths in the Bible is always marvelous.
[26]  In the biblical types, after the ark and the good land, which typify the salvation of Christ and His riches, there is Melchisedec, who typifies Christ as God s High Priest.
[27]  This is a type of Christ as God s High Priest comforting and blessing those who are His elect and who enjoy the riches of Christ and fight for God.
[28]  These are signified by Abraham s wife and his concubine.
[29]  HAGAR SYMBOLIZING THE COVENANT OF LAW A. Bringing Forth Children unto Slavery
[30]  of the Flesh by the Cutting Off of the Cross
[31]  The covenant of promise was confirmed by God with the covenant of circumcision.
[32]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON SEVEN THE RAM PROVIDED BY GOD OUTLINE A ram a male sheep : A male signifying Christ as the strong One.
[33]  A sheep signifying Christ as the meek, gentle, and perfect One.
[34]  When Abraham acted according to God s command and offered Isaac on the altar as a burnt offering, he saw a ram which God had provided as a burnt offering for his son Isaac, and he went and took it as a substitute for his son Gen 22:1-13 .
[35]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON EIGHT ISAAC AND REBEKAH OUTLINE Isaac typifying Christ: Inheriting all that the Father has.
[36]  Obtaining the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is.
[37]  Following that, we have another type, a type portraying Christ and the church, symbolized by the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah.
[38]  The old servant gave Rebekah not only a gold ring but also two gold bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels Gen 24:22, 47 .
[39]  Moreover, when the old servant went to Rebekah s house, he brought forth articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment and gave them to Rebekah v. 53 . The bracelets on her hands weighing ten shekels signify that we have received the gifts of life and thus can fulfill the requirements of God s commandments and fully fulfill the heavenly function.
[40]  At the time of our salvation, we not only receive the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge, but we also receive the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit for us to carry out the heavenly function and enjoy the riches of Christ.
[41]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON NINE THE LADDER SET UP ON THE EARTH

[44]  Bethel as God s house on the earth typifying the church as God s dwelling place on the earth: Produced by the pouring of oil on the stone, signifying that the church is formed by the pouring of the Holy Spirit on the believers as stones.
[45]  After Isaac and Rebekah as a type of Christ and the church, we have the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven in Jacob s dream and Bethel as the house of God on the earth as types portraying Christ and the church in another aspect.
[46]  A. Set Up on the Earth and Reaching to Heaven,
[47]  Christ as the heavenly ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven signifies that He brings the earth into communication and union with heaven.
[48]  Christ has been set up on the earth and has reached into heaven for the purpose of bringing God to us and bringing us to God.
[49]  A. Produced by the Pouring of Oil on the Stone,
[50]  And he vowed a vow to God, saying, This stone, which I have set as a pillar, will be God s house v. 22 . First, he made the stone his pillow.

[52]  Hated, rejected, and put to death by His brothers in the flesh.
[53]  Joseph was a type of Christ as the Beloved of God the Father, yet he was hated, rejected, and put to death by his brothers in the flesh Gen 37:4-5, 8, 18-28 .
[54]  the Bread of Life to Save Them from Death
[55]  Regarding Joseph s being the sustainer of life to distribute food, the record of the Bible is marvelous.

[57]  The couching lion signifying Christ in His skillfulness resting in the enjoyment of the fruit of His victory.
[58]  WITH JOSEPH OUTLINE Chosen and called by God the Father: Chosen seen in Jacob.
[59]  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph as the last four main persons in Genesis constitute a complete type portraying the different stages and aspects of the experiences of a complete person chosen, called, redeemed, and transformed by the Triune God.
[60]  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are a complete unit in the experience of life.
[61]  We should not consider them as separate individuals, but as different aspects of one complete spiritually mature person s complete experience of God.
[62]  Isaac, who was born of grace and redeemed by God, became the unique heir of Abraham s possessions Gen 21:9-12; Gal 4:30 .
[63]  Like Isaac, we are born not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit, as heirs of God Rom 8:17 , having the full right to participate in God s promised blessing Gal 4:28-30 , that is, to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit Gal 3:14 with all the riches of Christ.
[64]  Eventually, under God s leading and shepherding for his whole life, Jacob, who had been a supplanter, became Israel meaning the prince of God Gen 32:28 , a matured prince of God.
[65]  As Jacob was dying, he leaned on the top of his staff and worshipped the God whom he had experienced in a full way in a life of sojourning.
[66]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON THIRTEEN MOSES OUTLINE Moses typifying Christ as the Apostle: Sent by God.
[67]  In Deuteronomy 18:15 Moses said, Jehovah your God will raise up for you a Prophet from your midst, from among your brothers, like me; you shall listen to Him.
[68]  Here it indicates that Moses being a prophet was not of his own doing or of his own making; he was raised up by God.

[73]  In Exodus, first there are the types that show us the statuses of Christ as God s Apostle and Prophet Exo 3:10; 4:12 .
[74]  Then, there are different types to show us that Christ is God s full salvation and its rich supply.
[75]  C. The Red Sea Delivering the Children of Israel
[76]  C. That the Children of Israel Might Be Able
[77]  to Enter the Good Land to Enjoy Its Riches,
[78]  When God led the children of Israel out of Egypt, He severed their relationship with the world and enabled them to go on the journey to sacrifice to God.
[79]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON FIFTEEN THE PILLAR OF CLOUD AND
[80]  THE PILLAR OF FIRE OUTLINE The pillar of cloud: Typifying the Spirit.
[81]  God led the children of Israel in their crossing of the Red Sea and journeying in the wilderness with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as the guidance Exo 13:21-22 .
[82]  Both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are types with rich spiritual significance.
[83]  AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE BEING THE GLORY AS
[84]  The pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire not only protected the children of Israel but also fought the battle and gained the victory for them.
[85]  After the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, the Egyptians also went in after them into the midst of the sea.
[86]  We have God s pillar of fire and of cloud, the glory as the manifestation of God s presence, to guide and protect us and to fight for us to deliver us from the hand of our enemy that we may enjoy His full and complete salvation.
[87]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON SIXTEEN THE TREE THAT MADE
[88]  After they had crossed this separating line, they entered into the wilderness and traveled in it to follow the journey of God that they might sacrifice to God at the place where He appointed Exo 3:18 .
[89]  The first thing that the children of Israel needed in their journey through the wilderness was the thirst-quenching water and the cooling shade.
[90]  In Exodus 16:14 we see that manna was round.
[91]  The roundness of manna signifies that Christ is eternal, without beginning or ending.
[92]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON SEVENTEEN MOSES INTERCEDING
[93]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON EIGHTEEN THE TABERNACLE OUTLINE The law of God: Being a portrait of what God is.
[94]  Exposing the true condition of man so that man would be afraid to draw near to God.
[95]  On this mountain God first decreed the law, which was instituted according to what He is, as His testimony.
[96]  God, who originally was above the heavens, hidden and untouchable John 1:18a; 1 Tim 6:16a , became flesh through Christ and was embodied in Him as the tabernacle.
[97]  Through this tabernacle man can contact God and enter into God to receive Him and enjoy Him as grace and reality in fullness John 1:14c .
[98]  The table of the bread of the Presence signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply, the lampstand signifies our experience of Christ as the shining light, and the incense altar signifies our experience of Christ as the sweet incense to God for our acceptance by God.
[99]  The hidden manna in the golden pot signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply in the deepest way; the budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry; the two tables of the covenant, which are the tables of the Ten Commandments, signify our experience of Christ as the enlightening inner law, which regulates us according to God s divine nature.
[100]  The tabernacle had two veils, one being the outer veil, the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle, and the other being the inner veil, the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies Exo 26:31-37 .
[101]  Both of these veils are related to our entering into the tabernacle, God s dwelling place, and they both typify Christ.
[102]  This screen typifies Christ as the fine, pure, heavenly, royal, divine, and glorious One who suffered God s righteous judgment for our sins and became the entrance to God s Holy Place that we, the redeemed sinners, might enter into it to enjoy Christ s life supply and enlightening and to be accepted by God.
[103]  When Christ s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent from the top to the bottom Matt 27:51 , thus opening a new and living way Heb 10:20a for us who were alienated from God, who is signified by the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 , to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God.
[104]  This indicates that Christ s divine nature gold unites the believers.
[105]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON NINETEEN THE FURNITURE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE TABERNACLE OUTLINE The furniture outside the tabernacle: The bronze laver: Typifying the Holy Spirit given based on the judgment at the cross: Bronze signifying God s judgment.
[106]  The laver being made of bronze mirrors, signifying the Holy Spirit as the judging Spirit having the reflecting power.
[107]  The priests in their ministry first having to be washed in the laver, signifying the believers in their service to God first having to wash away their uncleanness in the Holy Spirit.
[108]  The tabernacle was not an empty shell that merely served as God s dwelling place; it had accessory furnishings on the outside and also furnishings as its contents on the inside.
[109]  This altar refers to the cross of Christ, on which He offered all that He was as a sacrifice to God 10:12 .
[110]  The furnishings outside the tabernacle are for assisting those who enter into the tabernacle to serve and draw near to God; the furnishings inside the tabernacle are the contents of the tabernacle, ministering to people the riches of Christ in different aspects.
[111]  Therefore, the table of the bread of the Presence signifies the riches of Christ s life as the bread of life John 6:48 for the supply of God s people that they may live and serve in God s dwelling place.
[112]  Acacia wood signifies Christ s humanity as the basic element for Him to be our feast; being overlaid with gold signifies Christ s divinity as the expression of God.
[113]  As we enjoy Christ s humanity as the supply with which to serve God, the outcome will be Christ s divinity as the expression of God.
[114]  All the above three items were in the Holy Place.
[115]  It signifies Christ in His redemption as the place where God meets with man and speaks to man.
[116]  THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT LESSON TWENTY THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL AND
[117]  Furthermore, Christ in His flesh went through the process of death and resurrection to constitute the holy anointing oil and the holy incense with His divine and human elements, the element of His human living on earth, and the element of His death and resurrection that we might belong to God and be acceptable to God.
[118]  The holy anointing oil typifies the compound Spirit, consummated by the Triune God passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, that is, the pneumatic Christ, who is God incarnated and who went through human living, died, and resurrected to anoint the persons and things that belong to God.
[119]  Exodus 30:29-30 says: Thus you shall sanctify them that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy.
[120]  Exodus 30:36 says: And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be to you most holy.
[121]  The grinding of the incense and putting it before the testimony in the tent of meeting signifies that Christ s sweet death and His fragrant resurrection are blended and offered to God as a base for the intercession of Christ and His members.
[122]  The holy anointing oil and the holy incense reveal a divine two-way traffic: through the holy anointing oil Christ coming to us from God and with God for us to enjoy, and with the incense Christ going to God with us for God s satisfaction.
[123]  Flowing myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ, fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death, calamus signifies the resurrection of Christ, cassia signifies the power and effectiveness of Christ s resurrection, and olive oil signifies the Spirit of God.
