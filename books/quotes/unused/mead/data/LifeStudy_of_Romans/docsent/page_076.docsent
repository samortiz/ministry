   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE TWENTY HEIRS OF GLORY 3 II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HEIRS CONFORMED FOR GLORIFICATION A. Many Brothers of the Firstborn</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past two messages we considered the blessings of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall see that the heirs are conformed for glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To what are the heirs conformed?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To the image of Christ, God s firstborn Son Heb 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is God s firstborn Son, and the believers are the many sons of God Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As God s firstborn Son, Christ is the model, example, pattern, and prototype for all His brothers, the many sons of God, who will be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This conformation is for the coming glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not expect to be glorified without firstly growing in life and being conformed to the image of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we expect to be glorified without being conformed, we will be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The glorification to come depends on our conformation to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, glorification depends upon our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once again I use the illustration of a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seed is sown into the ground and sprouts: this is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the carnation grows: this is the growth in life, the stage of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually the carnation plant grows to the point of blossoming: this is transfiguration and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The stage of the blossoming of the carnation plant is the stage of its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If while the carnation plant is in the sprout stage it expects without growing to blossom and to be glorified, the time of blossoming will never come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not grow in life, yet await the time of blossoming, the time of glorification, you are a dreamer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, this is exactly the situation among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Recently, I had dinner with some Christian friends who are very familiar with the outward world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They told us that a great many Christians are interested in two main aspects of prophecy: the rapture and the signs relating to the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, if we expect to be raptured without growing in life, we are dreamers, for rapture is actually our transfiguration and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No carnation seed can grow from a sprout to a blossom overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Imagine that a carnation sprout dreamed that overnight it grew from the sprout stage to the blossom stage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This may occur in a dream, but not in real life, for such an unusual development is absolutely against the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the law of life, a carnation plant must grow gradually until it reaches maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then and only then will a blossom appear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, we must grow gradually until we arrive at a full grown man Eph 4:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>. Once we reach the stage of blossoming, we are ready to be transfigured and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, glorification with transfiguration is possible only after we have reached maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may also use the illustration of graduating from college.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose a college freshman dreams that he completes his education in one night and that he will graduate the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is merely a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In reality, he should not expect to graduate until he has completed four years of study.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After he has finished all of his courses and passed all of his examinations, he will be approved for graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Graduation never comes suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians live in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although many Christians have expected to be taken to the air, eventually they all passed into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the last century and a half there have been many peculiar predictions regarding the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many so-called teachers of prophecy even dared to fix the date when the Lord would descend to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the years passed and nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every prediction failed to materialize.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was saved as a teen-ager a few years after the end of World War I. I loved to read the Bible and to know its truths.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, although I was a student with little money, I tried to buy spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many of those who taught and wrote about prophecy offered a number of predictions, most of which were shattered by the start of World War II; none were fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. M. Panton, a great teacher of the Bible, published a paper entitled Dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the mid-1930 s he printed an article which included two photographs, one of Caesar Nero and the other of Mussolini.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>D. M. Panton said, Look at these pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>See how much they resemble one another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mussolini must be the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After we came to know about this article, I said in one of the church meetings, Dear saints, Mr. Panton has published an article telling us that Mussolini is the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this is the case, certainly the Lord is coming soon, and we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers, deep in my spirit I do know one principle that the rapture is the issue of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Testament the rapture is likened to a harvest, and a harvest is possible only after the crop has matured and ripened.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the crop is not ripe, but is still tender and green, how can the harvest come?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers and sisters, look at the situation among the Lord s people today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Look at the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is it ripe?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do you believe that according to the present stage of the growth of the crop the harvest is imminent?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Look at the field nowhere is there any real growth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although there are thousands of genuine Christians everywhere on the earth as a result of two centuries of evangelization, of missionaries going out to the uttermost parts of the earth with the gospel, there is still very little growth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Where is the real growth in life?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is hardly any growth and no maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How then can we expect to have the harvest?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I dare to say that the harvest will not come until the crop is ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I spoke this word nearly forty years ago; however, the rapture has not yet happened.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Mussolini was killed and buried, and no Christian has seen the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not approach prophecy in the peculiar way of prediction.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many writers have done this and every one of them has been put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must realize that glorification with transfiguration depends upon our growing in life until we reach maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we want to be glorified, we must grow, for glorification comes as the issue of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we enter into maturity, that maturity will issue in glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Glorification will not come as an accident, as an overnight occurrence; it is the result of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brothers and sisters, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As God s crop we need to ripen until the time of harvest, the time of our transfiguration and glorification.</S>
