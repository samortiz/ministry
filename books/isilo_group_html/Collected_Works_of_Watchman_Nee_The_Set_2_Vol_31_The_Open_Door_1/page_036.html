Six of Brother Lo's students are willing to walk in this way with us and seem to be very zealous! May they have not only a good beginning but also a good continuation. I ask the Lord that they be deeply rooted in Him. When they set out, the school gave them money to flee with; they do not need to worry about clothing or food yet. We are doing our best to arrange a place for them, but we have not found anything yet. I want to return to Yuan-Jiang before the Chinese New Year, but I have not decided yet. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />January 13<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Brother Chen Hsi-wen</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>When I started out on my journey, it was not for the purpose of escaping the war. If it were, I would have escaped to Peking or Tientsin. In Tientsin I had the opportunity to study for awhile (French and spiritual books) while learning to preach the gospel. But I felt that I could not stay in Tientsin for too long. When I left Tientsin, I wandered aimlessly, not knowing where I was going. I went to the co-workers' conference with the original intention of receiving more spiritual truth and of dealing with my life's work before God. I wanted to see what God really wanted me to do before I decided where to go. For the past four years, I have had a question that cannot be answered. Should I serve the Lord while continuing in my occupation, or should I come out to serve the Lord full-time? Although I heard the call, I did not dare to acknowledge and answer it. This last summer I became completely clear; I should leave my job to serve the Lord full-time. However, it seems that there are two roads that I can follow in serving the Lord full-time (which I realized long ago). One is helping with the publications, while the other is preaching the gospel. I am not clear what the Lord wants me to do. Before I left Tientsin, one or two brothers and sisters asked me about the aspect of my work. I answered that if I did not help with the publications, I would go to the distant regions and learn to preach the gospel there. (It seems that I have a burden to do both, but practically, it seems that I must choose one because it is difficult to care for both at the same time.) It seems that, according to the Lord's present arrangement, I should take care of the publication work. Brother Nee once asked me where I planned to go. I only told him that I would temporarily go to Ch'ang-sha and then consider. I dared not tell him about going into the distant regions. Later, Brother Nee suggested that I join Brother Weigh in Yunnan. This was just according to the inward leading I had received, so I agreed. My parents have sent several letters to me and have provided the money for traveling because they want me to come home. (If I return to Fukien province, I must go to Nan-ch'ang where there is a bus that passes through northern Fukien to southern Fukien.) My inward feeling is that it is not God's will for me to return home right now. If I return home, I will be surrounded and incarcerated by my family's love. It will be difficult to leave if I want to. Returning home would give me a little of my own enjoyment, but I would not be able to serve the Lord. Therefore, I cannot go home this way. I am almost certain now that I should move away from home. Please pray for me often. In my travels with the other brothers and sisters, I learned many lessons and discovered many of my own shortcomings through quiet conversations. Once we have seen ourselves, we will never dare to raise our head to look at God or man again. But thank God, He always has a way of deliverance. May the Lord save me from my natural life of the old creation so that I would desire and pursue Him more and no longer do things loosely according to my own will, thus bringing shame to myself and failing to glorify God.</p><p>Brother Nee has already finished polishing The Normal Christian Church Life and has prepared a clean copy of the first seven chapters. There are still three chapters which Brother Nee will work on in Hong Kong. May the Lord bless this book. Whenever I read the Bible, I only see a few matters related to the spiritual life. But if it is something related to the objective truth (like prophecies, the truth of the church, etc.), I am afraid to get into it because I am afraid of wrong interpretation. This time while I was listening to the messages and preparing the manuscripts, I finally became clear about the differences between terms like teachers, prophets, shepherds, elders, and apostles. This was also the first time I had heard anything concerning the truth of the church. (Before I had only seen something concerning the meeting life, but even that was not clear.) I thank the Lord for it. When I get to Ch'ang-sha, I will report to you of the Lord's leading. May the Lord's love be with you, and may the Lord lead you in your way ahead, amen. Please greet Brother Chang, Sister Chang, and Sister Wang.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen<br />December 29, 1937</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
