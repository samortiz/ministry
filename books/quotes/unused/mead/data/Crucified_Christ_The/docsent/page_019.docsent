   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHRISTIAN'S POWER BEING IN CHRIST WHO LIVES IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you have never had such an experience, I am afraid that you are not yet saved because you do not have God and His life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian, a person who is truly saved, has Christ in him as his other person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must clearly see the fact that Christ is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason why a Christian is able to endure sufferings is because Christ lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason why a Christian can sacrifice and consecrate himself is because Christ lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason why a Christian earnestly preaches the gospel is because Christ lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The power, motivation, and burden of a Christian all come from the Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today even though many people are saved, they regrettably do not know that Christ is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people have an incomplete understanding concerning this fact and are not living in this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is similar to a person who prefers to remain in darkness and not turn on the light even though an electric lamp has been installed in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is already in us, yet to this day we still do not live by Him much of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, we still live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we have Christ, we are not willing to live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, every day all the saved ones have to face these two persons one is themselves, and the other is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Which one of the two will you choose?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you want to live in yourself or in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you live for Christ or for yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you give room to Christ or to yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the choice every Christian must personally face.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because you are a person who is subjective that is, you have a mind, emotion, and will you must make the choice by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you choose to live by Christ, this will please God, and this is what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if you choose to live by yourself, God will not be able to do anything, and He will let you do what you want.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHOOSING TO LIVE BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The key is whether you choose to live by yourself or by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you choose to live by yourself, you will appear the same as you were before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason why many Christians appear the same as the unbelievers is that they are living by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they would live by Christ, the glory and the beauty of God would be expressed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether we live by Christ or by ourselves is altogether dependent on us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God will not choose for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He desires that we choose Christ, and He has put His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, God will never choose for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not live by Him, we will still live in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose there is an electric lamp in this house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are not willing to turn on the switch, the electric company will not be able to do anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now Christ is in us, and God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not we choose to live by Christ is altogether dependent upon us.</S>
