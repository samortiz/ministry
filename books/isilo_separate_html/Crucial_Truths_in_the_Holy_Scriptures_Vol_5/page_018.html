<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Unless one is born anew...he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:3, 5); compare with <strong>&ldquo;Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:3).</p>
<p>In John 3:3 and 5 the Lord showed that entering into the kingdom of God is based on regeneration. Regeneration means to obtain the life of God in addition to one&rsquo;s natural life. Thus, entering the kingdom of God is a matter of life. Our entrance into the kingdom of God depends on whether we are regenerated. If we have the life of God, we can enter the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:3, however, the Lord said that we must turn and become like little children in order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. This is different from what He said in John 3. There He said that anyone who is regenerated can enter the kingdom of God. Here He said that only those who turn and become like little children can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Being regenerated is to obtain the life of God. Turning to become like a little child is to have a living that is humble like that of a little child. Therefore, entering into the kingdom of God is a matter related to <em>life,</em> and entering into the kingdom of the heavens is a matter related to <em>living.</em> The kingdom of God is the whole realm of God&rsquo;s reign, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is a part of that realm. The kingdom of God is general, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is specific. Those who enter the kingdom of the heavens spontaneously also enter the kingdom of God; however, those who enter the kingdom of God do not necessarily enter the kingdom of the heavens. To enter the kingdom of God, one must be regenerated and have the life of God; to enter the kingdom of the heavens, one must turn and become like a little child with a humble and overcoming living. Thus, these two portions of the Bible prove that entering the kingdom of God is different from entering the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

to Obtain Eternal Life in the Coming Age</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is no one who has left...for My sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time,...and in the coming age, eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 10:29-30; see also Matt. 19:29; Luke 18:29-30).</p>
<p>Here the Lord tells us that what a person leaves for His sake, for His gospel&rsquo;s sake, for His name&rsquo;s sake, and for His kingdom&rsquo;s sake, he will receive a hundred times as much at this time, and in the coming age, eternal life. It is easy to understand what a hundred times as much at this time means, but it is harder to understand what eternal life in the coming age means.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, we can obtain eternal life in three different time periods: in this age, in the coming age, and in eternity. To obtain eternal life in this age is to obtain the eternal life of God today, which we also will enjoy in the new heaven and new earth in eternity. To obtain eternal life in the coming age, however, means to enter into the realm of eternal life in the millennial kingdom and to reign together with the Lord. Thus, to obtain eternal life in the coming age is equal to entering the kingdom of the heavens. This is different from obtaining eternal life in this age. Obtaining eternal life in this age means that <em>eternal life enters into us</em> to be our life; obtaining eternal life in the coming age means that <em>we enter into eternal life as a realm</em> and enjoy the blessings therein. To obtain eternal life in this age, we only need to believe. To obtain eternal life in the coming age, we must give up things in this age for the sake of the Lord, His gospel, His name, and His kingdom (see also &ldquo;Obtaining Eternal Life in the Coming Age&rdquo; in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures,</em> vol. 1, pp. 144-149.)</p>

the Salvation of the Soul</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel&rsquo;s shall save it&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 8:35, see also vv. 36-38; Matt. 16:25-27; 10:37-39; Luke 21:19; John 12:25).</p>
<p>The word translated &ldquo;soul-life&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul&rdquo; in these verses is <em>psuche</em> in the original Greek. Saving the soul, finding the soul, possessing the soul, and keeping the soul all refer to the salvation of the soul. According to Mark 8:35-38 and Matthew 16:25-27, whether our soul has been saved will be determined at the Lord&rsquo;s return. If our soul has been saved, we will enjoy the glory of the kingdom of the heavens together with Him. Thus, the salvation of the soul is related to our entrance into the kingdom of the heavens to reign together with the Lord and to obtain eternal life in the coming age. This is different from the salvation of our spirit. The salvation of our spirit occurs when our spirit is enlivened through our believing in the Lord. The salvation of the soul is related to our soul&rsquo;s future entrance into the glory of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom to receive special privilege and enjoyment because we were willing to deny ourselves and lose our soul-life today.</p>
<p>The soul is the part of man that is most sensitive to enjoyment and desires. Human enjoyment and entertainment are especially related to the soul. When we suffer persecution, give up the entertainment of the world, lose the love of our relatives, and give up many desires and amusements for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, our soul suffers greatly. Losing our soul-life means to lose the things that our soul loves and enjoys. If we are willing to lose our soul-life for the Lord in this age, that is, if we hate our soul and cause it to suffer pain and loss, our soul will be saved in the coming age of the millennial kingdom. Losing our soul in this age preserves our soul in the coming age so that our soul will be able to enter into the realm of eternal life to know its glory and enter into its enjoyment and joy. If we are not willing to allow our soul to suffer pain and loss in this age for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, our soul will be saved in this age for its enjoyment of today&rsquo;s entertainment and desires. However, in the coming millennial kingdom, we will lose our souls, that is, the enjoyment of our soul because of extreme suffering at that time. We will suffer because we will not be able to enter the kingdom of eternal life to reign with the Lord in glory and enjoy His joy; instead, we will be shamed in the outer darkness and weep and gnash our teeth (see also &ldquo;The Salvation of Our Soul&rdquo; in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures,</em> vol. 1, pp. 185-188.)</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
