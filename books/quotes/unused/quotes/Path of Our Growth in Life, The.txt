If someone desires to look into the Christian life, he must realize that the Christian life is basically a matter of life
All other matters, such as reading the Bible, preaching the gospel, and serving, are also wrapped up with life
Since life is such a crucial matter, our most urgent need is to learn how to touch the way of life so that we may grow in life
Even though all the saved ones have received the Lord's life, those who do not love the Lord will not live in His life
John chapters fifteen and sixteen speak about abiding on the one hand, and about loving the Lord on the other hand
That person's nature will become your nature because you love him, and your nature will become his nature because that person loves you
We will be able to pray, read the Bible, and meet with the saints, but we will have no way to live in the Lord's life
Everyone who lives in the Lord's life not only needs to love the Lord but also should learn to deny himself in an absolute way
One group was composed of brothers, including Peter, John, and James; the other group was composed of sisters, such as Mary and Martha
In the Gospels it is difficult to find any examples that clearly show us that any of the brothers loved the Lord
Those who love the Lord are also divided into two categories-Mary represents one category, and Martha represents the other
Both Mary and Martha loved the Lord, but there was a big difference between Mary's love toward the Lord and Martha's love toward the Lord
After Lazarus died, the Lord wanted to go to Lazarus, but the disciples did not agree, saying that the Jews might stone Him
The Lord said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live
Many times within us we do not have much spiritual sensation because we have too many opinions and not very much love
Later, when they came to Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax came to Peter and said, 'Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax'?
After this, when Peter came into the house and before he opened his mouth, the Lord asked him, 'What do you think, Simon?
The Lord had told him to cast a hook, but he must have wondered where he could find a fish in such a boundless sea?
Many times as Christians we are easily influenced by things that are good or by things that are right, yet this should not be the case
If we are those who are influenced by outward things, it will be absolutely impossible for us to live in the Lord's life
As long as we love Him, give our heart to Him, and present ourselves to Him, we will be full of feeling within
If someone can come to the church in our locality twenty times without seeing us express our opinion, then we are almost matured
Today in serving the Lord, on the positive side, we do not love the Lord enough, but on the negative side, we have too much opinion
We should love the Lord, follow the Lord, lay down our opinions absolutely, and live according to the sense of life
Even the feeling that we get as a result of others' speaking stems eighty percent from religion and teaching, not from revelation or life
We do not need an eye doctor's explanation, because we spontaneously close our eyelids when someone tries to hit our eyes
Although sometimes the word that operates in us may also come from the sense of life, this is usually not the case
The word entering into his heart and working in his being may be the result of his decision, not of the Spirit
Is it because we are afraid that we would not know what to do if the Lord were to come back while we were watching a movie?
When we love the Lord, draw near to Him, and put aside our opinions, the Lord will have the ground to operate and move freely within us
At this time, regardless of what kind of opinion or thought we may have, we will be willing to lay it down and closely follow the Lord
In the story of David and Saul, Saul wanted to kill David, but when David was given the opportunity to kill Saul, he did not kill him
When he blessed Joseph while he was dying, he genuinely and boldly said that God was the One who had shepherded him all his life
We may not see the result right away, but when we look back after some years, we will be able to tell that we have made some progress
When life directs us from within and we follow the leading of life, gradually there will be a strengthening of our will
Once our spirit is strengthened, our soul will be normal, and we will be delivered from all abnormal situations
Some people naturally do not have a smart mind but because they love the Lord and are strengthened in spirit they become clear in their mind
Some people were weak in their will, but because of their love for the Lord, their spirit became strong and their will was also strengthened
On the one hand, the word of God is for our teaching; on the other hand, the word of God is really a book of revelation
In brief, this teaching is something of religion and of the mind, but revelation is something of life and of an inner consciousness
Perhaps some brothers and sisters have been reading the Bible in a solid way, but others may not have read the Bible through even once
We will speak concerning reading the Bible according to various principles, not from a superficial angle but from a very high perspective
Even those who have been saved for years may not have a thorough understanding concerning the Bible as the word of God
If we do not have such an understanding of the Bible within us, then we will not be deeply impressed by the Bible
When we read it, we sense that it is not just the words of our loved one, but it is as if we are meeting our loved one in person
Every time we read the Bible we should have the sense that we are coming not only to the word of God but to God Himself
If we do this, we will be able to read the Bible in a proper way, and the truth we read in the Bible will shine in our inner being
If we link these three verses together, they will read: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
From these verses we see that the Word of God is God Himself, God expressed, because when the hidden God became flesh, He came as the Word
If in our daily life we met one of our friends, but he would not open his mouth to speak to us, this would be troubling
If a couple had a good talk one night, and the next morning the wife suddenly became silent, this also would be very troubling
It is not adequate to say that the Lord's words are of spirit and of life, because actually the Lord's words are spirit and are life
When we read the Bible, we must realize that to know the Bible is to know the Word of God and that the Word of God is God Himself
In the end he discovered that according to his inner sense there was a world of difference between these two books
In a normal condition, when God's children come to the Word of God, they should have the feeling that they have touched God Himself
Since we should have the attitude that we are eating when we read the Bible, one might ask, 'How can we 'eat' the Bible'?
We have to see that the word of God is God Himself and that when God's words come forth, they are spirit and life
We have to read the Bible, contact the word of God, and eat the word of God with our spirit, not merely with our mind
Some people say that to read with our spirit is to read with our inner man, but what does it mean to read with our inner man?
We may come across many things that we do not understand, but it does not matter if our mind does not understand
Many times when a person reads the Word, he may not remember very much, but his spirit is still refreshed by the washing of the Word
In one kind of forgetting you read the Bible without exercising your spirit, and afterward you forget what you read
Every day we should simply exercise our spirit to read the Bible before God and bathe in the shining of His face
Regardless of how much you understand or comprehend, the most important thing is that you touch God in His word
Of course, the things that we learned in our youth are not easy to forget, but when we grow older, we become more forgetful
Even though we may not be able to memorize the entire Bible verse by verse, it is still good to memorize the general idea of each chapter
When we read the Bible, we should use our mind to memorize, understand, and look for the facts; we should not merely read the empty letters
Chapters thirteen through fifteen cover the living of consecration, and chapter sixteen covers the arrangement of some small matters
If we can grasp these points concerning having the proper attitude in reading the Bible, we will be able to read the Bible well
We need to have the right feeling and the right attitude, and then we need to find out the facts contained in the Bible
Regarding prophecies and types that are hard to understand, we should not force ourselves to try to expound them
As for all the types in the Old Testament, we have to understand them by the explanation of the New Testament and not by our intellect
If we are, we will be able to realize that the virgins denote Christians, and the oil signifies the Holy Spirit
We must interpret prophecies literally, interpret types with the words of the New Testament, and interpret parables with the entire Bible
The preaching of the gospel is a simple commission that the Lord gave us before His resurrection and ascension
If someone wants to preach the gospel powerfully and effectively, he must first get rid of sins in a noticeable way
Eventually, all their classmates or colleagues not only disapprove of, but even are disgusted with, their talkativeness
When we preach the gospel, we have to thoroughly deal with all the things that other people condemn or disapprove of
Many brothers and sisters cannot preach the gospel before men because they have many offenses with which they have not dealt
If we have never had a thorough dealing before our family, we should not expect that the gospel will be powerful with them
Today even though some people have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they still do not have the power of Pentecost
If we have not left all things to follow the Lord, even though the Holy Spirit may come upon us, no power will be manifested
To preach the gospel effectively, we need to be delivered not only from our sins and the world but also from the self
If we want to rise up to preach the gospel, we have to forsake our social position, our prestige, and our self
Suppose there is a brother among us who is a high school teacher and who has the burden to preach the gospel to people in the countryside
We cannot say that all of the Western missionaries who came to China in the early days were good, but the majority of them were very good
It is said that there were some missionaries who went to the villages to preach the gospel when they first came to Shantung
When they had to stay the night, they shared blankets with these countrymen because the poor people did not have extra blankets
Outside of their houses they raised hogs, inside their houses they raised donkeys, and in the middle of their houses they had a millstone
A gospel preacher should not have any self-consciousness, especially if he is one who preaches from the podium
Everyone who preaches the gospel, whether he is preaching from the podium or he is preaching in private, has to lose his self-consciousness
Some brothers really have a heart for the gospel, but still they cannot be delivered from their self-consciousness
If we hope that our gospel preaching would be powerful, we must carefully deal with these four matters, and the more dealings, the better
If we have been delivered from these four things, even without the definite outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we will still have some power
Without the above four deliverances, the power that comes through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit cannot be manifested
If we want to receive the power of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we have to study the situation on the day of Pentecost
Those who received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost had been delivered from certain things
If we want to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and have powerful gospel preaching, we first need to be delivered from many things
The reason why we do not have power in the gospel is that we do not have an adequate concern for people's souls
The best thing to do is to prepare a small notebook and write down all these verses and memorize them, so that we may apply them at any time
These verses include 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Isaiah 53:6; John 1:29; Hebrews 9:22; and Matthew 26:28
The sixth category is about salvation, which includes forgiveness of sins, justification, having eternal life, and having peace
The verses for this category are Acts 10:43; Isaiah 1:18; 1 John 1:9; Romans 3:28; John 6:47; 5:24; and 1 John 5:12
Some use too much of their emotion causing the whole meeting to have an emotional atmosphere yet there is no solid seed planted into people
If a person receives only a kind of excitement yet inwardly does not gain anything substantial, he will remain empty
Sometimes even though the message itself is excellent, if the seed cannot enter into the ground, it will avail nothing
Answer: It is always difficult for the rich to forget that they are rich and for the poor to forget that they are poor
For the sake of the gospel, all people should come together, having no consciousness of whether they are rich or poor, highborn or lowborn
When we preach the gospel, we have to be delivered from ourselves so that we do not know what it is to be poor or to be lowly
The other way is to hit your opponent in a way that gives the impression that you just barely put your fist on his body
Sometimes we have to preach the gospel to certain people in a mild way so that we do not give rise to any negative feelings toward us
Answer The reasons that preaching the gospel to the local Taiwanese is not as easy as preaching the gospel to the Mainlanders are as follows
Due to their change of environment, however, the Mainlanders have lost their idols, and even their idols have proved to be of no effect
With the fellowship and help from the brothers who are from the Mainland, the Lord's testimony will be propagated in Taiwan in a strong way
Question: We say that when we preach the gospel, we have to completely forget ourselves and not care for our feelings
Those who preach the gospel from the podium must have the ability to speak something that can draw people's attention and capture them
He said, 'You see, here is a man whose feet have grown into his heart, and whose heart has gone into his feet'
When we preach the gospel, first we have to stir up people's interest, and then we have to sow the seed of life into them
Some words spoken on the platform are for touching people's emotion, and some are for enlightening people's mind
If the words merely touch man's emotion or enlighten his mind, they still will not work because they are not the words of life
It is hard for a person who speaks from the podium to supply everyone's spirit from the beginning of his speaking to the end
It takes a farmer much effort to till the ground, but it takes him comparatively little effort to sow the seed
When a person's emotion is touched, we sow the words of the gospel into him, not words of emotion or knowledge, but words of life
After we have prayed adequately, we can pray in a stronger way, saying, 'O God, we ask You to stretch out Your hand to do something in him'
Although this purpose was not plainly written but hidden in a mystery, it is obvious that God's intention and purpose is Christ
If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily
Even though inwardly we may have a deep realization, outwardly we do not have the proper utterance to express this
The human elements in Christ were all problems, not only concealing the glory of God but also hindering the life of God from being expressed
Christ's death dealt with the flesh and the humanity that He had put on and also released God's life-the glorious life-from within Him
Everything of man was dealt with and everything of God was released-this is the death and resurrection of Christ
Such a humanity which is subject to troubles and problems was put on Christ as the God who is glorious and holy
When the Lord Jesus was walking on the earth within He had Gods nature with Gods glory and Gods life and without He had mans body of sin
Inwardly He was God with the holy and glorious life of God outwardly He was a man with the body of sinHe had put on the man of humiliation
We can liken this situation to placing a treasure, such as ointment, into a base vessel and then being unable to get it out
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the treasure that was within Him was God Himself and the outward base vessel was man's body of sin
Christ has come into us and has joined us to Himself so that His death, which dealt with all of our human elements, becomes our death
The whole New Testament tells us that the self the old man and the old I of a person who belongs to the Lord have been crucified with Christ
We might say Yes we belong to the Lord and we have been crucified with the Lord Jesus yet we may not have any feeling at all about this
If we really have seen this vision inwardly, our meetings will have a different atmosphere and our living will be different
Those who are from Canton will have been terminated, and those who are from Shantung also will have been terminated
Because Christians do not see who Christ is and what the cross is, today's Christianity has become a degraded religion
Through Christ's death everything of man has been dealt with; through Christ's resurrection everything of God has been released
As a result, all thoughts, persons, and teachings will lose ground in us because in Christ we have died and been dealt with
Some sisters are bothered by their talkativeness and have made up their mind again and again not to speak excessively
If through baptism we died and have been buried and raised with Christ, does this mean that we are really dead?
Suppose that we all are clear about Christs death and resurrection and a brother comes to us and says The church ought to be such and such
Whatever has not passed through the dealing and death of the cross is something of man, of the natural being, and of the old creation
Objectively speaking, Christ is one with His death and resurrection, yet subjectively speaking, how do we experience Christ?
Christ's death dealt with our human element, and Christ's resurrection released God's element to the fullest extent
The more we pay attention to Christ's death and resurrection, the more we will touch the spiritual things and be before God
Jesus said to him Blessed are you Simon Barjona because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but My Father who is in the heavens
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men
Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
The things recorded in this portion of the Word do not fit in with our human concepts, but they are part of the divine revelation
Only when a person sees and knows Christ will all of his living, doing, and behavior be out of God's revelation
A clever brother who had a clear mind and who was rich in thought once said that he did not know what God's revelation was
We should not marvel at hearing such a word because man often cannot understand or comprehend the revelation of God
Suppose also that on our way to the meeting hall we met a person who described to us the interior setting of the meeting hall
The doors and windows of the meeting hall are shut, the interior setting is concealed and blocked, and we have no way to see inside
Not until the door is opened, we enter the meeting hall, and the lights are turned on will we really understand
Once the door is opened and the real situation is revealed before our eyes, we will be able to see the meeting hall in a clear way
One is the result of hearing someone speak about Christ and about the kind of relationship we should have with Him
We may understand the doctrines concerning Christ, but we may not be able to see or know the Christ who is in us
Such a knowledge of Christ will affect us inwardly so that our living and daily walk will be directed by the Lord
He gets to know Christ in such a way that Christ directs him from within, causing him to be restrained and under control
Some people testify that the Holy Spirit in them gives them comfort, and others say that the Holy Spirit in them gives them knowledge
Eventually, however, because this person did not realize that he had a diamond, he threw it away and kept only the box
Whether it is reading the Word or receiving the leading of the Holy Spirit, God's only purpose is that we may gain Christ
Because we have too many of our own views, opinions, and ideas we often cannot see any revelation when reading the Bible
The biggest hindrances to our receiving revelation when reading the Bible are our views, opinions, and concepts
One is Matthew 16, which speaks of the cross of Christ, and the other is John 11, which is concerning the power of Christ's resurrection
The strange thing is that when we are indifferent toward the Lord, we simply put the Bible aside and do not read it
After we are revived and become zealous, we begin to read the Bible, and in so doing we read everything that is in our mind into the Bible
If the Lord were to have told us that He was going to be crucified, we also would have had our own opinion, view, and idea
Many Bible readers cannot see the revelation in the Bible because they are full of their own opinions, views, and ideas
On that day the Lord Jesus' word was very clear, but Peter still did not understand it; he was inwardly resisting it
He said to the servant Please go to the garden and plant this tree upside down with its roots facing upward and its branches facing downward
Again the master feared that the servant had not listened clearly, so he said it again and asked him, 'Did you listen carefully'?
We do not simply discover the things in the Bible; rather, we put our own opinions and thoughts into the Bible
Water itself is colorless, but if we are wearing a pair of glasses with green lenses, we may insist that water is green
The fact is that it is not the water that is colored but that we looked at it through a pair of colored glasses
We can see that the Lord already had determined what He would do to Lazarus to manifest His resurrection life with its resurrection power
We can also see that when He went to carry out this matter, the Lord encountered a problem, the problem of human opinions and views
They expected that He would come in two hours, but He did not come on the first day; neither did He come on the second day
What he meant was that if the Lord was not afraid of being stoned by the Jews and was going to die, then they would go also to die with Him
When Martha saw the Lord Jesus, the very first thing she said was, 'If You had been here, my brother would not have died'
The mighty resurrected Lord was standing in front of Martha, yet she did not even know Him or understand what He was saying
After Martha had finished speaking, she went away and secretly called her sister Mary, saying, 'The Teacher is here and is calling you'
Up to this point, by the time the Lord could say one sentence, the two sisters had already spoken ten sentences
Later, the Lord, being moved with indignation, came to the tomb and charged the people, saying, 'Take away the stone'
Even at this moment, Martha was still there expressing her opinion, saying, 'By now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there'
What she meant was that since Lazarus already smelled, it would be useless to do anything, and the Lord had no need to open the tomb
On the one hand, John 11 shows us that the Lord has the resurrection power; on the other hand, the whole story is full of human opinions
What the Lord meant was that regardless of the condition of Lazarus or the fact that he smelled, Lazarus would rise again
The reason why the Lord's resurrection life and glory often cannot be expressed through us is that we have too many opinions
Colossians 2:2b-3 says, 'The mystery of God, Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden'
All these verses show us that there is something that has never come up in our mind and does not exist in our mind
The Chinese do not have it, and in fact, everyone in the entire world other than those who have been enlightened by God do not have it
The meaning of the word revelation, not to mention the phrase the revelation of Christ, is hard for us to understand
The word revelation itself indicates that this is something that has never occurred to our mind nor come up in our heart
It is really profitable for us to spend some time to see what a revelation is and to proceed further to see the revelation of Christ
We all know that before a show begins, the stage is completely covered with a veil and that people can see only this veil
Not only did the Chinese sages find it difficult to answer these questions, but even the Western philosophers have no answers for them
Although they knew that all things were created by God, they did not know God's purpose for creating all things
Even in the New Testament age there are still many people who do not know why God created the heavens, the earth, and man
Please bear in mind that God does not save us merely for us to enjoy peace; rather, He saves us for a purpose hidden in Himself
Throughout the ages there were many prophets, but He never told any of them the purpose of His works; He never told anyone
If we are not in Christ, even though we may say that we are serving God, in actuality we cannot serve God because God is not in our service
Even young brothers and sisters, not to mention those who are in their seventies or eighties, have religious concepts
Many young people believed in the Lord and were baptized, but they have less of the element of Christ in them than they do of religion
They already have a picture in their minds of what it is to serve God before they have read the Bible or listened to a message
After being saved, there is not a single person who serves God in the church without having a set of religious concepts
Every saved person has certain concepts regarding how to be a Christian and how to conduct himself in the church
We know ethics, filial piety, propriety, justice, honesty, and the sense of shame, but we do not know the mystery of God
Only when a person has received such a revelation will he truly know the Christ of revelation and the service that is of revelation
All worship and service that is apart from Christ, though seemingly worship and service to God, is of religion
From the human perspective these things may seem to be very good, but they do not have much value in God's eyes
God unveiled this mystery which had been hidden throughout the ages to the apostles and showed them that Christ is Gods mystery Gods purpose
Previously, Christ was hidden; neither Abraham nor David nor any of the prophets in the Old Testament knew Him
Although Christ was spoken of in the Old Testament, those in the Old Testament did not know that this Christ is the center of the universe
Paul said that although the Jews required signs and the Greeks sought wisdom, the apostles preached Christ crucified
God did not want the apostles to preach signs or wisdom; instead, He wanted them to preach the crucified Christ as Lord
The apostles, however, told them that service before God is not a matter of signs or wisdom but a matter of Christ
It is not a matter of whether we keep the law, practice circumcision, or observe the feasts; rather, it is a matter of Christ
The passages we have quoted from the Scriptures truly show us that the service that God desires is service that is in Christ
Anything that is outside of Christ, no matter how good or praiseworthy it is in man's eyes, is nothing and is of no value in God's eyes
If a person experiences only the 'salvation' according to religion but not salvation according to revelation, then basically he is not saved
According to revelation, some people are already saved, but according to the perspective of religion they are not yet saved
As children of God, we should know what it means to have something of religion and what it means to have something of revelation
We may ask, 'What kind of living and service is according to religion, and what kind of living and service is according to revelation'?
Formerly, our living was loose and lukewarm, but now that we are saved and revived, we feel that we should be more serious and zealous
She may not lose her temper on the first day because she is as careful as a person carrying a glass full of water
On the second day, however, she will not do as well as she did on the first day, but she still may not lose her temper
On the fourth day, however, she will probably lose her temper in a terrible way, even more terribly than she ever did before she prayed
Even though he does not pray, touch God, or touch Christ, he already has the concept that he should be kind to his wife
Even our attempts to love our wife, be zealous, preach the gospel, and distribute tracts can all be something of religion
After he is revived, if he genuinely touches Christ, it will be impossible for him not to love his wife even if we asked him not to
We have to see at least once that Christ was crucified on the cross to bear our sins and that He is truly our Savior
It was not merely the 'I' who has a bad temper who was crucified on the cross, but even the meek 'I' was also crucified
The Holy Spirit shows us that we are already crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us
If we see this, we will no longer resolve to do good or be determined to do certain things; rather, we will simply praise
Eventually we will also see that when Christ died for us on the cross to save us, we ourselves were also crucified
Concerning the matter of service, there is service according to religion, and there is also service according to revelation
We may think about worshipping God and seeking after God, and we may also think about using different ways to serve God
To practice religion is to have certain beliefs related to these two aspects and to teach according to these beliefs
We cannot help a chicken or an ox to know God because they do not have the thought, the natural ability, or even the inclination to know God
Without the bridge there is no way to cross the river, but after we have crossed the river, we have to destroy the bridge immediately
Please remember that immediately after we receive the Lord and once we possess God, we must drop our religious concepts
If God is merciful to us to show us such a difference, we will surely put aside whatever we had before, whether it be sinful or ethical
Now that we have been enlightened by God however we see that the service that God desires is not something religious but is in another realm
One is service in spirit, service that is in Christ; the other is service in the flesh, service that is outside of Christ
Previously, he served God in religion-he was circumcised, he was zealous, and he did his best to keep all the commandments of the law
Whenever religious service gains the ground in a person, it will be difficult for that person to know Christ in a deeper way
Religious concepts fill and occupy a person so that Christ has no ground in him and has no way to express Himself through him
Please do not forget that this kind of Christian is most likely one who lives merely by his religious concepts
In this garden there were two trees-one was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the other was the tree of life
After a person has been led to God by his religious concepts, he should immediately condemn and destroy that concept
What things were gains' to him should be 'counted as loss' once he knows and sees Christ as the One of peerless worth in the universe
A person may be truly saved yet still have a very superficial experience of Christ and no spiritual progress at all
We already know what is meant by service according to religion, but do we understand what service according to revelation is?
Any service that we do without touching Christ or contacting Christ is not service according to revelation; rather, it is religious service
As long as a person fulfills a first, second, and third step, and as long as he carries out a certain procedure, he is considered saved
One day God opens our eyes and shows us that Christ is not only our Savior and our life but the One who lives in us and who is our holiness
If we have this kind of patience, we will have confidence in our flesh and will boast in our own ability to endure
One day God will show us that He does not want this kind of patience because it results in giving glory to man
Why is it that when a person reads the Bible-a book on Christ-he cannot see Christ but can see only patience, humility, and meekness?
Little do they know that the Bible says that if there is any encouragement it is in Christ and if there is any consolation it is in Christ
In brief, we cannot see the revelation of Christ when we read the Bible because we have religious concepts within us
The New Testament not only plainly records the matter of the church but also clearly sets before us the pattern of the church
The Bible shows us with clear words that there is only one church, which is the Body of Christ and that Christ is the Head of the church
Now all over the world there are thousands of expressions of the church, including one in Taipei, one in New York, and one in London
History shows us that at the beginning of the church the population of Jerusalem may have been around one million
On one day three thousand were saved and on another day five thousand were saved, but they still belonged to the church in Jerusalem
How great the boundary of a certain locality is determines how great the boundary of the church in that locality is
In Lystra , a small city whose population was probably no more than twenty to thirty thousand, there was only one church
Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
He also asked Timothy to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who called on the Lord out of a pure heart
If we put these few verses together, we will see that to be pure in heart means to desire nothing other than God Himself
To be impure does not mean that a person has some inward sins; rather, it means that he is seeking after something other than God
The fact that a person says such a thing proves that his heart is not pure, because such a one has a desire and preference other than God
If she leaves her husband's home and switches to another home because she does not eat well in her husband's home, she will be an adulteress
If the responsible brothers do not greet them one day, they will not come to the meetings anymore and will even go and meet in another place
It is all right for a housemaid to work in different homes, but it is not all right for a wife to be a wife in different homes
If we are those who simply desire God, we will see that the church is universally one and that its local expression should also be one
Just as there are many who compete for high places in the political arena, so there are also some who vie for high positions in the church
After starting a new congregational church he preaches from the podium saying We are the suchandsuch chapel and we are nondenominational
If our heart is not pure, sooner or later we will initiate something that does not correspond with what the Bible says
While taking the Lord's way of the church, we should not have any personal relationships or personal affection
May we all be able to say that even if all the leading brothers among us fall and forsake the Lord, we still will take this way
We should see that when we were in Tainan, we were brothers in Tainan, but now that we have come to Hualien, we are brothers in Hualien
In addition to standing on the proper ground, we also need to allow the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority among us
Every one of us has to learn to accept the dealing of the cross because there is no place for the flesh in the church
For the Holy Spirit to have the authority in the church, there must be the proper ground and the proper condition of the church
Regardless of whether or not the practice of a particular brother is correct, his condition has nothing to do with the ground of the church
We can only say that because the responsible brothers are fleshly, the Holy Spirit does not have the authority there
The ground is local, and upon the ground of locality the church should allow the Holy Spirit to have the authority
If a church does not have any outward signboard but inwardly has the authority of the Holy Spirit, this is the best
If there is already the clear and proper ground, and we establish another meeting, this will be a denomination
Isnt it good that some sisters who previously did not practice head covering have been covering their heads since they began meeting with us
Over these past years we have learned to base eighty percent of our knowledge concerning a person upon how he views the church
Those who have learned serious lessons would never say that this is good, because they know what is good and what is not good
A person who has genuine insight and has learned some lessons before God would not consider that the situation everywhere is the same
Someone else once asked, 'If the Holy Spirit does not have the authority in the church, will God raise up another church'?
If he is as good as the Lord Jesus, he is my son, and if he is so bad that he becomes a bandit, he is still my son
The second reason is that Christianity is full of confusion-there is great confusion in their teachings concerning the church
In the early days when we first preached the truth concerning salvation through faith, we suffered much criticism
Some pastors said, 'We have been pastors for our whole life, but we are still not clear as to whether or not we are saved
In the past, they used the expression 'taking Holy Communion' instead of 'breaking bread,' but now many of them also say 'breaking bread'
The critical matter, however, is whether or not we have the proper ground and whether or not we are contending for the right thing
Because we picked up the ground of the church, many also became clear about this matter and therefore returned to the ground of the church
Since they call themselves the Baptist Church the Presbyterian Church and the Episcopalian Church how can we call their meetings the church
If today some say, 'I am of the Presbyterian Church' or 'I am of the Baptist Church,' do you think that God will approve of this?
If God does not approve of this, should we still take newly saved ones to the Baptist Church or the Presbyterian Church?
Since we cannot belong to the Presbyterian Church or to the Baptist Church, we surely have to meet together by ourselves
On the one hand, Christianity has spread the gospel, but on the other hand, Christianity has also divided the church
