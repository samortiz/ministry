<P>Question: When the leading brothers come together to pray for the church, am I understanding correctly that you do not bring up any of the problems that you see in the saints?</P><P>Answer: Even with what we say to our wives, we must exercise our wisdom in order to have a marriage life with a peaceful and sweet feeling. We must exercise our wisdom what to say and what not to say to our wives. We also have to be careful how much we say. If we are a little careless in talking to our wives, we can create trouble. I know of some cases where a careless word from the husband to the wife resulted in a problem for their entire marriage life. We need to exercise our wisdom.</P><P>If there are three elders in a certain locality, these brothers also need to exercise their wisdom in what they say to one another. If you, as one of the three elders, see some problems with the saints, do not talk to the other two brothers right away. You have to bring this matter to the Lord and pray for it. You can ask the Lord, "Lord, what I feel about this matter may be wrong. Show me the real situation." In prayer you can follow the Lord step by step. Then you will have the leading of the Lord with some amount of assurance that the Lord is with you. In this kind of spirit and with this kind of atmosphere, you can go to the other two brothers. You also may ask the Lord, "Should I go to both brothers or should I just go to one? Which one should I go to?" Maybe the Lord would tell you to go to a certain brother and not to the other one. Wait for awhile. This is wisdom, this will help the situation, and this will never create any kind of trouble.</P><P>The elders should also be careful about letting their wives know the things concerning the church. This is risky and dangerous. Some saints told me things in confidence and charged me not to tell anyone. One dear saint opened up something to me and charged me not to let anyone know. He has gone to be with the Lord, but I have kept what he told me in confidence for over thirty years. I never made this matter known to my wife. Some day all of us will give an account to the Lord, so we must not be loose in what we say or tell others. Whatever we say and do really concerns the Lord's recovery, the Lord's interest, and it is not a small thing. If we would exercise this kind of wisdom, many troubles would be and could be avoided.</P><P>We must do our best to avoid trouble and do our best to say the same thing. All of us are assured that there is no heresy among us, and I do not believe that anyone of us has a bad feeling toward another brother. We should not form parties among ourselves or join any parties. We should not have a different attitude toward some brothers. To one brother you may be nice, but to another brother you are a different person. This is not proper. We should be the same toward everyone. We are in the Lord's recovery and in the church life. To have any preference for certain saints is wrong.</P>
