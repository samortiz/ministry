[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD THROUGHOUT THE SCRIPTURES
[3]  In this series of messages, we want to cover the enjoyment of the Lord.
[4]  We may have heard many things about God, but we have to see that the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, shows us that God is our enjoyment.
[5]  THE ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[6]  CHAPTER TWO THE FULLNESS OF GOD AND THE RICHES OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:9-10; Eph 3:8; Col 1:19; John 16:15 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FULLNESS AND THE RICHES
[7]  Whatever God is, dwells in Christ, but the Bible does not tell us that God is the door, the Lamb, or the offerings.
[8]  With Christ we also have the element of incarnation because Christ is not only the complete God but also the perfect man.
[9]  CHAPTER THREE ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST THROUGH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT THE RICHES OF CHRIST IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[10]  In chapter one He is the Word of God and the very God v. 1 . He is also the tabernacle of God, the only begotten Son of God v. 14 , the Lamb of God v. 29 , the Messiah v. 41 , the King of Israel v. 49 , and the Son of Man as the ladder v. 51 . In chapter two He is the temple v. 21 . In chapter three He is the brass serpent v. 14 and the bridegroom v. 29 , and in chapter four He is the spring of living water v. 14 .
[11]  CHAPTER FOUR ENJOYING CHRIST BY DENYING THE SELF AND EXERCISING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 12:24-26 ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST BY THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT
[12]  The Gospel of John shows us that God in Christ as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment and everything to us.
[13]  Now we need to consider how the soul is mentioned in John's Gospel in relation to our enjoyment of Christ.
[14]  John 12:25 says, "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."
[15]  CHAPTER FIVE EXERCISING THE HEART TO ENJOY THE LORD Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:22; Rom 8:23 CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT FOR OUR ENJOYMENT IN OUR HEART
[16]  In this chapter we want to continue to see how Christ as the Spirit can be our enjoyment.
[17]  In particular, we want to see how the exercise of our heart is crucial for our enjoyment of Christ.
[18]  When we are fellowshipping with the Lord in our spirit, we enjoy Him in our heart.
[19]  We cannot enjoy Him until we love Him with our heart and give Him the ground to take over all the parts of our heart.
[20]  We have to exercise our spirit to receive Him, to absorb Him, and we also have to exercise our heart to love Him.
[21]  CHAPTER SIX ENJOYING CHRIST THROUGH PRAYER Scripture Reading: Rev 5:8; 8:3-4; Rom 8:26; Psa 27:4, 8
[22]  Revelation 5:8 says, "And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints."
[23]  Romans 8:26 says, "Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[24]  In order to learn how to enjoy Christ by praying, we must drop the old way of prayer.
[25]  Instead, pray to praise Him, to adore Him, to thank Him, to behold His beauty, and to inhale Him.
[26]  The real prayer is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself, working and moving within us, that we would open to Him to breathe Him out and breathe Him in see Hymns, #255 .
[27]  If we do not pray, we have Christ within us, but we do not have Him as the incense ascending to God.
[28]  Verse 17 says, "And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?"
[29]  If Abraham would have just said, "See You again, Lord," and would not have escorted the Lord for a distance, the Lord would not have had further fellowship with him.
