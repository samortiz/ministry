   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RESULTS OF COORDINATION A. Harmony</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With such a coordination, the church will surely be in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Disharmony in the church is fully caused by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the elders are in harmony, it is impossible for the brothers and sisters not to be in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elders are the source of harmony in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not at all like to go to a church in disharmony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is a most painful experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A church in disharmony is a punishment to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How sweet, peaceful, and happy a thing it is to have harmony in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Authority</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The authority of the elders rests upon their harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A brother once asked the elders, "You tell me to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if the elders are not in harmony, whose authority do you expect me to submit to?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Which head should I submit to?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an honest statement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the elders are not in harmony, there will be no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One thing is sure: where harmony is, there is authority, and where authority is, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The living water of life flows out from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The bud shoots forth from the top of the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Resurrection life is derived from authority, and the authority of the elders comes from the harmony among them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the elders are in harmony, and if they have the authority and the life, whatever they do will bear good results.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they preach the gospel, people will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they edify others, others will get the help.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they visit, people will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church will be very prolific, and there will be clusters of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I can tell the brothers and sisters that a barren church is surely a sign of the disharmony of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the elders are in harmony, there will be authority and life; there will be the begetting and nurturing power, and there will be the abundant fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the brothers have to realize that our gains and losses are small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The big question is the harmony in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord does not have a way, if hundreds of thousands of souls are not saved, if many are not perfected and are not truly built together, the blame rests on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once the elders have a good coordination, immediately a harmonious spirit will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is authority, and this is life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under such circumstances, whatever they do, there will be abundant fruit because God's presence is there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May the Lord be merciful to us, and grant us to learn this serious lesson, so that the Lord's blessing can be poured out among us.</S>
