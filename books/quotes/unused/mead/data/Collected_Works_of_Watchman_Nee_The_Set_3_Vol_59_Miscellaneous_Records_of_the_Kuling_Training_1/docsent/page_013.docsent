   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Mind Being Limited</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people like to indulge themselves in their own whimsical thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From morning until night they are lost in wild imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their mind is like a machine that is on all day long; it is always busy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They exhaust all of their mental energy on their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the spirit calls for the mind to help, there is no strength left in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit wants to flow out, but the mind cannot provide a channel for its release.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the mind has formed a strong blockage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sharper a man's mind is, the duller he can be to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A smart person needs God's mercy to control his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the spirit within has something to say, our mind should be able to convey this word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must control our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our mind spins around all day long, it will not be able to meet the spirit's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The brothers from northern Kiangsu are very smart; they are rich in thought and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, they have not acquired much reality in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people are needlessly grieving for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Bible only says that we should not grieve the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These ones do not have to think so much; they do not have to be anxious for so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the spirit wants to be released, it needs the support of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The inner man is expressed through the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The busier a man's mind is, the less his spirit can be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mind of one who is broken in the outer man can respond to the words and directions of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man's mind is always occupied with his own things, his inner man will be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The inner man cannot survive alone or move independently.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Will Being Limited</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people like to be others' counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They even like to be God's counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They like to make proposals, suggestions, and arrangements, and they like to give directions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they use up their entire will on these things, they are powerless to serve God when their will is called upon by God to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person with a pliable will before God is very decisive when it comes to making a stand for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Throughout history we can see some of the most pliable persons making some of the toughest decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who have been touched by God in their will do not like to make their own proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The will does not become stronger through repeated use.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we wear it out, it will not serve us when we have to make necessary decisions before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A strong-willed person often crumples to the floor as soon as he faces opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His will is strong in things related to the self, but he falls as soon as he faces some tests from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter was a strong-willed person before he experienced the Lord's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His toughness was undealt with; it was a toughness within himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This toughness led to his denial of the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is difficult for the Lord to teach those whose natural will is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Peter was threatened by death, he ran away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His toughness was raw.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He needed the Lord to deal with him thoroughly and to break his natural toughness into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the only way his will could be used by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many martyrs were strong in their will because they were dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their will was both pliable and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Conditions after the Breaking of the Outer Man</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What conditions do we find after the outer man is broken?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, a man who is broken is a right person; he becomes proper in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What then is a revival?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A revival is the result of men being broken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When men are broken, they are revived.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where there is breaking, there is revival.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A broken man can bring revival wherever he goes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This revival does not come through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am not by any means despising revivals that come through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people think that prayer changes the mind of an unwilling and reluctant God and forces Him to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, God is the God of all blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though He is very eager to bless us, He often does not find the right persons to bless; He does not find the proper channel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the reason He wants us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not pray to make God willing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, we pray to make ourselves right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not struggle to make God willing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, we give ourselves to His breaking so that we become right persons before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then God will have a way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the outer man is not broken, the spirit will not be released with power.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God makes His advance through a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As soon as a man is broken, the distance between his spirit and other men is shortened; he becomes approachable to others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His spirit is free to move anytime.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He does not have to go around in circles trying to say what he wants to say.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His outer shell is broken, and the separation between him and others is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Others can draw near to him easily, and he will know men easily.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He becomes very approachable and very ready to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A person can take control of his own spirit if his outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He can use his spirit anytime.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even when power is released from his spirit, he will still be in control.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to be willing to fall before God and to accept His breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we will be able to take control of our spirit, and we will bring blessing to every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whether or not a meeting will receive blessing depends on us; we can control the amount of blessing a meeting receives.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once we are dealt with by the Lord, we can control our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we push out our spirit, it will be released, and we will bring blessing to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once we can exercise our inner man at will, our spirit will not be affected by our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We will be able to control our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We will become God's minister, and we will be free to dispense blessing to a meeting or withhold blessing from it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The power to control one's spirit rests with the minister.</S>
