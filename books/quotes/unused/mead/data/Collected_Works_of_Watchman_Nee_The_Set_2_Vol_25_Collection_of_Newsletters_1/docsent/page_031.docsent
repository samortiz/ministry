   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>5 May 1934 LETTER FROM TSINAN, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To our fellow member of Christ, Brother Kuang Jung:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already received two issues of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord, He has raised up this publication so that all His children can communicate with each other and know the condition of each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through this publication we have learned that there are nineteen localities with meetings in northern Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Soochow, Ling Tzu, and other places have meetings now as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the world is full of sin and the church is still desolated, God's faithful children are at the front line of battle fighting with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This encourages us to continue forward faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Tsinan there has been a meeting in the Lord's name for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will describe how it started and its experience so that all the brothers and sisters in the Lord can give glory to God and pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the fall of 1932, a preacher named Kung Su Teh came to Tsinan to preach the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chi Lu University also invited him to the school to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We knew of him before but did not know him, so in prayer we hoped that he would come save many sinners and uplift the cross of Christ to glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who would have thought that it would be quite the opposite?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not speak on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All he preached was socialism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that time on, we knew that he was not a Christian but a modernist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, the university made an announcement that all meetings would stop.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, that included the meeting in Dr. Stearn's an American house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From that time we had eight brothers who clearly saw that our meetings were conducted in man's way and that God was not the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we were willing to freely come before God to serve Him and receive His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We met in the wilderness or in a graveyard every Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time we did not understand any truth, but our goal was to serve God, so our reading of the Bible, prayer, and hymn-singing were very free in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We went on this way for several months.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the weather became cold and windy, but we could not find a place to get out of the cold and the wind, so we kept meeting in the cold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, it was too cold, and we could no longer stand it; all we could do was consult with the school to see if we could borrow a classroom but not be governed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The school agreed to give us a classroom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this time forward, the number of people in the meeting has sometimes been very large.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also gradually learned a few hymns of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The meetings at that time saw the brothers' hearts drawn to God in a very living manner, even though it did not have the manifestation of a praise meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not long afterwards, God showed us the element and center of the meetings through a book on worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He also showed us the commandment in Luke 22:19.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we knew that the Lord had commanded us to remember His death and manifest His death through His Supper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the meetings, we should take Christ as our center.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Oh, we thank God for showing us the light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the brothers in one accord began to have the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We wanted to obey Him so that our consciences could have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we did not know what to do; we knew only that we should obey and practice the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was a most difficult time for us!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We prayed and asked God to show us what we should do to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also discussed where we should have the meeting in the school or outside the school.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We bought a cup and a plate so we would be prepared to use them whenever we had the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every brother in one accord prayed much and waited.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who could have known that before we put anything into practice, oppression would come?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We had a brother who loved the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He knew what we were going to do, but he disagreed with us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He said that if we did this, we would stumble many other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He felt that the gospel meeting in the school would be closed if we did this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we heard this, it seemed reasonable to us, and our hearts were somewhat persuaded.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in the deepest part of our being we told ourselves that this meeting was "right."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We would not stumble brothers by our obedience; we would not cause the gospel meeting to be closed because of our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We went through a long period of prayer and considering, and finally we were not moved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although we were weak outwardly because of the breaking of the emotions inwardly there was a kind of strength surrounding us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We prayed again, asking God to show us soon what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We decided not to meet on the school campus but to rent a house that was not connected with the school in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all agreed to wait until there was a suitable place.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a few days, we met again to see whether the brothers had received revelation from God in their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A few brothers said we had to wait for a servant of the Lord to come lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We waited because we obeyed each other.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way we waited for two months, but no servant of the Lord came.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our brothers were impatient with waiting and were ready to break the bread with two or three brothers who did not feel the need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By this time, our Lord saw that we really wanted this, so He made preparations for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Oh, our Lord cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His provisions are neither fast nor slow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the beginning of February 1933, if I remember correctly, the Lord's servant, Brother Liu Tien Min, came to Tsinan from Tsou County with a friend who was sick and was going to Chi Lu Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not know that there were already brothers in Tsinan who wanted to go the way of obeying the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He stayed in Dr. Stearn's house they met in the meeting in Taishan and by chance he met one of us brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They began speaking of the brother's present spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At that time, the brother introduced us to Brother Liu.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our brother spoke with Brother Liu about how to have the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When Brother Liu heard it, he was surprised and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We invited him to tell us about the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He saw that we definitely had this desire, so he spoke a little to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because it was not convenient to speak openly in that environment, we found opportunities to visit him and speak with him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At this time, God showed us that the name of the Lord Jesus is above all other names and that we should meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now we could delay no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although many brothers and sisters still were not clear, we believed that the Lord would lead them eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At the end of the Chinese year, we rented a five-room house facing north at 50 Hsu's Garden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It was very providential that at that time Sister Peace Wang came to Tsinan to work among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many sisters also became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The meeting in the Lord's name began in March.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Oh, our hearts thanked the Lord so joyfully!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>On the first Lord's Day, there were more than twenty brothers and sisters in the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We sat at this feast, and you do not know how joyful our hearts were.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We wanted desperately to empty our thanks and praise into the Lord's bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our marvelous Lord had given Himself and shed His blood for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He had given us His full salvation and had saved us to the highest position.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We could not but praise and thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our faces before this table could not express our livingness, but our deepest parts were joyful to the uttermost while we were eating the precious things given by the Lord and drinking His cup of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Since we decided to follow the Lord in this way and go the way of obedience, outward ridicule, criticisms, and misunderstandings have been busily attacking us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But we have put them in the back of our minds, and we put our hope in our victorious Lord who is before us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Time has passed very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The school let out for summer vacation and is now back in session.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Six or seven brothers who were in one accord with us have left us to go to the places appointed by the Lord for them to work.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>At that time, the Lord prepared another house for us that is a little quieter and cleaner than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>From now on the way will be narrower and more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There are many difficulties before us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have been meeting for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We praise the Lord for the past.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We will still rely on Him for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although many denominations criticize and slander us, we can only plug our ears and ignore them as if we were deaf.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Last summer we had a baptism meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Six brothers and two sisters were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>On the first day of this year, seven sisters and four brothers were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>One of the brothers was more than sixty years old; one of the sisters was only thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>They are all precious in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We confess that in the past we were disciplined by the Lord in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Satan attacked us in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Many things were our own weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Although we have not done better, the light of the truth is what we want in the end. We ask the Lord to give us more of a heart to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We are willing to follow the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We know clearly: 1 It is not the glory and profit of the world that draws us; 2 it is not the persecution behind us that forces us to do something; and 3 it is not what our flesh likes.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We only know that we should obey the Lord's command.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>For this reason, we are willing to suffer the sufferings, difficulties, persecutions, tears, slander, and mocking that we meet on this difficult and blood-stained way.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>May the Lord deliver us from evil that we may be able to obey Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We know that many difficulties in our meeting need the prayers of the brothers and sisters in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We ask that the victorious Lord would bind Satan's authority in the air, so he can be cast out of heaven soon.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>That day is coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>What the Lord has promised us and set before us will also become reality soon.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>May we go on more faithfully, and may we take the Lord's way more watchfully.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>May the Lord give you peace!</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>From,</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Ch'ien Nung Sheng and Pan Huei Sheng</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>1934</S>
