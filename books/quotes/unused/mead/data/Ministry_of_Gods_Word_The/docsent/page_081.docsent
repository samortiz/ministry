   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Light never waits for man!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should go to the Lord and beg like those who beg for bread.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should never presume that we have it already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a very serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to see the seriousness of this matter before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to see that God has His work on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The line of God s work has never stopped; it is forever going on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who have eyes will see the line of God s work; they will know what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once we stumble, we will fall behind and will not see.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once a man is prejudiced, he will not see.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If twenty years ago we were behind in what God was doing then, we can only be further behind today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should never allow ourselves to be left outside this line.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason we have to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One thing is certain: God is going on now.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is going on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should be those who follow Him year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord will keep us in a spirit of humility and meekness, we will touch something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we are proud, arrogant, and self-justifying, we will find ourselves set aside by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are willing to be a proper audience of the word, that is, if we are willing to receive the word and not give resistance to God s word, we will touch something in the ministry, and God s blessings and light will shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some, however, have already fallen by the wayside!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will humble ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 4 tells us that the church will arrive at the fullness of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems that God is raising up the standard of His own ministry today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some have touched higher things; these are not ordinary things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But some have to wait for ten or twenty more years before they know or touch these higher things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many things can only be seen after a period of time, and we are still quite a distance from them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to ask for God s mercy so that we will see something solid and real.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord grant His church the ministry, and may we learn the lessons that we should learn.</S>
