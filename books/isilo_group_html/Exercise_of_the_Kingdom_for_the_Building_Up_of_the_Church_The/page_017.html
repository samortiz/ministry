<p>With respect to the losing of the soul, the Lord did not speak about suffering. Do not think that if you lose the soul, you will suffer. If you have had some experience with this matter, you will know that apparently the losing of the soul is a suffering, but actually it is a real joy. If a sister loses her soul by forgiving her husband, that will be a joy to her and to her family. It will issue in the building up of the proper family life. The same is true in principle with the building of the church. To lose our soulish enjoyment is a joy because as a result we see the building up of the church. If you are willing to lose your soul in a practical way, others will be nourished by you and built up through you. This is not a suffering; it is a joy.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 says that the Lord endured the cross because of the joy that was set before Him. The Lord did not go to the cross with tears; rather, He went joyfully. His going to the cross was His losing of His soul. But because He foresaw the result, He did not feel sorry for Himself about losing His soul. He knew that through His death many grains would be brought forth (John 12:24).</p>
<p>The need today is that we all learn how to lose our soul. In the church life do not insist on preserving any soulish enjoyment for yourself. This does not mean, however, that those in the brothers&rsquo; houses are expected to work like slaves. The parents of some of the brothers may misunderstand this. If you have the grace, you will realize that the losing of the soul is not a form of slavery. As you are washing dishes in the brothers&rsquo; house, you will be happy and willing to lose your soulish enjoyment to satisfy others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH TRANSFIGURED<br />
THROUGH THE LOSING OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>The losing of the soul is the basic factor in our being built up together. It is not only a matter of denying the self or of bearing the cross, but of losing the soul. We need to lose all our present soulish enjoyment for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, for the sake of the church, and for the sake of all the saints. If you are willing to lose your soul for the sake of others, those with you will be enlightened, nourished, and filled. This is the way the church is built. If all the saints are willing to lose the soul, what a wonderful situation there will be among us. There will be no offenses and even no need for forgiveness. If we are like this, we shall be rewarded with a prevailing transfiguration. But if we are not willing to lose our soul, we shall not share in this transfiguration. On the contrary, for us the church life will be darkness, and, during the time of transfiguration, we shall be rewarded with suffering. Instead of being joyful, we shall be in darkness. This is a negative reward for being unwilling to lose the soul.</p>
<p>Our willingness to lose the soul for the Lord&rsquo;s sake will cause the church to be transfigured. In other words, it will bring in a revival. Every genuine revival is a coming of Christ, a present coming of Christ with His reward (not His second coming in a physical way). He rewards the faithful ones positively and the unfaithful ones negatively. I have seen this happen in the church life. When a revival, a transfiguration, came, some were enjoying and others were gnashing their teeth in darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO FEELING OF DISSENSION</h2>
<p>How I thank the Lord for showing us these three keys, the keys of self-denial, bearing the cross, and losing the soul! If we deny ourselves, we shall not have any opinions. When I was working with Brother Nee in China, I realized that he had been appointed by the Lord to take the lead. Therefore, I did whatever he said. However, this did not mean that I did not sometimes have a better way to do certain things. According to my knowledge, my way would sometimes have saved a great deal of time. Nevertheless, I did not say a word, simply because I did not want Brother Nee to feel that I was dissenting with him. Instead of taking the time necessary to make my way clear, I denied myself, forgot my way, and followed Brother Nee&rsquo;s way. Actually, this not only saved time; it also saved us from the feeling of dissension. We all are human. If we say contrary things to one another, it is difficult to avoid the feeling of dissension. This feeling is subtle, and it may give rise to friction between us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE FLEXIBLE</h2>
<p>In 1934 Brother Nee conducted a conference in Hang-chow. At this conference, I met a certain co-worker whom Brother Nee knew very well. Regarding him, Brother Nee said, &ldquo;This brother is very good. Whenever you tell him to go west, he will go east.&rdquo; However, Brother Nee did not criticize this brother. At first, I did not understand Brother Nee&rsquo;s language, although his word impressed me. Eventually, I learned that this brother was exactly like Brother Nee had said. In those days we were all learning to deny the self. If we had insisted that this brother go in a certain direction, it would have meant that we were not denying ourselves. We had to deny ourselves to fit into his situation. We knew that if we told him to go west, he would go east. Therefore, if we wanted him to go west, we would suggest that he go east. Then he would go west.</p>
<p>Because similar situations exist among us today, all the elders need to learn to be flexible. They also need to become familiar with the various dispositions of the saints. The way to learn this is by denying the self. Although a brother may always act contrary to what we say, he is still a brother. He is the will of God for us, and we must deny the self and take him up as a cross. As we endeavor to do this, we also need to lose our soulish enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOSING THE SOUL IN THE FAMILY LIFE<br />
AND IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Husbands and wives argue with each other because they find it enjoyable. The reason a husband is not willing to lose the case to his wife is that it would mean the losing of his soul. But if a brother loses his soul by losing the case to his wife, the Lord will reward him by coming in at a certain point to save his soul. That will be the time for the soul to have its enjoyment. This illustrates the fact that the family life is built up through the losing of the soul. There cannot be a proper family life without the losing of the soul. For the sake of the family, you need to lose your enjoyment. Then the Lord Jesus will reward you in a positive way when He causes a transfiguration to take place in your family.</p>
<p>The same is true in the church life. In the church, we all need to learn to lose our soul, to lose our soulish enjoyment. By losing our souls, a transfiguration will take place. Then in the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration we shall be rewarded positively, and the Lord will save our soul. If you consider your experience, you will find that this is true.</p>
<p>Without the third key, the losing of the soul, the first two keys do not work very well. We need the last key, the losing of the soul, in the church life. In every aspect of the church life we need to lose our soul. If we lose our soulish enjoyment, we shall not argue with the brothers. Therefore, the losing of the soul is the way for the church to be built up. By the exercise of the three keys, the gates of Hades are locked up and the doors of heaven are opened. When Hades is locked up and the heavens are opened, we shall have an excellent church life. This excellent church life is the kingdom today. This is the way for the church to be built up.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
