<p>The principle of God&rsquo;s blessing is also seen in the case of Naomi in the book of Ruth. Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their two sons left Canaan, the land blessed by God, and went to the country of Moab (1:1). The Moabites were descendants of Lot who were produced through an improper union (Gen. 19:30-37). They were abominable to God and accursed by Him: &ldquo;A Moabite shall not enter the congregation of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation, no descendant of theirs shall enter the congregation of Jehovah forever&rdquo; (Deut. 23:3). Elimelech, Naomi, and their two sons went astray; they left the blessed land and went to an accursed land. This brought in God&rsquo;s judgment. Naomi&rsquo;s husband and two sons died, leaving Naomi with her two daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth (Ruth 1:1-5). God&rsquo;s hand upon Naomi was indeed severe.</p>
<p>If, instead of being subdued under such a severe judging, Naomi had made excuses and complained to God, she would have closed the door to receiving grace from God. However, she was subdued, and upon hearing that God had visited His people by giving them food, she rose up to return to the land of Judah from the country of Moab with Ruth (vv. 6-7). Naomi was subdued, not hardened, by God&rsquo;s judging. All the city of Bethlehem was stirred because of them, and Naomi said, &ldquo;Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty...The All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me&rdquo; (vv. 19-21). <em>Naomi</em> means &ldquo;my pleasantness,&rdquo; but <em>Mara</em> means &ldquo;bitterness.&rdquo; This shows that she was bitter within; she condemned and convicted herself under God&rsquo;s judging hand and willingly suffered humiliation without argument or resentment.</p>
<p>Since Naomi was humbled and subdued under God&rsquo;s judging hand, God&rsquo;s blessing was brought in. Boaz married Ruth and bore a son, Obed, but the women neighbors said, &ldquo;A son has been born to Naomi&rdquo; (4:13-17). Obed was the grandfather of David, who was according to God&rsquo;s heart. The Lord Jesus came from the line of Obed. What a blessing this was that came upon Naomi after she was judged and stricken by God! Because she was humble and accepted God&rsquo;s judgment, He became the God of blessing to her. This case shows that God&rsquo;s heart is to bless, but man&rsquo;s questionable condition requires God&rsquo;s judging hand first. God&rsquo;s judging hand comes because His blessing heart wants to bring man into His blessing. Whoever is willing to judge and condemn himself under God&rsquo;s judging will meet grace and receive blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMBLY JUDGING ONESELF<br />
AND RECEIVING GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>The God of blessing blesses us according to one principle. We receive His blessing when we humbly judge ourselves according to His judgment. For instance, a worker of the Lord might labor diligently but not see results, just like when the disciples toiled through the whole night but did not catch any fish (Luke 5:1-5). A co-worker who finds himself in such a condition should realize that this is the Lord&rsquo;s judging hand. This worker either needs God&rsquo;s dealing and discipline, or he needs God&rsquo;s purging and purifying. If the co-worker is enlightened by this dealing and is subdued under God&rsquo;s hand to judge, convict, condemn, and deal with himself, God&rsquo;s blessing will surely come upon him, and the effect of his labor will be manifested. However, if the co-worker remains hard&mdash;complaining, criticizing, or rebuking others&mdash;or is self-satisfied, God&rsquo;s blessing will not come to him. He will know God only as the judging God, not as the God of blessing.</p>
<p>Such experiences apply not only to the co-workers but also to everyone who has been saved by grace. A businessman or an entrepreneur who has incurred a great loss or has suffered frequent disasters should not think such occurrences are coincidental. We must see God&rsquo;s judging hand, be subdued, and ask Him to shine. If we would accept His discipline and His shining by judging ourselves in His light, He will have a way in us, and we will come out of our bitter circumstances.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the sisters who have a family. Children are often naughty and unruly even when disciplined or admonished. It seems that the more a mother disciplines them, the worse they become. Many sisters worry to the point of tears concerning their children. This is also God&rsquo;s judging. A child&rsquo;s condition often reflects his parents&rsquo; condition before God. If the sisters are willing to be subdued in this matter, God will shine and let them know their condition. The sisters will see how unrestrained and hard they have been in not loving God, not wanting Him, and despising His salvation. If they would repent and judge themselves in this light, God would bless them so that they experience Him more, and their children would change. This is often the way that God blesses Christians.</p>
<p>A great principle for God&rsquo;s children to learn is that in order to be blessed by God, there is a need to be humble. God judges us in order to make us humble so that we may be blessed by Him. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). A humble person, that is, a person who can inherit God&rsquo;s grace, judges and convicts himself according to God&rsquo;s judgment and repents (2 Cor. 7:9-11). God is continually doing a judging and disciplining work within us. If we cooperate with His judging, we will bring in His blessing. Blessed are the humble, for God will give them grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S MANIFOLD BLESSINGS</h2>
<p>There are manifold blessings that issue from God&rsquo;s judging. First, we gain more of God when He judges us through His shining; that is, God&rsquo;s element increases in us, and we partake of His nature. Second, through God&rsquo;s judging we are forgiven by God, experience His grace, and are filled with peace. Third, God&rsquo;s grace and blessing change our environment, and we turn from our bitter circumstances to enjoy more of His care.</p>
<p>We are thankful that He is the God of blessing. Although He is also the judging God, He judges in order to bless. In order for God to be the God of blessing, He must first be the judging God so as to open a way for us to receive His blessing. May we all touch the way to receive God&rsquo;s blessing and judge ourselves in humility. Then we will experience the God of blessing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
