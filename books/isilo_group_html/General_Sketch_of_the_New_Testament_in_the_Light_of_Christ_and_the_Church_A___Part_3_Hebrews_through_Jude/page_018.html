He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&#8221; These two verses speak of the spiritual birth and the spiritual gift. Even James stressed the matter of regeneration in his writing. Truth in verse 18 is Christ Himself. God has regenerated us with this living word, His word of truth, that we may be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. Our spiritual rebirth is the start of the Christian life.<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him.&#8221; Verse 2 speaks of &#8220;various trials.&#8221; Verses 2 through 12 deal with trials, not temptations, while verses 13 to 18 deal with temptations. Trials come from God, but temptations come from the devil. We should not endure temptations; we have to overcome temptation. What we must endure are the trials. If we endure the trials, we will receive not only the birth of life and the gift of life but the crown of life. We obtain the new birth by faith in Christ, but we receive the crown of life through our love toward the Lord. By believing in the Lord we have the divine birth, but we must go on to love the Lord so that we will receive the crown of life. The crown of life is a reward to those who love Him.<h2 class=head2>Inheriting the Kingdom</h2><p>James 2:5 continues, &#8220;Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?&#8221; The crown of life has much to do with the kingdom. Both of these are the reward promised by God to those who love Him. If we love the Lord, one day we will receive the crown of life and share in the kingdom of God.<h2 class=head2>The Indwelling Spirit and Greater Grace</h2><p>James 4:5-6 says, &#8220;Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: &#8216;The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy&#8217;? But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, &#8216;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8217;&#8221; The Spirit in verse 5 is not the human spirit but the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. Even in this book the indwelling Spirit is mentioned. The grace spoken of in verse 6 is nothing less than Christ as life to us.<p>Verses 7 and 8 continue, &#8220;Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-souled!&#8221; This book also speaks of the devil and the soul. A man should have only one soul and not be double-souled.<h2 class=head2>The Church</h2><p>James 5:14 says, &#8220;Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.&#8221; Here James speaks of the church, the elders, and divine healing.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 3: Hebrews through Jude &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
