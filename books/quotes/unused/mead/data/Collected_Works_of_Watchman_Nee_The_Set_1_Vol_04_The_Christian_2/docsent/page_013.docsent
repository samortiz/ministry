   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. THE TESTIMONY OF GOD VERSE 8 Verse 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 8: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to F. W. Grant, a Bible scholar, the phrase "Yes, amen" in the previous verse can also be included in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that this phrase, "Yes, amen" was spoken by "the Lord God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of men's unbelief, He argued with men and refuted their unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has proved in the past that the Lord Jesus will be coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is also proving this now.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these days is He not indicating through politics, religion, morality, and spirituality that Christ is coming again soon?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who can deny that these are the signs?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how unbelieving men are, these are still God's midnight crying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see John putting God and Christ together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter twenty-two, verse 13, the Lord Jesus also introduced Himself in the same way as here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows us that Christ and God are distinguishable yet inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The Lord God" is the name used for God in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This book tells us how the Lord will recreate a new garden of Eden where man will never fall again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when mentioning the new garden of Eden, He is again called "the Lord God" 22:5, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here the two names are combined.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"The Lord," which means Jehovah, is the name He used when He established the covenant with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"I am Jehovah...I have also established my covenant with them" Exo 6:2, 4 ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"God" is His common name, indicating He is greater than any man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"The Lord God" is a very appropriate name, because this name combines all the names God used in past generations, showing that God is the God of all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The One who speaks here is this God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All His promises and warnings are completely true.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One thing should be remembered: a man's name changes according to place, time, and person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At home two can call each other brothers, but in political organizations they cannot call each other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, each name God uses for Himself in the Bible has its own independent meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God reveals His own name based upon the person and the times.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How regrettable that unbelievers do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consequently many doubts arise about the source of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"I am the Alpha and the Omega."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and omega is the last.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows that He is the beginning of the beginning and the end of the end. He is the One without beginning and without end, who also is the beginning of all things and the ending of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Words are for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His word is the beginning and the ending of all speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He speaks, all that must be said is said.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the beginning, all things came into being at His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since that time He has spoken again, and all things are in place according to His command.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The One who is speaking and testifying now is also this One.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the everlasting God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What He testifies is completely true.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has not only proven the past truths, but He is also proving all the later warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"The Almighty" means "the Lord of hosts" showing that He is the Lord of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"The Almighty" was the name He used to establish the covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them" Exo 6:2-3 ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see that the names of God are names that He used in different ages in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The name "Father" of the age of grace is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He who testifies is this One, the Almighty who has the ability to fulfill His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is He who is testifying for the Lord Jesus, who was crucified in weakness in the past, but will be worshipped in power in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, His testimony is true.</S>
