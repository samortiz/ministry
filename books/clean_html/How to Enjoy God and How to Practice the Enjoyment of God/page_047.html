<h2 class="head3">Supplying Ourselves and Others</h2>
<p>Some may think that we are the only ones supplied through such praying and reading, but this is not true. As we read Romans 8:1 in this way, the Spirit may give us a feeling to pray for others. We may say, &ldquo;Many brothers and sisters have not seen this grace of having no condemnation in Christ. Lord, show them as You have shown me.&rdquo; In this prayer we are petitioning, interceding for ourselves and for the other brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>After praying in this way, we may have a feeling to speak with the brothers and sisters concerning Romans 8:1. When we receive this burden, we should respond by asking the Lord if the feeling to speak with the brothers and sisters is of Him and if He wants us to speak in the meeting. The anointing may move within us, causing us to sense that it is the Lord&rsquo;s desire. If we have a hesitation, we may express our lack of boldness to the Lord in prayer. Our hesitation may cause us to be inwardly veiled and bound. We may sense that our hesitation has offended the Lord. We should immediately respond by saying, &ldquo;Lord, if it is Your will that I speak, please strengthen and motivate me.&rdquo; We will then feel light within and begin to anticipate the evening meeting. Something within jumps at the thought of reading Romans 8:1.</p>
<p>This is not merely reading and not merely praying. After this we may intercede, receive burdens, guidance, light, and utterance. All day long we may repeat this verse, saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah, there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. When I am in Christ, who can condemn me? I am in Christ, and I can never go out. Hallelujah, I am in Christ. Hallelujah, I am not in Adam.&rdquo; We want to speak this to those who ride the bus with us. At work we may say to our colleagues, &ldquo;Do you not know that I am now in Christ!&rdquo; This verse supplies, nourishes, and waters us throughout the day. It is as if we are walking on the clouds or drunk with wine.</p>
<p>In the evening meeting a brother may be moved by the Spirit to select the hymn: &ldquo;&lsquo;No condemnation!&rsquo; precious word!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #297). After the singing, another brother may offer a prayer concerning no longer being condemned. We may then stand up and ask the saints to read Romans 8:1. We may also testify concerning how the Lord has opened our eyes to see that those who are in Him are no longer condemned. As we speak, we are released and full of the presence of the Spirit. As a result, the meeting is enlivened. As soon as we sit down, a brother may ask that we again sing &ldquo;&lsquo;No condemnation!&rsquo; precious word!&rdquo; After singing, another brother may pray, &ldquo;Lord, we thank and praise You. We are in You, and we are no longer under condemnation.&rdquo; Everyone is brought into the heavenlies. They feel that they are in the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>This example shows that not only are we filled and nourished, but we have afforded a way for the Spirit to supply other brothers and sisters. Many will be deeply impressed that there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ. In the next Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, many will offer thanksgiving and praise because there is no longer any condemnation to those who are in Christ. This is the kind of reading and praying that touches God, eats God, and drinks God. Eating and drinking in this way brings God into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Enjoy God<br />
through Reading with Praying</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Reading the Bible Sequentially</h2>
<p>I believe these examples are clear. Those who are saved and love the Lord will not find it difficult to practice this. It is very simple. We can begin to practice this in the morning or before going to bed. Simply go to the Lord. There is no need to select a special portion. We should simply follow our regular reading schedule. Whether we are in Genesis, 1 Kings, Matthew, or Ephesians, every word of the Bible is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). Every word is His expression and contains the Spirit of God and life. We simply need to change our way of reading from the former approach of studying with our mind to eating and absorbing with our spirit. The Bible is God&rsquo;s expression; it is His word. It is spirit, life, and food. We need to be clear that the Bible is not a book of teachings, commandments, or doctrines for us to study. Once we have a change of concept, half the work is done.</p>
