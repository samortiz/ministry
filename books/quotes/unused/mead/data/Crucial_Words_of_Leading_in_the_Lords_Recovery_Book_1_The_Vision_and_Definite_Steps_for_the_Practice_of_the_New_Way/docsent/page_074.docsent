   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIC STRATEGY OF THE NEW SYSTEM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REMOVAL OF THE CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be clear that the changing of the system, the spreading, and the increase are not the basic issue.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A local church may have three thousand people, thirty thousand, or even three million people; however, what is the foundation upon which the churches in the Lord s recovery are based?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are they based on big meetings, which have the clergy-laity system as their foundation and factor?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Or are they based on the home meetings, in which everyone functions?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The big meetings can never be free from the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once there is a big meeting, its very foundation supports the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if the basic ingredient of the church is the home meeting, and if the element, essence, and inward reality of the church are in the homes, how can the clergy-laity system possibly exist?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The clergy-laity system is the very root of the big meetings, and the big meetings are the tree for the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The home meetings, however, remove the clergy-laity system as the root.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the best way to eradicate the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me repeat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have no intention of offending anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please do not take offense with me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I feel that our co-workers have been working for many years but have only produced big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that the co-workers do not have the intention or motive to build up a clergy-laity system, but we may not realize that our practice can be unrelated to our intentions or motivations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is related to the principle under which we operate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we operate under a certain principle, we will produce certain kinds of results.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, we may have no intention of planting garlic, but once we plant a garlic seed, what will we reap other than garlic?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that we are not planting garlic, but we are deceived; what we are planting is garlic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, when we do things a certain way, what results is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result will manifest itself spontaneously, development by development.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that your eyes will be enlightened in the same way that the Lord has enlightened my eyes by His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not have any more regard for the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not think about them any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the past the big meetings may have helped us and edified us, but we should not long for them any more.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people are saved and are even edified, built up, and helped in the Catholic Church; others experience the same thing in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we should not hold on to such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of us, including myself, were in such places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later by the Lord s mercy we all left them, but regrettably, we now find ourselves building up what we left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, we need to be delivered from our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not hold on to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord has shown us a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to build up the church in the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must all take this view and have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not an easy task for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a big problem for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should check: After practicing the small groups and the home meetings for a year and a half, what kind of meeting do we appreciate?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do we still appreciate the big meetings, the kind of meetings where one man speaks and all listen?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The meeting for the teaching of the truth is not a big meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In each class there are only about fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The conferences are also not the big meetings, because these conference meetings are called for a special purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The joint Lord s table meetings are also not the big meetings; they are initiated when there are special needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such meetings are actually quite sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The big meetings that we are talking about here are the regular church meetings where one speaks and everyone listens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these meetings the saints cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But even today we still appreciate this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>FIGHTING EVERY STEP OF THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My point is that in order to arrive at the matter we spoke of earlier, that is, in order to arrive at the goal of the home meetings and teaching of truth lessons, we should be on the alert constantly and fight every step of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While some may say, Brother Lee, we do not see any brother opposing you, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The attack of the enemy is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we are promoting the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the brothers and sisters do not oppose our promotion of the home meetings, neither do they respond enthusiastically.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the source of this lukewarmness?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Who put this in us?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is put in us by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While Nehemiah was building the wall, others apparently were not opposing him, yet they were actually pouring cold water on his work Neh 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they heard that the wall was finished, they sent men to meet with Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Outwardly, it was to help him, but actually it was to kill him 6:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to arrive at our goal, every step of the way we need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In some halls or churches, as soon as the co-workers or elders speak of the home meetings, everyone responds favorably.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some even open up their homes immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that Satan s attacks are weak and ineffective in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In some other places, however, when the brothers say, This is the Lord s up-to-date leading, nothing happens.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even after a month no one is meeting in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that the legions of Satan s army are actively at work in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What should we do when faced with such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some who have not had any experience in spiritual warfare say, We have done our best to encourage the saints, but no one is willing to open his home.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This way must not work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the deadly attack of Satan; he turns us into a weapon in his hand and uses our mouth to launch his attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Consequently, we become discouraged and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sometimes we hear reports that the home meetings are few in number and poor in attendance, and we think that everything is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is altogether the work of agents from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we are clear about these things, we will realize that for the past few months, Satan has been sending many little soldiers and messengers to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even though no leading one has ever said, We do not agree with Brother Lee s proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are absolutely against it, the enemy knows which tactics to use.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He knows that he cannot fight the battle in this way, because it would only bring failure.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Instead, he engages in a hidden war.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Sometimes he avoids a hot war, and sometimes he even avoids a cold war; he simply brings in a war of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He encourages inactivity, a sort of lethargy, making everyone feel that the small groups are difficult to carry out and that there is no need for action.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All of these thoughts are from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that we will all rise up and ignore these voices, fighting in one accord through prayer for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not interrogate them, saying, Why are you not opening up your home?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, pray for them in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In all the halls and churches, the co-workers, elders, and full-timers must come together often.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should pray and even fast before the Lord together with the more seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must counter the enemy step by step and push him back inch by inch.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>No opportunity must be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Satan knows that with the strong foundation in the Lord s recovery and the cumulative riches that we have inherited throughout the years, he can never succeed with a frontal attack.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is the reason he is adopting cold-war tactics.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He does not send a direct blast of wind or engage in direct confrontation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Rather, he blows a little draft here and there, causing some to say, Thank the Lord, our home is open, but regrettably no one comes.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This kind of remark gives others a sour impression and discourages them from opening up their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>On the surface, such remarks appear quite innocuous.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Actually, they dampen the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A car tire is usually not punctured by an iron rod but by a small nail.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once the tire is punctured, the air leaks out slowly, and soon the car comes to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Frequently this is Satan s strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He sends a small messenger to wear us out and cool us down.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>For the past one and a half years, I was not personally involved in the church s practice, but I was observing from the side.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Lord covers me for what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I feel that even the elders do not have the awareness that we have fallen victim to Satan s tactics.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have not prayed in watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After my trip here last October, I returned to the United States to take care of many matters that were facing me there.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the midst of my busy schedule I wrote a serious letter to the elders here, reminding them in a sober way to pray and fast.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>However, when I returned, I found out that in the elders meeting only the young brothers pray.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Not many older brothers pray.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This proves that there is not an atmosphere of prayer or a spirit of prayer among us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I am not discouraged by this.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If I become discouraged, I have also fallen victim to Satan s tactic.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>However, the fact that the elders do not have a watchful and prayerful spirit means that they have come under the spell of the messengers from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The practice of the new way should be a great move of God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The church is on the verge of this new practice.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When we come together, we should have much prayer; we should fight to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is not right if I am the only one speaking every time we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In every gathering, everyone should pray and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then the Lord will grant us some suitable words.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Sometimes there is even no need for any words.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is the move of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Currently, we do not sense much of the move of the Spirit, because we have not rendered Him adequate cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>He does not want to stand still; He wants to move, but He cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We have stopped Him because we have not prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Of course, I sympathize very much with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Only five or six of the elders are serving full time; the rest have jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Today in Taiwan the economy is very fast paced.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Those who are working must struggle, or they will not be able to earn a living.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I fully understand this, and I am full of sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Still, our eyes must be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We need to see that no matter how busy we are, we must set aside some time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Especially when the elders gather together, this time must be treasured and used for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We should not merely pray eight or ten minutes and then move on to discuss business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>This will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>When the elders come together, there should only be prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We should pray and pray until the Holy Spirit moves.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The discussion of business affairs is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>In fact, every such matter, no matter how crucial it is, is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>The primary need is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>If the spirit is dormant and a spirit of prayer are lacking, the Holy Spirit will remain still.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This is the most subtle contingency that the enemy has in his camp against the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>For this reason, we must all be watchful in our prayer.</S>
