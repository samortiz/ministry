<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>Matthew 26:28 shows us that although the blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins, the blood is also the "blood of the covenant." The blood is first related to the covenant. The nature of the blood is of the covenant. The function of the blood is for the forgiveness of sins. While it is true that the shedding of the blood is for the redemption and forgiveness of sins, it is the blood of the covenant that forgives sins. If the blood were not the blood of the covenant, even though it was shed, it could not bring in forgiveness. The reason that the shedding of blood forgives sins is that God had made a covenant with man in which the shedding of the blood would bring about the forgiveness of sins. This is why the shedding of blood can forgive sins. Therefore, this verse tells us the nature of the shedding of the blood. The shedding of the blood is related to the new covenant, while the effect of the shed blood is the forgiveness of sins.</P><P>God's Word reveals that grace involves three aspects: promises, facts, and covenants. We have mentioned promises and facts and will not repeat it today. Now we will consider a covenant made with an oath. This is the central message of our conference this time. We want to see what the covenant that God has made—the new covenant—is for. Some have said that there are a total of eight covenants in the Bible. I do not know if this is right. However many there may be, the new covenant is the most important of them all.</P><P>Within a covenant, there are also promises and facts. The Bible tells us clearly that God's covenant is a promise. God's promise is what He has said with His own mouth, while God's covenant is what He has made with an oath. A promise binds a person, but a covenant binds a person even more. Furthermore, a covenant cannot be annulled. Therefore, when God made a covenant with Abraham, He swore by Himself. God not only promised Abraham but swore to him. Thank and praise God that He has not only promised us but also made a covenant with us so that we can draw near to God and lay hold of Him with boldness, according to His righteousness and faithfulness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REASON A COVENANT CONTAINS<br>A PROMISE AND A FACT</H2><P>Hebrews 9:15-18 explains to us the reason that the covenant contains a promise and fact. Verse 16 says, "For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established." The word testament is the same as the word covenant in the original language. The New Testament means "the new covenant" in the original language. In the Bible there are two meanings to the word covenant: (1) a covenant, and (2) a will, or a testament. Therefore, the new covenant can be considered both a covenant as well as a testament or a will of God. Without a promise, a covenant cannot be established. Any covenant contains a promise. For example, a certificate of loan is a covenant. Within this certificate, there is a promise. An ordinary promise does not usually have a document with it. However, a promise made in a covenant is supported by a legal procedure and bound by the law. Therefore, God's covenant includes God's promise. But it is higher than His promise. There is not much difference between God's promise and His covenant for those who have been deeply taught by God's grace and who know God in an intimate way. They know that God is faithful, just as He is righteous. Therefore, whatever God has promised, He will not leave unfulfilled. They do not have to see legal evidence for all the promises before they believe in them. They consider God's promises to be God's covenants. But for those who are weak in faith, God's promise and covenant still need to be distinguished from each other. Therefore, we cannot say that all promises are covenants. But we can say that all covenants have promises.</P><P>A covenant contains not only a promise but a testament. Therefore, with a covenant there is not only a promise but also a fact. What is willed is the fact. For example, a father may will something to his son. His testament tells of the way to dispose of his possessions. The inheritance is the result of the father's labor which the son can obtain without any work of his own. As long as he is the son, he can enjoy the inheritance. Therefore, there must be facts within a testament. Within the covenant there is a testament and inheritance. Therefore, within a covenant there is a fact.</P><P>The three aspects of grace that God has given to us in the Bible are promises, facts, and covenants. A covenant is higher than a promise or a fact. But a covenant includes a promise and a fact. Without these two things, a covenant is empty. Thank God that there are many promises that are related to the new covenant. There are also many facts that are related to the new covenant. Now we want to consider the nature of a covenant, the basis of a covenant, the relationship a covenant has with us, and the security of a covenant, etc. Suppose you receive a check or a bank draft. The first thing you want to see is the amount; when you see it you are happy. But if the check is void, it is useless. Today I can tell you that this check is very reliable and trustworthy. It can be cashed. You can be sure that you can safely draw money from it.</P>
