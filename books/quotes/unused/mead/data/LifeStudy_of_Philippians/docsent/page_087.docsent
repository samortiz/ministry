   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE APOSTLE S REMEMBRANCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BELIEVERS SUPPLY IN THE PAST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 4:15 and 16 Paul refers to those times in the past when the believers in Philippi supplied him materially.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in verse 17 Paul goes on to say, Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why does Paul refer to their giving in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely this was not written by accident, for Paul would not write anything without a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever he wrote was with a purpose and according to a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The secret to understanding Paul s purpose in these verses is in the word account vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Philippian believers supply of material things to the apostle opened an account with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 17 Paul refers to the account opened in verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible we have a revelation of the heavenly banking system.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus speaks of making a deposit in our spiritual bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to His word, we need to make deposits into our account in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Matthew 6, of course, the word account is not used.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this matter also, the revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in the Epistle to the Philippians Paul deliberately uses the word account in referring to the heavenly banking system.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 4:15 Paul says, And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This verse indicates that the church in Philippi was unique in opening an account with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With this account there is the side of giving, and the other side of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we have a double entry account, an account of both giving and receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be sure, in the account opened with Paul, the Philippian believers gave a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church in Philippi had opened an account to care for the needs of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This account, reflected in verse 15, was kept in the heavenly bank.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They sent gifts to Paul, and in return they received God s repayment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul speaks of this in verse 19: And my God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the apostle s experience, he had the conviction and assurance that God was his God through his being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since he considered the Philippians material gift to him a sacrifice to God, he assuredly believed that God, who was one with him and who was his God, would richly repay the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On behalf of God, the believers sent something to God s servant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this, God would be sure to pay them back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He would not owe the believers anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heavenly account would enter both a credit and a debit for the Philippian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Which side of the ledger do you think would be bigger the debit side or the credit side, the giving side or the receiving side?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is always the receiving side which is greater.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, on behalf of God you may give ten dollars, but God may repay you a thousand dollars, that is, a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, in your account you have a balance of nine-hundred ninety dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that you are not actually the giver; God is the One who gives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Would you not like to have such an account?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No earthly bank account can compare with it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if you open such an account with the intention of enriching yourself, God s repayment may not be given to you in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, He may wait until your greediness has been dealt with before He repays you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the Philippians had opened an account with Paul and even in Thessalonica had sent both once and again to his need, there was a period of time when no transactions took place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, Paul referred to the believers giving in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He expected that the transactions would not cease, but that there would be a continual giving and receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As Paul says in verse 17, he did not seek the gift, but the fruit which increases to the believers account.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This refers to the increase on the credit side.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In these verses Paul was encouraging the believers to keep their account active, to have no gaps in the giving and receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then there would be fruit which increased to the believers account.</S>
