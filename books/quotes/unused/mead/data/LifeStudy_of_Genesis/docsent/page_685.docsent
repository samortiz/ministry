   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Joseph comforted those who had offended him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What grace he had!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the offended one could comfort the offending ones, they could enjoy a pleasant life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Remember, Joseph and his brothers represented the people in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of Joseph's excellent spirit, they could enjoy a good time together in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But suppose Joseph wanted to render evil to his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If such had been the case, the kingdom would have been an impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Like Jacob, Joseph died in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As he was dying, he charged the children of Israel not to leave his bones in Egypt, but to bring them into the promised land 50:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that he expected the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He believed that one day he would rise up to inherit the good land and participate in all the enjoyment that would be there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hallelujah for Joseph's victorious end!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the consummation of the book of Genesis we see Christ, the kingdom, and all the aspects of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How we thank the Lord for all this!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the beginning of this book, God created man in His image to express Him, and He gave man His dominion to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the experiences of so many called ones, this book concludes with a life that, in Jacob on the one hand, expressed God in His image and, in Joseph on the other hand, represented God with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How excellent and wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, what is portrayed in Genesis was still a shadow in the age of typology.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By Joseph's time the reality had not come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, in this sense, Genesis concludes with a verse showing that Joseph died and was put in a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He died expecting the age of fulfillment in which he would share in the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In brief, as a whole, the book of Genesis begins with God's creation and ends with man's death and his being put in a coffin, even in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the fall, death, the coffin, and "Egypt" are the destiny of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, fallen man needs God's redemption, which is fully revealed and typified in the next book, Exodus.</S>
