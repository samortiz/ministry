   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WORD TO THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall give an introductory word to the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although this is an introductory word, we shall cover some crucial and weighty matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE SUBJECT THE CHURCH A. The Body</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The subject of the book of Ephesians is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians covers seven aspects of the church, the first of which is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for a living person to be complete, he must have a body as his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body of Christ is the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The term fullness has been misused, misunderstood, and misapplied by today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most Christian teachers confuse fullness with riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, when Christians speak of the fullness of Christ, they think it means the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, although many Christians speak of the fullness of the Holy Spirit or the fullness of God, not many speak of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the book of Ephesians, the word fullness does not mean riches; it means expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The term the riches of Christ is found in 3:8, and the term fullness is found both in 1:23 and 4:13.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter one mentions the fullness of Him who fills all in all, and chapter four, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 4:13, the fullness has a stature, and the stature has a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we have a body, we all have a stature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we were a head without a body, we would not have a stature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fullness of Christ is the Body, for 4:13 says that this fullness has a stature with a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This fullness is different from the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The riches have no stature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the fullness as the Body has a stature, and with this stature there is a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, this strongly proves that the fullness of Christ is not the riches of Christ, but the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is important to know why the Body of Christ is called the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The body of a person is simply the fullness of that person, and this fullness is his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As I speak, I move with my body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way, my being is expressed through my body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, the church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How profound this is!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The whole universe is filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the One who fills all in all, Christ is exceedingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a great Person needs a great Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The riches of Christ may be likened to all the rich foodstuffs produced in America.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These riches are not for exhibition; they are for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we eat of the rich American foodstuffs, these riches seem to disappear into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When these riches are digested and assimilated by us, they become part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, they are no longer the riches, but the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the husky young American men, who assimilate so much of the rich American foodstuffs, are the fullness of America.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By means of this illustration we can differentiate between the riches and the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The riches are the food which has not yet been taken into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when the food is eaten, digested, and assimilated, it becomes the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The riches of Christ are all the items of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we digest and assimilate into our being the riches of Christ, these riches become part of us, and we become the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the universally great Person who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the first item or aspect of what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>B. The New Man</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Secondly, the church is the new man 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the universe there is just one new man; hence, the church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a significant difference between the Body and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Body requires only life, but the new man requires both the life and the person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My body has life, but my being as a man has a person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is not only the Body of Christ having the life of Christ; it is also the new man having Christ as the person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No doubt, this new man is corporate, for 2:15 says that Christ created two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that two collective peoples have been created into the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we see that the church today is not only the Body, but a man with a person, our realization of the church life will be uplifted.</S>
