   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Revelation 6:12-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood; and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And heaven was removed like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I dare not say that this passage has already been fulfilled in full, nor dare I say that it has not been fulfilled at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the last century, something similar to this happened in Australia; it is a historical fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some even reported at that time that there was the appearance of what is described in Revelation 6:15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This seems to indicate that this passage has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the situation in 6:14 still has not occurred in history to a full extent, so it seems that this verse has not yet come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Black sackcloth describes the tents of the Jews and the Arabs which were made of black sackcloth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The stars of heaven fell to the earth" may refer to comets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can the stars, which are bigger than the earth, fall to the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps it means the direction that the stars are falling is toward the earth and does not mean that they are actually hitting the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Revelation 6:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And the kings of the earth and their great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that their consciences sense that God's judgment has come; it is not the Bible that tells them that the time of judgment has come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the blood of the Lord can give us peace in our conscience and saves us from God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is more secure then the caves and the rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Revelation 6:17</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"For the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VISIONS INSERTED BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH SEALS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>REVELATION 7 A. The Remnants of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 7:1-8</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has three groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One group is the Jews on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One is the church, which is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 7:1 through 8 refers to the earthly Jews, among whom is one group which is protected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 7:9 through 17 describes the scene of the rapture of the church to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Strictly speaking, according to the Bible the great tribulation should last only three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The other tribulations are merely calamities or trials.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fifth trumpet is perhaps the beginning of the great tribulation, but by the sounding of the seventh trumpet, we have no doubt that the great tribulation has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 7:1</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"The four winds."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament the wind often represent God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For instance, a great wind arose when Jonah was at sea Jonah 1:4; Isa 11:15; Jer 13:24; 22:22; 49:36; 51:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 7:25 "the winds blew"; this is also a kind of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"No wind would blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree"; therefore, the earth is calm, the sea has no waves, and the trees are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does this in order to seal all the people He wants to protect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once the seventh seal is opened, the seven trumpets will be sounded.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the first trumpet is sounded, the third part of the earth and the trees will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the second trumpet is sounded, the third part of the sea will become blood Rev 8:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation 7:2</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"And I saw another Angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom authority was given to harm the earth and the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Another Angel."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is this angel?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the original, the word "Angel" is "messenger."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An angel may be called a messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man may also be called a messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This book mentions "Another angel" several times.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "another" indicates that this one is different from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Revelation 8:3, 10:1-3, and 18:1 all speak of this "another Angel."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Other than the Lord Jesus, who could have this authority?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who else could have this glory?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Mr. Panton said the word "another" has a special meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It infers another class, another appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Old Testament, the title "the angel of the Lord" has a special meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By reading carefully, we immediately realize that this must refer to the Lord Jesus Gen 16:7-14; 22:1-13; 32:24-30; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>13:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord's name here, Angel, is a title used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This title shows that the Lord is about to lay aside the church and return to His position in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Another Angel..., having the seal of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This seal must be put into the hands of the One who is the closest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus is the unique man beside God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Pharaoh put the seal into Joseph's hands Gen 41:42 ; in the same way, God put the seal into the Lord Jesus' hands.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"He cried...to the four angels to whom authority was given to harm."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From this we see that all the events that will happen to the earth originate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If God does not give the authority, the four angels can do nothing.</S>
