   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From Ephesians chapters one, two, and three, we have seen one vision after another.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These visions conclude with all the riches of God, which can be considered as the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, this is only the first half of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After these chapters, there are still chapters four, five, and six.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now, from chapter four, we will consider the divine dispensing in the divine economy from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This angle is very high, particular, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It shows us that the divine dispensing begins with the Triune God and ends with us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Ephesians 4:4-6, Paul first refers to the one Body, the one Spirit, and the one hope of our calling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then he refers to the one Lord, the one faith, and the one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Finally, he refers to the one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 4 concerns God the Spirit, verse 5 concerns God the Son, and verse 6 speaks of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, each Person is mentioned with some qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the Spirit, there are three points: one Body, one Spirit, and one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the Son, there are also three points: one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the Father, there are also three points: over all, through all, and in us all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE SPIRIT AS THE ESSENCE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus commissioned the disciples to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this verse the Father is mentioned first, then the Son, and the Spirit last.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in Ephesians 4:4-6, the order is reversed the Spirit is mentioned first, then the Son, and the Father last.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning, when we baptize people into the Triune God, the Father is first, because the Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through baptism, people are baptized into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body of Christ does not begin with the Father, but with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are baptized, we are baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now in the Body of Christ, we are experiencing the Spirit, the Son, and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In one case the order runs from top to bottom unto the result.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the other case the order runs from bottom to top unto the source.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, the church as the Body of Christ is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not in the Holy Spirit, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only when we are in the Holy Spirit can we be free from the flesh, and only then is there the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Spirit is the essence of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An essence is more intrinsic than an element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is not the element of the Body, but the essence of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not have the Spirit within us, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are the church because we have the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The totality of the Spirit in you, in me, and in all the believers is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The divine dispensing of the Spirit as the essence of the Body of Christ produces a glorious hope in all the members of the Body of Christ, and this hope is that our bodies will be redeemed, that is, glorified Rom 8:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our whole being will enter into the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At present, our bodies have not yet entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we have the hope that one day, when the Lord comes, our body of the old creation will be brought into the glory of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, the Spirit within us is constantly sealing us, nourishing us, and saturating us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He has fully saturated us, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time our hope will become a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our body will no longer be a body of flesh; it will be a spiritual body that is permeated with the Spirit.</S>
