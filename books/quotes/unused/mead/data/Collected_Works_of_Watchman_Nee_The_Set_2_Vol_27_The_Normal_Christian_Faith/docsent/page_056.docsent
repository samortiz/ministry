   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps you have heard about the doctrines of Christ for more than ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But all the time you have simply stored them up in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is merely a mental consent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Up till today, you are still a fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your consent has done you no good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must confess that you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must proclaim, "I believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that He is now in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I also believe that on the cross He has taken away my sins and that He has crucified my old man and given me a new life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With this faith, you will be brought face to face with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You will touch Him, and salvation will be accomplished in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a matter of faith and not of agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OLD SEVENTY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A few years ago, an Italian warship was anchored off Gibraltar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the evening all the sailors went on shore to gamble, drink, and cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among them was one called Old Seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was always the head of the band.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That night while he was roaming around the pier, he saw a house, inside which were a few ladies playing the piano, singing hymns, and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He had never been to a place like this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of curiosity, he went in. A woman preacher came up and began to preach to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She did not care whether he was drunk or not, but started to tell him about Christ's death for sinners, His forgiveness of sins, and His bestowing of a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end she told him that all he needed to do to be saved was believe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Old Seventy was very touched.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He prayed to the Lord Jesus, believed in Him, and accepted Him as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Afterwards, he went back to the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was about to go to bed but felt that he should pray again, so he knelt down before his bunk.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were more than twenty other sailors in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they saw what he did, they started to shout, "Hurrah, something new!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Old Seventy has a new trick!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He really acts like he's praying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That's great.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can sit up now."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Old Seventy was still praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The crowd began to throw boots at him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But he paid no attention to the boots.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After his prayer, he stood up and solemnly declared to everyone that he had believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that word everyone roared and applauded for his excellent show.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>NOT THE SAME</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The next morning, while he was scrubbing the deck, an older sailor came to him and told him that he also was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He asked Old Seventy whether he felt a distinctive joy and peace within him or not.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there was not, he was afraid that it was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Old Seventy replied, "The Americans only told me that when I believe in Christ, my sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They did not tell me anything about peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have to find this out from them."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He took leave and went on shore to ask the ladies why it was that he did not have peace and joy after conversion, and whether his faith was a hoax.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>An elderly lady sat him down and said, "Don't worry about how you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me just ask you one question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are you different from how you were before?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Old Seventy replied, "I am altogether not the same as before."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a pause, he repeated loudly, "No, I am not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was the most rowdy and mischievous among my company.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When it came to wickedness, I was always the first.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After last night, I cannot utter filthy words anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I heard the others using foul language, not only was I unable to join them, I was even ashamed of them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Last night they threw boots at me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Formerly, I would have risen up and given each one of them a good beating.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I felt as if nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I didn't even want to beat them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am definitely not the same as before!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No, I can't be!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At this word, he turned around and ran back to the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>THE EFFECT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a man has not believed in Christ, nothing will happen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But once he believes, everything in Christ will come into him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even if he does not feel different, in reality he is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some say that this is the effect of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not the effect of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is the effect of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When I was in Kaifeng, I met the chief of a department in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Formerly, he was a mere consenter of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This time, he believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He told me, "I used to think that there was not much difference between believing and agreeing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But a recent incident showed me that I am not the same person I used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have been given charge of a clubhouse with a tennis court to which high government officials regularly attend.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not infrequent for these people to leave sums of money in the club for the furnishing of tennis equipment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Recently, due to an order from the government, many officers were transferred.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They left quite a bit of money and belongings in the club.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"Since they have left and no one knows where they are, the money and belongings naturally would become my possession.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They will never come back for them, and no one will ever quibble about them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But somehow I felt that I could not claim those items.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I had to take the trouble of looking up each one of their addresses and sending the items back to them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This kind of thing would never have happened to me before.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am definitely changed."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>POWER IN FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A man who has met Christ in faith is different.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Only those who have touched Christ have His power manifested through them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All the filthy and binding sins are shaken off from us when we touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The minute we believe in Him, His resurrection life comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By faith all these become real in us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Not only are our lives changed by faith, but there is a very great power within this faith which motivates thousands to become missionaries and martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This great power within is irrepressible and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It makes man willing to suffer for the Lord, ride through danger, and eventually be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All these abilities come from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we touch Christ, everything of Him will be transmitted into us.</S>
