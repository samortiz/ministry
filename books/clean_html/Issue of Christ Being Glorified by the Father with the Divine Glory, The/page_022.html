<P>In order to see this revelation, it will be helpful for us to reconsider how the New Testament is composed. The first three books, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are called the Synoptic Gospels; although they have some element of mystery, they are not Gospels of the eternal mystery. The eternal mystery is in the last Gospel, the Gospel of John. The Synoptic Gospels can be more easily understood than John can. John begins by saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (v. 1). Then verse 14 says, "The Word became flesh." John the Baptist saw this One and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (v. 29). He also saw the Spirit as a dove descending upon and abiding upon Christ (v. 32). Then at the end of chapter one of John, we can paraphrase what the Lord said to Nathanael in this way: "You recognize Me as the Son of God, but you will see the angels ascending and descending on Me, the Son of Man" (v.51). All of these verses show that John 1 is a mystery. In order to see this mystery, we need to know how to interpret all these figures.</P><P>In chapter twelve of John this Wonderful One was exalted by His disciples, but He did not accept their kind of exaltation. That meant nothing to Him. Instead, He said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified" (v. 23). What a mystery glorification is! Then He explained that one grain of wheat, if it does not die, abides alone. But if it dies, it will be glorified (v. 24). Christ as the one grain of wheat, through His death and resurrection, became many grains, and these many grains are the issue of His being glorified.</P><P>The Gospel of John explains the issue of His glorification in chapter fourteen. This issue is the universal incorporation. First, the three of the Triune God were incorporated from eternity. In John 14:10 the Lord told Philip, "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me." This reveals that the three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated into one incorporation by Their mutual coinhering. Verse 10 of John 14 unveils to us the beginning of this universal incorporation in eternity. Verse11 shows that the three are also an incorporation by Their mutual work. They work together as one.</P><P>One day the second of the Divine Trinity was sent by this incorporation. Acts 2:23 indicates that the three parties of this universal incorporation had a council (1 Pet. 1:20). In this council it was agreed to send the second into time to become a man (Micah 5:2). Before the incarnation, this universal incorporation consisted of three parties. Then the second of the Divine Trinity brought this divine incorporation into humanity. His disciples always wondered, "Who is this man?" They talked secretly among themselves about Him, but they did not know who He was intrinsically. In John 14:20 the Lord told them that on the day of resurrection they would know that He is in the Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them. These three ins reveal that the consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>In John 14 the Lord revealed that He came as the first Comforter and that another One would come as the second Comforter. The second Comforter is the reality of the first Comforter. He is the Spirit of reality, and verse 17 says that this Spirit of reality would be in the disciples. The in of verse17 as a general statement is the totality of the three ins in verse20 as a detailed statement. When the Spirit of reality is in us, the totality of the Triune God is in us to incorporate us into the universal incorporation. In eternity it was a divine incorporation. By being enlarged, this incorporation became a divine and human incorporation. This incorporation is the house of the Father, the universal vine tree of the Son, and the new man of the Spirit.</P><P>In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you." The Spirit of reality declares all the things concerning Christ in the last twenty-two books of the New Testament, the Epistles.</P><P>I began to love the Bible from the day I was saved in 1925. I have spent the past seventy-one years studying the Bible, but it was not until recently that I saw so clearly that the goal of God's economy is the enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. The unbelievers will go into the lake of fire. They have nothing to do with this universal incorporation. But all of the believers will eventually be incorporated into this one great incorporation. The final consummation of this universal incorporation is the New Jerusalem. Mainly three apostles&#151;Paul, Peter, and John&#151;present this revelation to us in their Epistles piece by piece and bit by bit. By the Lord's mercy, we have put these pieces together to see a full and complete vision of this universal incorporation.</P><P>The three aspects of the universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers are revealed in John 14 through 16: a house, a tree, and a child. John 16 shows us the child born of the Spirit (v. 21). This child is Christ. Eventually, this child becomes the new man. In Colossians 3 we are told that Christ is this new man. He is every member and is in every member of the new man (vv.10-11). In God's eyes the house, the tree, and the man in John 14 through 16 are all Christ. Christ is the house, the temple, the dwelling place of God; Christ is the vine tree; and Christ is the new man. In the previous message we saw the Father's house. In this message we want to see the true vine and the new child, the new man.</P>
