   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all must look to the Lord with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we see Him thoroughly, we can reflect Him as a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this we will be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the transformation accomplished by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we have another compound title of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not the Father God that transforms us, but the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Spirit is not teaching or correcting us, but transforming and metabolizing us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is putting the riches of His element into us to discharge all our old, natural element and replace us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is not making us an adjusted man, but a new man!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we will be fully mingled with God, and this total mingling is God s habitation, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the basic concept of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is the total mingling of God with man for His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This should help us to realize what the proper church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not the sisters coming to the meeting with their heads covered, and the brothers meeting as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that I am disregarding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What I mean is that the real church life does not consist of these outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The real church life is to be filled up and saturated with the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why do we not say certain things?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not simply because it may be wrong, but because the Lord Spirit within us will not say them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He will not say them, then we will not say them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if it is right, we still will not say them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether we say them or not is not based upon right or wrong, but upon the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the basic concept of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people today are talking about the church life, but in a way that is based upon right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Jerusalem there will be no teachings of right or wrong, but the total mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PEARL GATES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we obtain this mingling?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To enter into the New Jerusalem, we must pass through one of the twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every gate was made of one pearl Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The producing of a pearl is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It starts in a living oyster in the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Something, such as a grain of sand, enters into the oyster and makes a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then, because the grain of sand abides at the wound, the oyster secretes a kind of life juice around the grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually a pearl is produced by the secretions of the oyster s life juice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the work of Christ, the Son of God, as the second Person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He came to be such a living One in the death waters of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are the grains of sand that wounded Him at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we stay at this wound, He will secrete His life over us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way we all become pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a picture of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regeneration is the entrance into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How did we get into the church?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was not by joining or by being sprinkled, but by realizing that in all this world full of death there is Someone living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Someone died on the cross by being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we believe in Him, we abide at this wound of the cross, and the life of Jesus begins to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From that time onward there is a secretion of life over us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the gate into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This includes redemption, crucifixion, resurrection, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE GOLDEN STREET</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once we are in the gate, we are on the street of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In typology, gold signifies the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we enter into the gate of regeneration, we are immediately on the street of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s divine nature becomes our way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose a brother wants to have his hair cut.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Should he have it cut long or short?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no verse in the Bible telling us how to cut our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But our way is the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God s divine essence is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have a golden way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need not ask anyone, but turn to the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The divine nature will become the way we cut our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will know what kind of haircut to have.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not take our way or anyone else s way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should take the golden way!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is something golden within us!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have been regenerated and have passed through the gates of pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now we are on the golden street, the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The divine nature within us has become our street.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we call on the Lord from deep within to contact this divine nature, we know the way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no need to tell you where the golden street is.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As long as we have passed through the pearly gates, we are on it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is only one way, for in the New Jerusalem there is only one street.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The American, Chinese, and German believers are all on the same golden way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This golden street is God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many Christians today say that we must do everything according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I was influenced to believe that.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But later, as I studied more of the Bible, I realized that if everything we did was according to the Scriptures, our Bible would need thousands of chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It would take us years to read through this Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But we do not need such a thick Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have the divine nature!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After being regenerated, we are on the golden way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have the divine nature within us as our living way.</S>
