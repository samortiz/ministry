   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ in Resurrection Living in Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 14:16-20 reveals that the Christ in resurrection now lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord Jesus says, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to verse 16, the Lord Jesus will ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Son was the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the first Comforter asked the Father to send another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who will be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in verse 18 the Lord goes on to say, I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When taken together with verse 17, this indicates He who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the I who is the Lord Himself in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, referring to the day of His resurrection, the Lord says in John 14:20, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the Lord clearly says I in you, revealing that He Himself will be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the Lord lives in us, He does not cease to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, in John 14:20 He says, I am in My Father; on the other hand, He says, I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord certainly is not saying, When I come into you, I shall cease to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, here the Lord seems to be saying, When I come into you, I shall come into you with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only am I in the Father, but the Father also is in Me. Therefore, when I am in you, the Father who is in Me is also in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This understanding of verse 20 is proved by the Lord s word in verse 23: If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here the Father and the Son making an abode with us is equal to the phrase I in you in verse 20.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who is in us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The I who is in us is not only the Son, but the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what about the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 14:26 the Lord Jesus speaks of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son came in the Father s name John 5:43 because the Son and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we see that the Spirit is sent in the Son s name because the Spirit and the Son also are one 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit reaching us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, when the Spirit comes, the Son and the Father also come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we put these verses together, we see that the One who is within us is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No doubt, this One is the Son, but this is the Son in whom the Father is, and also the Son who is coming with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, eventually we see that I in John 14:20 is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Seeing the Lord Because He Lives in Us</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 14:19 the Lord Jesus says, Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord had remained in the tomb, He would not have lived, and the disciples would not have seen Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this verse indicates that because He lives we shall see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said that He would rise up and live and that we also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to understand this verse, we need to study the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s word, You behold Me; because I live, you shall live also, means, I shall live in you to make you live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here the Lord Jesus is telling us that after His resurrection He would live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At this point let me ask you a question: have you seen the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some might answer this question by saying that they have seen the Lord Jesus in the saints, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One who answers the question in this way does not have the proper understanding of John 14:19.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord does not say in this verse, You behold Me because you see Me in other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, the Lord s word indicates that we see Him because He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We live because He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that we live because He lives in us to make us live.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In answer to the question concerning whether we have seen the Lord, we should say, I have seen the Lord because He lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, a brother sees his wife because she lives with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the One we now see not only lives with us He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every moment He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because He lives in us, we may see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The chorus of the well-known hymn, He lives, goes like this:</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>lives today!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He walks with me and talks with</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>me along life s narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You ask me how I know He lives?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He lives within my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a good hymn, and I appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The chorus says that we know Christ lives because He walks with us and talks with us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, this is not as good as saying that we know Christ lives because He lives within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In answer to the question, How do you know Christ lives? the chorus of this hymn answers, He lives within my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We know that the Lord lives not simply because He walks with us and talks with us, but because He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How do you know Christ lives?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should answer this question by saying, I know He lives because He lives in me Likewise, if we are asked if we have seen the Lord Jesus, we should say, Yes, I have seen the Lord, for He lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even while you are asking me this question, He lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because He lives in me, I see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even now as I am speaking, I can see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>While I am speaking to you, He is speaking to me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am simply a transmitter speaking whatever He speaks to me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord s word, Because I live, you shall live also, certainly was fully fulfilled on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When Peter stood up with the eleven, that was Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Peter s speaking was also Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If someone had asked Peter where Christ is, he might have said, Christ is here.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Don t you see me?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you see me, you see Christ because He lives in me.</S>
