   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Ability to Bear Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With the compound ointment, there is also the number five.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The four spices plus the one hin of olive oil are five ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible the number five signifies responsibility and the ability for bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Five is composed of four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may use the human hand as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On our hand we have four fingers and a thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of this our hand can do many things and bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible there are clear illustrations of the fact that five is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Ten Commandments were written on two tablets, five on each tablet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These five commandments on each tablet signify responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Also, there are the ten virgins in Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are divided into two groups: five wise ones and five foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that all the believers bear the responsibility of being filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We creatures are signified by the number four, and God is signified by the number one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God is added to us, we have the ability to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we were the number four, but we have had the unique God added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we are the number five.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being without God is like having four fingers without a thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as it is awkward not to have a thumb, it is more than awkward not to have God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have seen, there are three units of five hundred shekels of the spices.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, there is three times five hundred, and five hundred is one hundred times five.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This signifies that in this compound ointment there is the fullness of ability for bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Compound Ointment for God's Building</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Five and three are the basic numbers in the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have seen, three is the number of the Godhead, and there are three units of five hundred shekels in the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second unit of five hundred shekels is split in half, indicating that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the compound ointment, there are four spices added to one hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Five is four plus one the creature plus the Creator to be the ability to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would like us to read a few portions from the Bible to see more of the significance of the numbers five and three.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us first consider the dimensions of the ark, which Noah built, in Genesis 6.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After God created everything, He intended to build up something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first item of God's building was the ark of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ark is the seed of God's building, and the New Jerusalem is the harvest of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this seed the New Jerusalem grows out and grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The numbers three and five are prevalent in the dimensions of the ark, the first item of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 6:15 says, "And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 16 says that the ark was to be made with "lower, second, and third stories."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here with the dimensions of the ark, we have multiples of the numbers three and five.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Three, the number of the Triune God, and five, the number of responsibility, the number of God added to man, are the numbers of God's building.</S>
