   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEEKNESS AND FORBEARANCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 10:1 Paul says that he entreats through the meekness and forbearance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the apostle, being firmly attached to Christ 1:21 and one with Him, lives by Him, behaving in His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the virtues of Christ were becoming Paul s virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Meekness was a virtue in the humanity of Christ by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ s meekness is not a simple matter, for it is in His humanity and by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He was on earth, He lived a human life by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this mingling of divinity and humanity the virtue of meekness was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle is the same with Christ s virtue of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forbearance is another virtue of Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you know the difference between meekness and forbearance?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have the virtue of meekness means that you do not invade others or fight with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, you are willing to give in. The meek give in to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But those who are strong in a natural way fight and refuse to give in. At the least, they want to stand their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meek, however, give in, do not fight, and do not invade others territory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To have forbearance means that you are willing to allow others to invade you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that to have forbearance is to suffer affliction and injury.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To have meekness is not to invade others, but to give in to them; to have forbearance means that you are willing to be invaded by others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are two of the virtues Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Paul lived Christ, the virtues of Christ became his.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The phrase through the meekness and forbearance of Christ indicates that Paul was one with Christ and took Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, he entreated the believers not by himself, but entreated them through the virtues of Christ, in particular through Christ s meekness and forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul entreated others by Christ, in Christ, and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PAUL S PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After telling us the way he entreats, Paul goes on to speak of the kind of person he was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He says in verse 1, I myself, Paul,...who as to appearance am indeed lowly among you, but absent am of good courage toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This description of Paul s person fits in with the subject of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The subject of this Epistle is the kind of person Paul was and the kind of life he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul did not care that much for the work he did; he cared much more for his person and living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have pointed out, in chapter ten he does not even mention the purpose of his entreaty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was so concerned about the way he entreated that he did not mention why he entreated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regarding his person, Paul says that he was lowly when among the Corinthians, but was of good courage when absent from them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The apostle was bold, having courage to speak out in his Epistle the real situation among the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can learn from Paul to be meek when in the presence of others, but to be bold when we are absent from them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you are with a particular person, you should not be too bold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, you may be bold in writing a letter to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may say, I can be bold when I am present with a person; however, when I am absent from that one, my boldness seems to evaporate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that your boldness in that person s presence is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If your boldness does not evaporate after you have left a person s presence, then it may be a proper kind of boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul was very bold in writing to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we could be in Paul s presence, we would find him meek and lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is much for us to learn from the way Paul conducted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we want to treat a person in a bold way, we should wait until we are no longer in that person s presence and see if our boldness remains.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was Paul s way of dealing with the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He entreated them through the meekness and forbearance of Christ, and he was lowly among them, but he was bold in writing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In these verses we see Paul s meekness, forbearance, lowliness, and proper boldness.</S>
