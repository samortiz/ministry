   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENLIGHTENING AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past few evenings we have seen how God manifested His grace and accomplished His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen how God through His Son Jesus died for us and for our sins, thus accomplishing the work of redemption Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His work of redemption justifies us before God through faith in His blood Rom 3:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His resurrection from the dead becomes the assurance of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through this resurrection we know that God has accepted the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work of the Lord Jesus has satisfied God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His resurrection is a proof to us of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All who believe in the blood of His Son and who come to Him through His redemption are now justified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Tonight I will not cover the other aspect of the Lord's work, which is His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since many brothers and sisters already know about this, I will just mention it in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ascension of the Lord Jesus is His appearing before God on our behalf, that we might be accepted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is ascension?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible ascension means only one thing objectively, which is for one to be accepted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the Lord Jesus has appeared before God Heb 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also appear before God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way God accepts us in the same way that He has accepted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ENLIGHTENING TO SEEK OUT SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Tonight we must mention another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gospel is inadequate if it mentions only the work of the Father and the Son without mentioning the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be the mention of the Holy Spirit also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of the gospel is of three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Luke 15 shows us three parables.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, we see the loving Father waiting to receive the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, we see the good Shepherd coming to the world to seek for the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One sees the Father waiting at home for the repentant and saved sinner, and one also sees the Son coming to the world to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after the Lord's work was completed and before the sinner reaches home, there was another parable, which is the woman patiently and carefully seeking the lost coin with a lighted lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, one sees the Lord Jesus coming to earth to seek for the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, one sees the woman lighting the lamp to enlighten, sweep, and seek for the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Holy Spirit is working together with the Father and the Son to seek out the sinner for the accomplishing of the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son came to die for the sinner; the Father receives the sinner home; and the Holy Spirit works to enlighten man's heart and to show man his real position.</S>
