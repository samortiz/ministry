   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE INCARNATION OF GOD TO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The apostles teaching is the entire speaking of God concerning God s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem Matt 1:18-25; Rev 21:1-3, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This speaking is not concerning baptism, head covering, foot-washing, or the Lord s table; it is concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians have never heard the term God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word for economy may also be translated arrangement, administration, or plan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has a plan, and thus, He has an arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to carry out His plan under His arrangement, He needs an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every day I have a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I rise up early in the morning to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then I eat breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After breakfast I walk for about ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then I go to do my day s work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I may read or answer some correspondence, or I may listen to the reading of some messages, or write some outlines, or study some verses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At 11:30 I may have an appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After that I have lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the afternoon after a nap, I may have another appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I have dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After dinner I may have an evening meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that I have a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Incarnation of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s New Testament plan is to get Himself incarnated Luke 1:30-31, 34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How marvelous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For thousands of years God remained as the divine God, but He had a New Testament plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first step of His plan was to become incarnated, to get Himself mingled with man in order to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the procedure by which God was brought into man that He might mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God was born in a virgin Matt 1:18, 20 and spent nine months in Mary s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way He partook of man s blood and flesh Heb 2:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After His birth He passed through human living Acts 10:38; 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Human living is a part of the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God became a man in order to live on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not become a man to stay on the earth for only a few hours and then go back to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No, He stayed here for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He spent approximately thirty years in a carpenter s home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then He began to travel as a traveling preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That was His living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He suffered very much, and He knew the feeling of summer and of winter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He knew all the turmoils common to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The All-inclusive Death of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second step in God s plan is the marvelous, all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such an all-inclusive death dealt with sin 2 Cor 5:21 and with sins 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It also dealt with the old man Rom 6:6 and the flesh Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The all-inclusive death of Christ also dealt with Satan, the serpent John 3:14; Heb 2:14b , and with the world John 12:31-33, 24a , which is hanging on Satan 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This death solved all the problems between man and God and accomplished God s eternal redemption, signified by the blood flowing out of the crucified Jesus Heb 9:12; John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ also released the divine life as the eternal life, signified by the water flowing out of the crucified Christ John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The all-inclusive death of Christ is our death and is our history, because we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How marvelous is His death!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Resurrection of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After His all-inclusive death, the Lord Jesus resurrected Matt 16:21b; Acts 2:24; 3:15; 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The resurrection of Jesus Christ testifies that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God in Him and with Him Rom 4:25b .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our being justified in Him is the objective justification, and our being justified with Him is the subjective justification.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ now lives with us, and we live with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus we live a life that enables us to be justified subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In His resurrection Jesus the man was begotten as the Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The resurrection of Jesus Christ was Christ s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jesus the man was born as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The resurrection of Christ also imparted the divine life into the believers of Jesus Christ and begot them as the many sons of God 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; John 12:24b .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The resurrection of Jesus Christ also made Him the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Finally, this resurrection consummated the Triune God and made the Spirit of God the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit Matt 28:19; John 7:39; Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before His incarnation the Triune God as the divine person did not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, we may say that He was perfect but not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was short of the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Through incarnation He obtained the human nature; yet He was still short of something in that He had never entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even after He died on the cross, the Triune God was still short of something because He had not yet entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In resurrection the consummation of the Triune God was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was not until this consummation of the Triune God in resurrection that the Triune God s title the Father, the Son, and the Spirit was mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus met the disciples on a mountain in Galilee Matt 28:16 , and He told them to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Triune God has now been completed; He has now been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ s resurrection was the consummating of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Spirit of God is now released, and the Spirit of God is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The title the Spirit is simple, but the significance of this title is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>John 7:39 says, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Jesus was glorified in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After He was glorified, the Spirit was there.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the last chapter of the last book of the New Testament, the title the Spirit is used Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In such a title no reference is made to God, to Christ, to the Son, or to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Spirit is the consummated, processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This One is the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our Bridegroom is a marvelous person the Triune God, processed and ultimately consummated as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the Spirit is the Father, the Son, the human nature, the all-inclusive death, and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Spirit is the Bridegroom, and the regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man is the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>At the end of the Bible there is a wonderful couple who constitute a wonderful story of the Bridegroom with the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Still, with Christ s resurrection God s plan was not yet finished.</S>
