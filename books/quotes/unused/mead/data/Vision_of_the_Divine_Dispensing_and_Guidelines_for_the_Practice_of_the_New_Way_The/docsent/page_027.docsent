   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Most Comprehensive Way to Read</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Bible Based on the Experience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of Believers throughout the Ages</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now I would like to show you the most comprehensive way to read the Bible based on the experience of believers throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are three methods to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being Nourished Daily in the Spiritual Life</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>by Pray-reading Two or Three Verses</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sequentially through a Book of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every Morning for Ten to Fifteen Minutes</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should spend ten to fifteen minutes early every morning to do nothing else but to sequentially pray-read two or three verses from a designated portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During this time, you should not merely read but pray-read, that is, to speak to the Lord directly with the Lord's word and to pray the Lord's word into you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the best way to be nourished in your spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although everyone is busy during the day with very little extra time, everyone can get up fifteen minutes earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever is willing can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This way is suitable for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the beginning, it may require some effort, but after a while, it will become your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, this way of reading helps you to retain the Lord's word in your heart easily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the day you can "chew" on these words again and again, digesting and receiving the Lord's supply from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first method of reading, and it is the most necessary one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Studying a Book of the Bible in Depth</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>for Thirty Minutes Every Day</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way of studying the Bible by diving into a particular book should not be overlooked.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we may pray-read two or three verses of the Bible every morning and obtain spiritual nourishment and light, the degree of help we receive may differ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If your knowledge of the Bible is deep, the nourishment you obtain will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because their knowledge of the Bible is not so accurate, the supply many obtain is not very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, reading the Bible requires an accurate understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, a wrong understanding in reading the Bible is better than not reading at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But understanding the Bible correctly is certainly better than misunderstanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, an accurate understanding in reading the Bible depends on the reader's degree of knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, we have to receive the teaching, and continuously dig deeper into the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Speed-reading Three Chapters of the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and One Chapter of the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>for Fifteen Minutes Every Day</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another way to read the Bible is speed-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The best time to do this is after lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should read four chapters each time in a sequential way three in the Old Testament starting from Genesis and one in the New Testament starting from Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of reading does not require much thinking; you do not need to try to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Simply read through the chapters quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not matter if you understand or remember what you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply read on step by step every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the long run, you will surely get the help.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In spiritual things, do not try to be too fast or to do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most valuable way in spiritual matters is to do things a little at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is like little streams that flow for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It would be marvelous if we could read the Bible in this way throughout the entire year.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I treasure very much the fact that you can devote one or two years of your time to wholeheartedly be trained here while you are young.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church, many spiritual things are received from and taught by others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have learned most of your knowledge of the truths from me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is very little that you have that was not received from others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I myself was the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the first forty years of my Christian life, nearly everything I had was learned through others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later, the Lord was merciful to me and gave me some light directly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was able to see the matters of God's economy, God's dispensing, God's mingling with man, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I had this latent ability to understand these things not only because of the growth in life, but also because of the training in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is like a person who wants to advance in education.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He must reach a certain level of proficiency first before he can do research and discover new things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible is not a common book but a highly specialized book.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not something that man can understand with his natural mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do not believe that as soon as a person opens up the Bible, he can see the light within it and acquire an accurate understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, studying the Bible requires teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The simplest way for us to teach people to read the Bible is to give them a kind of leading, guidance, or adjustment in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of teaching is best carried out when you are pray-reading with others or when praying in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Spontaneously, as you are pray-reading or praying with others, some words will come out which contain the enlightening or teaching element.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When others receive the supply, they will also receive the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to have this kind of prayer in the Lord, you have to have a great deal of knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to my experience, a proper prayer is with power, and this real power comes from your accumulated labor on the Word of God through the years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose some of you have not yet graduated from college, and you come here to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You will feel that the training is strenuous because your mental capability has not received enough development.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You will also find out that there are things that you cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is one more thing that I have to make clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The word of the Bible is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not physical food, but spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The physical food does not need to pass through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It goes directly into our stomach and is digested.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, since the Bible is spiritual food, it needs to pass through our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Suppose a person does not know English, yet you give him an English Bible to read.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He will have no way to comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, in order to partake of the Lord's word, we must use our spirit and exercise and train our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Bible is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, this spiritual food is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When it comes into our being, we will not only be satisfied, but God will be dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As a result, we will grow with the growth of God Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, after you graduate from college, and before you step into society, you should set aside two years to be trained here.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This will cause you not only to be filled in life, but also to be educated in the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This will surely be a big profit to your experience of human life in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For you to be able to do this is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Unconsciously, your entire being will be affected; your thought, concept, and knowledge of people and of God will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is not only a blessing to you personally, but also to your family.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the future it will be a blessing to society, and it will also be a big help to the church.</S>
