   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 6 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:9-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapters three and four Paul speaks concerning the qualifications of the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first qualification is that of being constituted of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This qualification is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We become competent, sufficient, equipped, and qualified to be ministers of the new covenant by being thoroughly constituted of the Triune God, who is now the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As these ministers are constituted of such a One, the effectiveness of Christ s all-inclusive death operates within their being, terminating the old creation and killing the flesh and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the constitution received by the apostles, there are a number of factors or ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These ingredients are typified by the spices used to make the ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One of these factors is the effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Daily this ingredient, this factor, works within the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, in their daily living there is nothing of the old creation: no self, no flesh, no natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This killing element can be compared to an antibiotic used to kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Along with the factor that puts to death the old creation, there is another factor, a positive one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the factor of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This ingredient includes not only divinity, but also Christ s resurrected and uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The resurrected Christ Himself is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The processed God as the life-giving Spirit includes divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, it is a very significant matter to be constituted of the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has been processed, and we have been constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the resurrected Christ is also the ascended One, the exalted and enthroned One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person can be helped by medicine without understanding all the ingredients of the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, although it is helpful to know all the elements of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we can be helped by these ingredients even without understanding them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We simply need to take the dose of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then the elements of death and resurrection will work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As resurrection works within us, we become heavenly, empowered, and authorized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ingredient of resurrection often works in us apart from our consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This can be compared to the way an antibiotic works in us apart from our consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today the ingredient of resurrection is working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his living Paul had the highest humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul s humanity was actually an expression of the human living of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had been constituted of the life of Jesus and thereby became properly human, Jesusly human.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we come to the remaining chapters in this book, we shall see how outstanding is Paul s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have pointed out that the basic qualification of a new covenant minister is to be constituted of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The constitution is the base, the foundation, of the qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We today also need this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In doing anything or learning anything, we need a base.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we would be ministers of the new covenant, we must have the constitution as a basic qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second qualification of the ministers of the new covenant is to conduct themselves for the shining out of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their conduct and behavior were based on their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because they had been constituted in a certain way, they could live a life that manifests the truth and shines forth the glory of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was not necessary for them to determine to do something to cause themselves to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, apart from their consciousness and intention, simply by the way they lived, there was a shining forth from their being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their constitution became their shining.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, charcoal does not shine, but a gold coin shines.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Between the charcoal and the gold there is a difference of constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because of their constitution, the apostles shined forth the glory of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was not necessary for them to preach, for their being was shining.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because this shining came out of their being, their constitution, their behavior was not a performance of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today people often behave in a certain way to match the occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This behavior is a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, on some occasions they may conduct themselves with pride, as if they were dignitaries.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But on other occasions they may conduct themselves humbly as subordinates.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All this is a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, those who are qualified to be ministers of the new covenant do not behave in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, their behavior, based on their constitution, is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the second qualification of a new covenant minister.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I aspire to follow Paul s example.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By the Lord s mercy, I do not want to perform in any way, but I want to have a behavior which comes out of my constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Third, the apostles lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Day by day they were under the grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As Jesus of Nazareth lived a crucified life, so the apostles also lived this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus was crucified throughout His life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He lived a crucified life from the time He was born in the manger.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then through all the years He was continually being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was under the grinding, the killing, the putting to death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But this killing afforded Him the opportunity to manifest the resurrection life from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before Christ was actually nailed to the cross, He had already lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In like manner, before Christ was resurrected, the resurrection life had already been manifested in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In their ministry the apostles were, on the one hand, captives in the Lord s triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>On the other hand, they were crucified ones, those who daily lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They were put to death, crucified, not only by the opposers, but even by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By reading the book of 1 Corinthians we can see that the Corinthian believers put the apostles on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This was the reason Paul said, Daily I die 1 Cor 15:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Daily he was being put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the living of a crucified life for the manifestation of resurrection life and for the truth of everything ministered by the apostles to others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Under the grinding, the outer man of the apostles was consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But simultaneously they were renewed in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They were constituted of the Triune God, they behaved themselves according to this constitution to shine out the glory of the gospel, and they lived a crucified life for the consuming of the outward man and the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These were the qualifications for them to be ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I hope that not only the leading ones in the churches but all the saints, including the young ones, will be impressed with these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not think that you are too young to have some experience of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Yes, I did point out that it takes many years to be constituted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Nevertheless, it is also true that the Lord can use even those who are young.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I can testify that not long after I was saved, the Lord began to use me, for there was some amount of the divine constitution within me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This constitution is the base, the foundation, for us to be used by the Lord as a new covenant minister.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This constitution affects our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When I was saved, there was a change in my inner constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Spontaneously I began to behave according to this constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although I was never taught to live a crucified life, I automatically began to live this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As a result, early in my Christian life, I became a little minister of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Being a minister of the new covenant is a matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We all can be new covenant ministers, as long as we have the constitution and conduct ourselves according to it and live a crucified life with the elements of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then we all, brothers and sisters alike, can be used by the Lord as little ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>By the end of chapter four, Paul has recorded fully the qualifications of the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In 5:1 he expresses his aspiration, his desire and longing, to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Paul was mature and ready to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He was like ripened wheat in a field that is ready for harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This wheat is golden, no longer green.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Hence, it is ready to be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This understanding of the rapture is very different from the sugar-coated doctrines common today.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>D. M. Panton once pointed out that today s preachers often give people admission tickets that will not be accepted by those guarding the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Yes, you may have a certain ticket, but eventually it will be exposed as invalid and unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Christians today are being given a ticket which they think entitles them to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Eventually they may realize that they have been cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Rapture is a matter of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>What farmer would harvest grain that is still tender, young, and green?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>No farmer would do this.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Instead, he would allow such unripe grain to remain in the field and grow until it is ready for harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Paul was one mature in Christ, mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Therefore, he was truly ready to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>However, at Paul s time, not many believers were mature.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>For this reason, the harvest could not take place.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Even after nineteen hundred years, the Lord Jesus still has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The reason for the delay is that not very many have matured in life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Many believers do not have the genuine desire or longing to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The reason they lack such a desire is that they are not mature.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Little children, for example, desire only to play and have a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But as they grow older and mature, they desire to graduate from school, have a good job, and get married and raise a family.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Desire is always related to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>An infant has only very simple desires because with an infant there is no growth and certainly no maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But the more we grow and mature, the deeper and higher our desires become.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If you claim that you have the desire to be raptured, to be clothed upon with a heavenly building, then you must pass through 2 Corinthians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Only after experiencing this chapter can we have this desire.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Otherwise, we shall be like children in kindergarten who claim they have the desire to graduate from college.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In 5:1 Paul speaks of our earthly tabernacle-house, a rather particular expression.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>In the Bible tabernacle is a special term indicating God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Paul s use of this word in 5:1 indicates that our dwelling place is also the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Furthermore, this tabernacle is not only a dwelling place for both God and us; it is also a place for us to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Our physical body today is a tabernacle, a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Our physical body, in which our person dwells, is not only for our living, but also for worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is the reason Paul refers to our body as a tabernacle-house.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Paul s thought here is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>His thought is fully saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>He surely was mature and ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Therefore, his longing was to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>He did not desire to be unclothed, but he longed to be clothed upon with a transfigured body.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>When you have such a longing, such an aspiration, you are a mature believer, one who is ready to be reaped, ready for the harvest.</S>
