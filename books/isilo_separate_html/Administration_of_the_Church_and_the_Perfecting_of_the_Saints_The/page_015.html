<p><em>Question: I will soon be forty years old. How exactly can I have better coordination with the brothers in the church in order to be a good testimony? The brothers feel that I am disobedient. I have prayed concerning this, but this is my natural disposition. Whenever I am not in the spirit, problems arise. What should I do?<em></p>
<p>Answer: We always expect everything in the church to be ideal. We want the elders to be like Peter, the apostles to be like Paul, and the saints to be like Timothy and Mary so that we can have better coordination. We think that we will have good coordination in an ideal church with ideal saints and ideal conditions. However, where in the universe can we find such an ideal church? Instead, there are &ldquo;donkeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;monkeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;chickens,&rdquo; &ldquo;dragonflies,&rdquo; &ldquo;birds,&rdquo; and &ldquo;beasts&rdquo; in the churches, and it is not easy to coordinate. We may want to coordinate with Peter, but instead we must coordinate with monkeys. We should not expect to have better coordination. Some saints expect to find better coordination, so they go from one place to another only to find that no place is as good as the first place. There is no ideal church on the earth.</p>
<p>No one can deny that you love the Lord. But because you love the Lord, you have a strong hope to pursue the ideal. Your love for the Lord supports you to be for the Lord and to want better coordination and a better testimony; hence, you hope to find a place on earth that is better than the New Jerusalem. We must understand that there is no such place. We must simply coordinate with the saints whom the Lord has measured out to us. If they are donkeys, we should coordinate with them; if they are monkeys, we should coordinate with them; if they are chickens, we should coordinate with them; and if they are angels, we should coordinate with them. We should be able to coordinate with anyone without distinction. This is our need. Otherwise, we will not find anyone on earth to coordinate with. God will not create an ideal environment for us. Would our coordination be needed in such an ideal church where the elders are like Peter, the apostles are like Paul, the brothers are like Timothy, and the sisters are like Mary? Would we be needed there?</p>
<p>We all have such a problem. Those who are in Manila want to go to Taipei, and those who are in Taipei want to go to Anaheim. But when they arrive in Anaheim, they sigh, saying that they must wait for the New Jerusalem, because Anaheim is no better than Taipei. I am afraid that they will even be disappointed in the New Jerusalem. It is for this reason that Brother Watchman Nee once said, &ldquo;If you cannot coordinate with those in the church in your locality, you cannot coordinate with anyone. If you want to learn the lesson, stay where you are; do not go to another place.&rdquo; If we cannot learn the lesson in one place, we will not learn it anywhere else. There is no ideal church, nor are there ideal elders. If there were such a situation, we would not be needed.</p>
<p>Concerning being disobedient, we all are disobedient by nature. However, you were disobedient because the brothers did not meet your demands or your standard. They rightly said that you are disobedient, but they did not understand that you are still dreaming of an ideal church with ideal elders. Therefore, your disobedience might not have been deliberate. I hope you will soon wake up from your unfulfillable dream.</p>
<p>You say that you will soon be forty years old. You are anxious that you will run out of time, but the Lord is more anxious than you are. However, the Lord is also patient and can wait for you to wake up from your dream. You love the Lord and are willing to pay the price; however, if you do not come out of your old temperament and old views, that is, wake up from your idealistic dream, you will make the Lord wait until you are sixty years old or even eighty years old.</p>
<p>We should not be idealistic; we are not yet in the new heaven and the new earth. Many of us have this problem. We should not think too much, nor should we expect too much. We should learn to praise and thank the Lord for where He has arranged for us to be. The elders are good, the brothers are good, and the sisters are good. Whether or not they are qualified is the Lord&rsquo;s business, not ours. We should learn to praise Him more.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLYGYNY,<br />
REMARRIAGE, AND SERVICE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Indonesia is a country that practices polygyny. Can a person who practices polygyny serve after he is saved?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This question is easy to answer. A polygynist can definitely serve after he is saved. The more he serves the better. However, he cannot be given an outward position, because his status of having more than one wife violates God&rsquo;s ordination. The principle in the Bible for an elder or a deacon is for him to be the husband of only one wife (1 Tim. 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6). Although this brother&rsquo;s status may not be right, we still need to give him the opportunity to serve, but it must be without a position. We must do our best to avoid giving him a position.</p>
<p>We should not pay much attention to position in the service of the church. Suppose a small church has nine sisters and six brothers, and each of the six brothers is divorced and remarried. The church still needs some of those brothers to be responsible ones, because there is no other way. However, if more brothers are gained for the testimony of the church, we need to find brothers with a simpler status to be responsible ones. The church is high and has high principles, and we should give people a good impression. However, there is no law. If possible, the elders and deacons in the church should have a clean status lest the reputation of the church be defiled or implicated. We do not need to focus on position, because the important thing in the service of the church is reality, not position.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
