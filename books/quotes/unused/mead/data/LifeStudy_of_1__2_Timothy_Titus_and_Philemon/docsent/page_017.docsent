   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Their Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 15 Paul concludes, "But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Childbearing is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suffering restricts and protects the fallen one from transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The grammar in verse 15 is rather unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the beginning of the verse Paul says, "She shall be saved"; then he goes on to say, "if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The pronoun "she" refers to Eve in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason Paul changes from a singular to a plural pronoun was that in referring to Eve he was including all women.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not all women are included in the pronoun "she," but none can deny that they are included in the pronoun "they."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul's use of pronouns in this verse makes it clear that in speaking of Eve he is speaking of all women.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 15 Paul mentions faith, love, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Faith is to receive the Lord John 1:12 , love is to enjoy Him John 14:21, 23 , and holiness is to express Him through sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By faith we please God Heb 11:6 , by love we keep the Lord's word John 14:23 , and by holiness we see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Heb 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message I am especially burdened concerning modesty, the leading female virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In some families there is not adequate stress on modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, both boys and girls are brought up and instructed in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Modesty is a virtue which emphasizes the difference between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have pointed out, the Greek word rendered "modesty" in 2:9 is literally shamefastness, that is, bound and made fast by an honorable shame.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A word related to the virtue of modesty is shamefacedness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be shamefaced is to be modest and have a sense of shame and know how to show shame.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a sister speaks in a church meeting, she should do so with modesty, with a certain amount of shamefacedness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Modesty is a great safeguard and protection to a female.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a mistake to teach girls in the same way as boys.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Boys may expose themselves in certain situations; girls, however, should not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, they will be without protection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This lack of protection can open the way for fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the women working in an office have the virtue of modesty, they will be free from any improper involvement with the men who work there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A woman working in an office may easily become involved with a man if she does not have the proper covering, the necessary modesty, shamefacedness, which causes her to keep a proper distance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the sisters in the church life should have the virtue of modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sisters should dress according to the principle of modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This principle does not allow the exposure of one's body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For a woman to expose her body is to go against the principle of modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A sister needs to have a head covering, not only physically, but also psychologically, ethically, morally, and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the modesty spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be modest simply means that a female is fully covered in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church life the brothers and sisters have quite a lot of contact with one another in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such fellowship it is necessary for the sisters to wear a moral, ethical, and spiritual covering known as modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In all their contact with the brothers, the sisters should be covered with an "overcoat" of modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a great safeguard and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sisters should never forget that they are females.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This must be true especially of young unmarried sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should be careful not to allow any evil thing to defile their holy body, which has been separated unto God and which is the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For a young woman to preserve her body in this way requires modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I advise all the young sisters to wear a heavenly cloak to cover themselves from the influence of this evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then they will be preserved for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the time appointed by God, He will arrange for the right brother to marry a young sister as a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Again and again I would remind the sisters to wear a cloak of modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sisters must always remember that they are females.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As females it is necessary for them to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Along with modesty, the sisters need sobriety 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a sister is practicing modesty, she needs to be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Far from being foolish, she should be sober-minded and discreet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She should be clear about things and have a keen discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A sister should be quiet, but she should not be without sobriety and discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A sister should be quiet soberly, not foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a sister exercises herself to be quiet and not to overstep her position, she needs a keen discernment within.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Her spiritual sky should be clear, without clouds or smog.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then she will be clear, careful, and discreet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The two virtues of modesty and sobriety are of great importance in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The sisters should attend the church meetings in order to gain the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This knowledge will cause them to be sober in their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, along with their modesty, they will have what Paul calls "holiness with sobriety" 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will not be holy in a foolish way, in a way devoid of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the contrary, they will be holy in a way that is full of knowledge, understanding, and discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the first two chapters of 1 Timothy Paul gives practical instructions to have a proper local church: 1 terminate the distraction of differing teachings 1:3-11 ; 2 emphasize God's dispensation, making it the central line and goal of the Christian life 1:4-6 ; 3 preach Christ to save sinners 1:12-17 ; 4 war a good warfare for God's New Testament economy by holding faith and a good conscience 1:18-19 ; 5 deal with the heretical teachers and the opposers of the apostle 1:20 ; 6 let the leading ones take the lead to have a prayer life, interceding for all men that Christ's redemption may be testified in due time 2:1-7 ; 7 let the brothers follow the pattern of prayer, praying all the time 2:8 ; and 8 let the sisters adorn themselves in proper deportment and subject themselves to the brothers, remaining in quietness, faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.</S>
