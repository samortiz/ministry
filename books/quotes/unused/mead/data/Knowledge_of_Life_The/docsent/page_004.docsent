   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. LIFE IS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us that life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It shows us even more that life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Life was God; then God became flesh, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, Christ is God, and Christ also is life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The life which was God, the life that God is, is in Him John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, Christ said again and again that He is life John 14:6; 11:25 , and that He came to earth that man may have life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Bible says that he that has Him has life 1 John 5:12 , and that He in us is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as life is God Himself, so also life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as having life is having God Himself, so also having life is having Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as to live out life is to live out God Himself, so also to live out life is to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as life is not different in the least from God, likewise life is not different in the least from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as a slight deviation from God is not life, likewise a slight deviation from Christ is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For Christ is God being life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is through Christ and as Christ that God is manifested as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Christ is life and life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>LIFE IS THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the Lord Jesus said He was life in John 14:6, He made known to His disciples not only that He and God are one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>7-11 , but also that the Holy Spirit and He are also one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord referred to the Holy Spirit as he, but in verse 18, He changed the pronoun from he to I. By changing the he to I the Lord was saying that he is I. This reveals that the Holy Spirit He spoke of in verses 16 and 17 is He Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From verses 7 to 11 He showed us that He is the embodiment of God He is in God, and God is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, His being life means that God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From verses 16 to 20, He further revealed that the Holy Spirit is His embodiment, His other form; and when His physical presence leaves us, this Spirit of reality Who is Himself as another comforter comes into us and abides with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Spirit living in us and abiding with us is just He Himself living in us as our life that we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two passages therefore show us that it is by God being in Him and Him being the Holy Spirit that He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is in Him as life, and He is the Holy Spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Him being life is God being life, and is also the Holy Spirit being life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, John 4:10, 14 tells us that the living water which He gives is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 7:38-39 further tells us that the living water which flows out from us is the Holy Spirit which we received.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This discloses that the Holy Spirit is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit we receive is the eternal life we experience, or Christ being experienced by us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The eternal life, or Christ as life, is to be experienced by us as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life because God and Christ being life hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He and life are united as one and cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is of life, and life is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life is His content, and He is the reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Speaking more accurately, He is not only the reality of life, but also life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all know that God is a triune God Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father is in the Son; the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Father in the Son is manifested among men; therefore, the Son is the manifestation of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Son as the Spirit enters into man; therefore, the Spirit is the entering in of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Father is the source of life, the very life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Son is the manifestation of the Father 1 Tim 3:16 , He is the manifestation of life 1 John 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And since the Spirit is the entering in of the Son, He is the entering in of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Life originally is the Father; in the Son, it is manifested among man; and as the Spirit, it enters into man for man to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the Spirit becomes the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the Spirit is the Spirit of life, man can receive life through the Spirit, and when man sets his mind on the Spirit, it is life Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since the Spirit is the Spirit of life, when man exercises his spirit to touch the Spirit, he touches life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he contacts the Spirit, he contacts life, and when he obeys the Spirit, he experiences life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, in summary, life is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But to us, life is not the Triune God in heaven, but the Triune God flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This flowing out of the Triune God means that His content, which is Himself, first flowed out through Christ; then it flowed out as the Spirit to be received by us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, when we touch God in Christ as the Spirit, we touch life, for life is God in Christ as the Spirit.</S>
