   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What should be our view, our feeling, and our attitude toward what the Lord is raising up here?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Your fellowship is more concerned with what we have received and the Lord's sovereign arrangement, but what should be our view and our attitude toward what the Lord is doing here in the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: This is a very good point.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanly speaking, we must keep a governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever church raised us up, sent us, and has been supporting us through the years expects us to go back to serve there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to this governing principle, we should go back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not take the excuse that because a wonderful work has been started here, there is the need for us to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must keep the governing principle in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot do a right thing by breaking a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This would not be of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there might be an exception, so we must fellowship with our supporting church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is a work here that really needs us, this work should also fellowship with that supporting church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we, our supporting church, and the work here, all three parties, should fellowship together to seek the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not mean that any party should insist on having something only for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All three involved should fellowship with each other to seek the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This situation may be considered as an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, in principle, all of us should go back to fulfill our obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to the work of the trainees for the past two terms, some of the localities here have been helped very much, and some new churches have been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If some of the trainees should go back according to the principle, those of us here will make some arrangements to take care of this local need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not like to see any work that has been raised up here become like an "orphan" because we feel obligated to go back to the church which supports us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We would surely like to take care of this in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all have to realize that, in principle, the training here would not take care of a certain work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The training here has a unique purpose to train young people to grow in life, in the truth, in capacity, and to transform their character.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As to the work, this is altogether a matter between the trainees and their supporting churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, the training here might be misunderstood as a kind of center for a certain work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The training here does have the burden to train young people for all of the churches in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The training here has no intention to train people for a work of the training or a work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The training has only one purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is to train the young people in the Lord's recovery for the benefit of all the churches in the Lord's recovery by having the trainees return to their sending churches to serve and work with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The training is a part of the ministry, and the ministry has no intention to build up any work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ministry's intention is just to help the building up of the churches.</S>
