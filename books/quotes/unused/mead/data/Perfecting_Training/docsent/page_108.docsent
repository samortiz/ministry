   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX HAVING OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past few messages we have entered into several vital points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law of the Spirit of life has been installed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This law is just the Triune God, who, after being processed and becoming the life-giving Spirit, indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have such a processed God and such an indwelling God who is now the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TWO LAWS AND TWO TREES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a recent conference we had three messages telling us how that God is the positive law within us, and Satan is the negative law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is the law of the Spirit of life, and Satan is the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Two laws have been installed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The negative law came first.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan as the law of sin and of death was installed into our being first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then God, after passing through all the processes, became the life-giving Spirit and was installed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that conference we also pointed out that these two laws are very much related to the two trees in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law of the Spirit of life is the operation of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law of sin and of death is the operation of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law of the Spirit of life has been installed into us, and this law is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this is not the raw God, but the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not the God in Genesis 1, but the God at the end of Matthew 28.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matthew 28:19 reads, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The God into whom we have been baptized is the very God who is now in us as the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>WORKING WITHIN US BY LAWS NOT BY ACTIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another vital point that we have covered in the past weeks is this: since God as the processed God who became the indwelling Spirit has been installed into our being, He works within us not by activities but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must realize that this is one of the biggest discoveries, even recoveries, in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since God, the processed God, has been installed into our being, He works within us not by any activity but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This makes a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through all the centuries few Christians have seen that God is working in His chosen and redeemed people not by activity but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nearly all Christians pray that God would do something in them by activity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they have a bad temper, they pray that the Lord would help them to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me illustrate once again with the matter of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day electricity was installed into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since that day if we need any heating or cooling or power to operate certain kinds of appliances, all we need to do is flip the switch fulfilling the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To kneel down and pray, calling on the power plant or calling upon the mighty God in the heavens, does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless of how earnestly you may pray, you are praying in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All you need to do is to fulfill the principle of the operation of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle of the operation of electricity is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a law in the installed electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You simply need to go to the switch and fulfill the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once you fulfill the law, the electricity works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So electricity works not by activity but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The power plant serves you not by activity but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By this illustration you can understand that since God has been installed into us, He works in us not by activity but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can all testify that it seems God didn t answer our prayers concerning our temper and other things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, the more we prayed the worse we became.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many Christians have prayed to overcome the besetting sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But it seems the more they pray to overcome the besetting sins, the more they get beset and entangled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is little result in this kind of prayer because this kind of prayer is against the principle of the law.</S>
