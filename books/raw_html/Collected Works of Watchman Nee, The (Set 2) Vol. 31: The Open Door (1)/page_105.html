<h2 class="head2">Ping-Du, Shantung Province</h2><p>Peace to my dearest brother in the Lord, X:</p><p>I received your letter and learned everything. In my heart, I do not want to live in Hong Kong. But since the Lord has loved me so much, in these last days, I should love Him and take up my own cross to preach the gospel. I do not understand Cantonese or English, so I would not be able to testify for Him. I would be willing to go to Hunan or Szechuan for the following reasons. First, I would have the opportunity to do some holy work. Second, both male and female students can study in schools set up by the Lord. Third, I can follow the example of the apostle Paul's work. If the Lord prepares a brother in the Lord as a partner with me in business, we could set up a milk processing plant or some other business. If the Lord does not allow me to do business, I am also willing to preach the gospel for a living. I believe that God is trustworthy. Property and money cannot be relied on in this evil world. I have given everything to Christ and will follow His leading. My father sent a letter from Ning-Po asking me to return to manage the family business and property. According to the flesh, I would be well off in clothing, food, and lodging, but I really do not want to enjoy the pleasures of sin in Egypt. I would rather lead a life of suffering in the wilderness together with the Lord. I hope that you will pray for me. Wherever the Lord allows me to go, I would ask you to please send me a letter with clear directions. There has been no communication for the past two months in eastern Shantung, so I do not know anything. It takes twenty days for a letter to get here from Chefoo. May the Lord's grace be with your wife and children, amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Tsou Shing-Wu<br />February 27<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Brother Tsou: Where do you want to go in Hunan or Szechuan? You could read the addresses listed for the work and the churches in Hunan and Szechuan. If you want to go to a place where there are brothers and sisters, you could write to them directly yourself and ask them how to get there. You could also find out their general condition&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Jiao County, Shantung Province</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I am at home living in grace in all things. The Lord heard our prayers in the past. I believe that the Lord will also continue to grace me unceasingly. I received a letter from Sister Cheng last month and learned about the condition of the assembly in Shanghai. It is too bad that the mail service is so inconvenient; it has prevented me from receiving more of the Local Newsletters. How discouraging it is to be kept away from the knowledge of the brothers' and sisters' situations! I hope that the Lord will give me another chance to enjoy meeting with you before the Lord. I feel really dry and long for the sisters' meetings. Praise the Lord. His presence is with me. Have Mr. and Mrs. Luan already arrived in Chungking? Are Mr. and Mrs. Yuan doing well? How has Mr. Chang Yu-zhi's health been? Greet Miss Chang for me.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Yu Fang-rue<br />February 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Mr. and Mrs. Luan are still in Hong Kong. Mr. Yuan is in Hankow. Mrs. Yuan is still in Chungking. She will return to Hankow during summer vacation. Brother Yu-zhi's health is much better&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-An, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to my dear brothers in the Lord,</p><p>I was overjoyed to receive one copy of the second issue of The Open Door at the end of December last year. It helped me spiritually and also gave me much urgently needed news. Thank the Lord! In this time of war, there is more of a need for putting out this kind of publication. Through it God's children can communicate with each other, instead of worrying about one another. Brother Yu told me something about the situation of the brothers and sisters in Tsinan, but I did not know where they had gone and wanted to find out something about them by any means. Thank the Lord. This publication completely dispelled the worry from my heart. I know that they are all safe. My sister, Ms. Wen You-sin, and I have not left Tai-An yet. We are all safe because we work for the Methodist Church. We are believers, and we obey the authorities; therefore, we do not worry; rather, we have peace in our heart to rely on the Lord and remain here. All the denominations have set up refugee centers for women and children. They have met the need of many believers and refugees. I am very busy working for a women and children's center. Please do not worry about me. I greet you with peace in the Lord! I have not had any news about Brother Shao Teh-sen of Canton and Mr. and Mrs. Pan Hwei-sheng of Nanking. Please print something about them in The Open Door. Sister Liu Shu-yuan is safe in Gao-Mi. She is recovering from her illness. Where are Brother Lee Tze-jung and Brother Witness Lee of Chefoo? Please print their news.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Liang Chian-buo<br />February 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Brother Witness Lee is in Chefoo. Brother Lee Tze-jung is in Tsingtao. Mr. and Mrs. Pan have already returned to Amoy. Brother Shao Teh-sen is at the Hwei-Ai Hospital, Lien-Chow, Canton&mdash;Editor.)</p>
