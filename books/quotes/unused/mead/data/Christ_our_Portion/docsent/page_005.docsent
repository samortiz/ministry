   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE REALITY OF BEING IN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10; 8:1-2, 9-10; 10:6-8; 1 Cor 6:17 RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF CHRIST AND SAVED IN HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:10 says, "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse two important things are mentioned: His death and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through the fall of Adam we became enemies to God, but through the death of Christ we were reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now, having been reconciled, we shall be saved more and more by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The death of Christ was sufficient for us to be reconciled to God, and the life of Christ is good for us to be saved from many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST IN YOU THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE BOOK OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ in you is the central point of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8:9-10 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The book of Romans tells us that Christ was put on the cross in order to accomplish redemption 3:24; 4:25 , He was then resurrected from among the dead 4:25 , and then He ascended to the heavens 8:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here in Romans 8:10 the Christ who was put on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the central point of the whole book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, Romans 8:9-10 reveals three divine titles: the Spirit of God v. 9 , the Spirit of Christ v. 9 , and Christ Himself v. 10 . This simply means that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>FIRST CORINTHIANS AS THE ENTRANCE TO COLOSSIANS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to understand the book of Colossians, 1 Corinthians and Colossians must be combined together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without 1 Corinthians there is no entrance to the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is the need to combine these books because both of them reveal that Christ Himself is our divine portion 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 30; Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians tells us that Christ, the portion allotted to us, is our wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Righteousness is for our spirit to be regenerated, sanctification is for our soul to be transformed, and redemption is for our body to be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The day we received Christ as our Savior, He became our righteousness, we were justified through Him, and by this justification, our spirit was regenerated Rom 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The regeneration of our spirit has been accomplished through the righteousness of God which is just Christ Himself Rom 3:22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the time we were regenerated until the present day, we have been in the process of sanctification, which is the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now our soul must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ultimately, in the future when the Lord returns, our body will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our body will be transfigured, not only by Christ but with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is regeneration to our spirit, Christ is the transformation to our soul, and Christ is the transfiguration to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ has been allotted to us by God as our unsearchably rich portion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If 1 Corinthians revealed only this much to us, we would still need a door, an entrance, in order to enter into and realize all of these wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in 15:45 we are told that this Christ, who is the portion allotted to us by God, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word concerning Christ being the life-giving Spirit is one of the most crucial truths in the entire New Testament.</S>
