   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MORAVIAN BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then there was a further move of the Lord through His lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many believers began simply to adopt the title the brothers or the brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, this term was not firstly adopted by the British Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was adopted even before the time of Zinzendorf, mostly in northern Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Moravian brothers came to Zinzendorf, they began to have a church life outside of Catholicism and absolutely outside of the organized Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, the Moravian brothers and many others suffered persecution from two sources the Catholic Church and the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These brothers were compelled to go to Bohemia to Zinzendorf.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He took the lead to establish a very good church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the church life in Bohemia was not fully according to the Bible, it was still very much according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE BRETHREN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Approximately one century later, the Brethren in England were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They came out of the organization of both the Catholic and Protestant churches to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They dropped everything of hierarchy and denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was a very strong reaction to the papal system, the Episcopalian system, and the Protestant system.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They stressed the Body very much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They saw very little, however, of the principle of the resurrection life for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At least they did not see what we see today concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did see, though, that the church was the Body of Christ and they stressed the Body greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, seeking Christians were raised up who concentrated on the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They also reacted to the papal system and to the Protestant organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, a "loose" condition was produced among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of the seeking Christians began to oppose any kind of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They did not regard or respect anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Due to the rise of democratic forms of government, another factor which invaded the Christian concept was that the church should be democratic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks began to see that most Christians neglected the matter of spiritual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His understanding was based upon the spiritual authority in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, in our physical body there is the authority in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the members obey the headship, the authority of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The head directs all the members of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Beginning with Brother Sparks, the stress on spiritual authority came out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Nee saw the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Brother Nee wrote the book Spiritual Authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I never read this book, because actually, before Brother Nee wrote the book, he talked to me personally about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He told me its entire contents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we receive any teaching carelessly, this can always cause some subsidiary mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many outsiders use Brother Nee's teaching on spiritual authority as their ground to exercise, not their spiritual authority, but their human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They do not exercise the authority in life but the authority by organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There has also been a by-product among us of such a subsidiary mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This by-product is the thought that a certain brother is the first among the co-workers or that another brother is the first among the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should practice the church life according to the instruction of the New Testament, not in a legal way, but in the way of life with love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must realize that the church life can only be practiced rightly in life with love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Any instruction given by the New Testament concerning the church life should be kept in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are out of life, you are through with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is not a matter of organization or regulation but altogether a matter of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Life in the New Testament and especially in the Epistles means the resurrection life, which is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church must be practiced by our being in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many Christians are missing the mark because they do not care for this life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They care for the Bible doctrines and instructions in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They study the Bible instructions and teachings concerning their religion just like the lawyers studying law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not take the Word of God, however, merely according to the black and white letters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to get into its spirit, and the spirit of the New Testament is the resurrected Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The constitution of the church life is not a number of regulations like the constitution of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The constitution of the church life is of the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is of life, it is a matter of life, and its element must be life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we practice the church, we must practice it in the resurrection life.</S>
