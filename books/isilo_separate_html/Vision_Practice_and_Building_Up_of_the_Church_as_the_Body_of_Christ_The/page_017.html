Keeping the Order in the Body<br />
by Being Faithful in Their Own Functions</h2>
<p>As we have said, the members are of three main classes: the joints, the sinews, and all the other parts. The joints are for supply, for nourishment, the sinews are for knitting and uniting, and all the rest of the members are for the different kinds of operations. All these three classes of members must be under the headship of Christ. If we are joints, we must do our duty to supply and to nourish, and if we are sinews, we must be faithful to join the Body together in love. In the Body we need the joints to supply and the sinews to knit together. The joints cannot knit together; they are good only for nourishing and supplying. There is the need of a group of sinews to bind and knit together all the members. Many times the members need the supply, but after they are supplied, they need someone to join, knit, and bind them together. The problem today is that many want to be only the joints to supply but not the sinews to knit together. When this is the case, we have nourishment, but we are lacking the knitting. Even the more, we lack the many other operations of the members. For each kind of member to be faithful is the proper way to keep the order in the Body. We all agree that we must be under the headship, but we may not properly keep the order in the Body. If we are out of our function, we are out of the proper order. We may be a sinew that tries to supply or a joint that tries to knit together. If so, then we are out of our function and not in the proper order.</p>
<p>Many today talk about the &ldquo;Body ministry.&rdquo; At first I thought that this was a good term, but now I do not like to use it. When many people speak of the Body ministry, they are referring to meetings in which everyone opens his mouth to say something, as if the Body had only a mouth with no eyes, ears, nose, or other members. It is an ugly thing for the eyes of the Body to try to speak. The most beautiful situation is that the hands do the work of the hands, and the feet do the work of the feet. The Body ministry is not merely a speaking ministry. The genuine Body ministry is all the members of the Body functioning in various ways.</p>
<p>God created only one mouth in our body. If there were two mouths, they may quarrel with each other. On the one hand, 1 Corinthians 14:31 says that all can prophesy, so we must all prophesy properly. On the other hand, though, the foot should not function as the mouth. We may have the wrong sense as to whether or not we are the mouth, but the other members can discern. If the foot tries to function as the mouth, the members will sense that something is wrong. They may say, &ldquo;Brother, simply be a foot. That is sufficient. Do not try to be the mouth.&rdquo; The ministry of the Body is not that everyone speaks to function as the mouth. Rather, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 tell us that the Body has many members, and all the members do not have the same function (Rom. 12:3-5; 1 Cor. 12:14-17).</p>
<p>There is a certain brother among us through whom many people have been saved. He always realizes what and who he is, so he prepares a meal in his home and invites people, but he does not try to speak to them. Rather, along with the unbelievers he also invites certain brothers and sisters to speak. This is the proper coordination and cooperation of the differing operations. Even in gospel preaching we need this kind of coordination. If one person is a mouth but he cannot prepare a meal in his home, he needs the cooperation of the Body in order to preach the gospel. This is a small illustration of the proper ministry in the Body. The genuine Body ministry is the mouth speaking, the hands working, and all the members in their operation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Operation of the Members in the Proper Order<br />
Having a Living Effect on People</h2>
<p>We all are under the headship of Christ, but we need to learn to keep the order in the Body. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we know what we are and where we are, and we remain there, this will be a great help for the building up of the Body. There is no doubt that we all have the sincere desire to build up the church, but to do this we must keep the proper order. If we are the sinews, we have to keep this order; if we are the joints, we need to do our duty; and if we are one of the other members, we must operate within our measure. This will have a living effect on people. The main thing that impresses people is not our messages but the situation in our meetings. This is a matter of the true building up. This situation among us must be enriched, uplifted, strengthened, and improved. To this end we look to the Lord for His protection. The enemy is not willing to see the prevailing building up of the Body on this earth and in our locality. Nevertheless, the Lord will work this out. Then it will be very easy to bring people to be saved. They may be saved as soon as they come into the meeting. It will also be easy for other Christians to come in. When they come into the meeting, they will be impressed. They will realize that something is different. In actuality, what they will sense is the real building up.</p>
<p>The Lord will work this out not only in one locality but also in every place where the seeking ones are. This is a matter not of mere doctrine nor of something outward but of the real building up in life. Nothing can prevail against this. The Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). The true built-up church is the strongest testimony of the Lord. We all must realize the need today. We are under the headship of Christ, but we also must learn to know and to keep the proper order in the Body. This will result in the genuine building up. Then through this the Lord will bring others into the same order, and Christ will head up all things in Himself. This requires that we be built up together.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
