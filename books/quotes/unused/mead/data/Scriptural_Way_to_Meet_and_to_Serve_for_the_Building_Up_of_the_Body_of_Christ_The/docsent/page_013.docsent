   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Considering One Another</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and in Exhorting One Another</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 10:24 says, And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Considering one another indicates mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I take care of you, and you take care of me this is mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Exhorting one another in verse 25 also indicates mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, exhortation is mutual; it is not just in one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With exhortation there should be a two-way traffic as indicated by the words one another in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the meetings of Christianity, exhortation is usually from one direction from the pastor to the congregation; there is no exhortation which goes back to the pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when we meet, our exhortation must be among ourselves; it must be mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Teaching and in Admonishing</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Teaching and admonishing is also in mutuality Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We speak to one another, teaching and admonishing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes, the sisters could admonish the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sisters should not say that because they are not teachers, they cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should not teach 1 Tim 2:12 , but they should admonish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We admonish one another because we love each other.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are members of the same Body, so I admonish you and you admonish me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was young, I discovered that some Christian teachers said that females could teach in the church meetings, but others said that they could not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day in Los Angeles in 1963, a brother who was knowledgeable of the Bible attended our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he observed that the sisters spoke in the meetings, he asked me why we allowed the sisters to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said that the sisters should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I responded by asking him whether or not the sisters were silent in his meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said that they were.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I then asked him if the sisters sang in his meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He affirmed that they did.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I asked him whether or not singing was a kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, as long as the sisters were singing in his meeting, they were not actually silent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then I asked why the sisters were allowed to sing and were not allowed to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How strange this was!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is strange that the sisters were qualified to sing hymns, but not qualified to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to 1 Corinthians 11:5, however, women may pray and prophesy in the meeting, but they must do this under the covering of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sisters must be emancipated to speak in the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They must be encouraged to speak, but not in terms of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sisters should not teach, but they can exhort and admonish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times, mothers can admonish their children better than fathers; likewise, the sisters are usually very skillful in admonishing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because the sisters are fine, not rough or coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers, on the other hand, may be rough and coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the brothers say Amen, it can be very rough.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, when the sisters say Amen, it can be like music, very pleasant to our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since admonishing is a fine work, it is sometimes very difficult for the brothers to admonish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a brother, teaching is very easy for me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I may not be as qualified to admonish as some of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the brothers admonish, the saints may not listen very much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when a dear sister comes and admonishes, everyone may listen and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This illustrates why we need the sisters to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as they would speak and not teach, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the sisters should be encouraged to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of the sisters need to be emancipated, not from man s control but from their own control.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many sisters control themselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is always good for a sister to be quiet, gentle, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I agree with and appreciate this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I do not agree that the sisters mouths would be shut in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sisters need to be gentle and meek, but speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>PAYING A HIGH PRICE TO REACH THE STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To reach the standard of these characteristics of the believers meetings requires that we pay a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must endeavor to reach this highest standard so that our meetings could be revolutionized, bearing the proper characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once our meetings are converted from the old way into the new way, the Lord will have something according to His New Testament economy.</S>
