   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL S DESIRE TO BE WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 23 says, But I am constrained by the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it rather is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Paul wrote these words, he was in bonds suffering mistreatment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Under those circumstances, we would expect him to long to be with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any believer in Paul s situation would have the same desire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have indicated that to be with Christ is a matter of degree, not of place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt, Paul was with Christ in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fact that he was already with Christ indicates that being with Christ is not a matter of place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But although Paul was with Christ to a certain degree, he desired to be with Him in a higher degree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul knew that as a result of physical death he would be with Christ to a greater extent than in his earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, he could desire to depart and to be with Christ, regarding this as much better.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>REMAINING FOR THE SAINTS PROGRESS AND JOY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 24 Paul continues, But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words your sake mean for the sake of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The apostle s consideration was not selfish, but was for the sake of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was absolutely occupied by the Lord with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul realized that the churches needed more of the ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For their sake, he would remain in order to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was a person full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he spoke, he spoke Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he lived, he lived with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he worked, he worked with Christ and ministered Christ to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the sake of the church, he was willing to remain in the flesh that he might minister Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 25 says, And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The faith here refers to what the saints believe in Jude 3; 2 Tim 4:7 ; progress, to the growth in life; and joy, to the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was willing to remain for the sake of the saints progress and joy of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is possible to be a Christian for years without having any progress or joy, without growing in life and without enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need both the growth in life and the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have known some saints who have been faithful to stay in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But with them there have been little growth in life and little enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, they have had little progress and little joy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What can you say about your progress and your joy?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Oh, we need the progress and the enjoyment!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether Paul was in prison or out of prison, he was a strong factor of the saints progress and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of him the churches could have the growth in life and could be filled with the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This should also be true of us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the elders in the local churches should be factors of the saints growth in life and of their enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But whether or not the elders are such factors of progress and joy depends on whether or not they magnify Christ by living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the elders live Christ, He will surely be magnified in them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the elders will become factors to enable the saints to grow in life and enjoy the Lord.</S>
