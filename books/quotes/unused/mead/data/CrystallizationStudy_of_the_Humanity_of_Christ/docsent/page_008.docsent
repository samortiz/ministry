   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We want to continue our fellowship concerning the humanity of Christ in the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This message presents Christ appearing as a man four times in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament Christ was prophesied as a man, particularly in four cases.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, Christ as a man in His humanity visited His friend, Abraham Gen 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, Christ as a man in His humanity wrestled with Jacob, a heel-holder Gen 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, Christ as a man in His humanity met Joshua, the general of God's army, to fight not only for Israel but for the carrying out of God's eternal economy Josh 5:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fourth, Christ as a man in His humanity came purposely to the wife of a common man by the name of Manoah to tell her that she would bring forth a son by the name of Samson to fight for Israel Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Samson would fight the Philistines, signifying a people between the world and religion, who greatly disrupted the carrying out of God's economy on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is hard to find out the reason why Christ appeared as a man in these four cases.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I want us to notice the following phrase which is written four times in the outline of this message: for the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to carry out God's economy, Christ needs to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. Christ Visiting Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>as a Man in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God became Abraham's friend.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God would have visited Abraham as God, this would have frightened Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As God He could not become friends with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God came as God to be friends with us, we would run away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our crystallization-study of Song of Songs, we saw that God came as a "country man" in order to court a "country girl."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day God came to visit Abraham, not as God, but as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ was Jehovah, but He came to Abraham as a man with two angels Gen 18:1-3, 9-14, 16-18, 22, 33; 19:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Abraham might have wondered who this One was who came as a guest to his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He provided Him with water for foot-washing and asked his wife to prepare a meal for Him 18:4-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As God He would not have needed to wash His feet or to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He told Abraham that his wife Sarah would bring forth a son in the next year vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>9-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time Abraham was about one hundred years old Rom 4:19 , and Sarah's age prevented her from bearing children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, there was One who told Abraham that He would come back and that Sarah would have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, the birth of the son would be His coming back Gen 18:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Considering that Abraham would become a great nation to be the kingdom of God on the earth for the carrying out of God's economy, Christ told Abraham as His friend James 2:23; 2 Chron 20:7; Isa 41:8 that He would judge the sinful Sodom and Gomorrah Gen 18:16-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham prayed to Jehovah for Sodom; actually, his prayer was for his nephew, Lot, who made his home in Sodom vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>22-33 , and Jehovah answered him by rescuing Lot from the destruction of Sodom 19:1-29 .</S>
