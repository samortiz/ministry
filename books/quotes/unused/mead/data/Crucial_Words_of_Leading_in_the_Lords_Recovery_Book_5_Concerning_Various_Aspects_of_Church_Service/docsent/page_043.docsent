   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ELDERS AND THE DEACONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no rank in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The relationship between the elders and the deacons involves everyone fulfilling his respective responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have been in human society for so long that we all have the concept of a social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, as soon as elders and deacons are mentioned, we spontaneously bring in the concept of a social organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We feel that the elders are high and the deacons are low, or that the elders give orders and the deacons take orders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This ranking system is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result of this matter, I have spent time studying the New Testament again in detail, and the Lord has given me clear light to see that there were no leaders in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the apostles were appointed, no one was appointed as a chief apostle among them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the elders and deacons were appointed, there was no chief elder or chief deacon appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Having No Distinction of Order or Rank</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible there is no distinction of rank between the elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there were such a distinction, it would mean that the higher group would rule over the lower one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this does not correspond with the word of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord said, The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant 20:25-26; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>23:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Based on this truth and principle, the British Brethren were raised up over one hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They called themselves merely brothers and did not use any title.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, others called them the Brethren Assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among them there was no order or rank; hence, there was no boss or subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There Not Being Bosses or Subordinates</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the concept of rank from society has invaded the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We still consider an elder s position to be higher and a deacon s position to be lower.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In some churches the manner in which a deacon in the business office contacts the elders is like that of a subordinate reporting to his boss.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is good that the deacons are humble, gentle, and full of love and sweetness when they give a report to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But a deacon is not a subordinate reporting to his boss.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person can be gentle, humble, and kind in their demeanor without the flavor of subordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must remove every vestige of this concept in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To a certain extent the elders and co-workers have the attitude that they are a special class in the church, that they are higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although they do not say this nor do they make a show of it, they still have a superior attitude, according to my observation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I express such a flavor in my going out and coming in among you, please tell me, and I will definitely change and apologize, because it is to my shame.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul says, I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing 2 Cor 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He also says that he was less than the least of all saints Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The co-workers are the least of all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though we may accomplish much, we still have to return to the Lord s presence and remember His word in Luke 17:10: When you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the midst of the saints we should not be able to boast of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is nothing special about elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are only brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The chorus of hymn #251 in Chinese says, I am a sinner saved by grace!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have no position to assume among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not a special class of people among them; we are sinners saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the elders and co-workers do not flaunt a difference among the saints, their attitude indicates that they are different from the brothers and that they are a little higher than the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to remove such a situation from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If people who come to the church can tell who among us are the bosses and who are the subordinates, it is to our shame.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must remove the concept of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Having Responsibilities without Rank</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must believe that the Bible is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:28 that God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, and at the end helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul puts the deacons, referred to as helps, ahead of the elders, referred to as administrations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows that there is no rank between the elders and deacons and that the elders are not higher than the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They differ only in their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the responsibilities of leading, managing, shepherding, teaching, and promoting are not higher than the responsibilities of a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In society people who take care of miscellaneous matters are lower, and people who manage are higher.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not the concept in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible emphasizes the fact that each member has responsibilities, but there is no distinction as to who is higher or who is lower.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus said, The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many Matt 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should never think that the Lord Jesus is lower than us since His duty is to serve us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Generally speaking, those who are served are higher, whereas those who serve are lower.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the case in society without exception.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible is the only exception.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who serve as elders have their responsibilities, but their position is not higher than that of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who serve as deacons have their responsibilities, but their position is not lower than that of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The only thing that distinguishes us is our responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Peter says, Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God 1 Pet 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Among the brothers and sisters there can be differences in gifts but there is no difference in position.</S>
