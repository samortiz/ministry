   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEST OF MOCKERS MOCKING</S>

   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WHERE IS THE PROMISE OF HIS COMING?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 PET.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The truth is hidden from the heretical mockers by their own willfulness v. 5a . Because they are willfully ignorant, the truth in the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures is covered from their sight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Peter reminded the believers to remember the word of God spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1-2, 5b, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that to take care of such a case of heresy, we need to help the believers to hold to the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>XXXV.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE TEST OF MANY ANTICHRISTS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>HAVING COME 1 JOHN 2:18</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The antichrists deny that Jesus is the Christ v. 22 . The believers should abide in the Lord according to His anointing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To take care of this case of heresy, we need the experience of abiding in the Lord according to His anointing, and we should charge the believers not to listen to the heretical teaching, but to take care of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>XXXVI.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE TEST OF THE SPIRIT THAT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>DOES NOT CONFESS JESUS CHRIST HAVING COME</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IN THE FLESH 1 JOHN 4:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This again is a case of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit in this case is not out of God but is of the antichrist; it is not the Spirit of truth but the spirit of deception.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The antichrists are out of the world; the believers are out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The believers have overcome the false prophets in verse 1 and the antichrist in verse 3, because greater is He who is in the believers than he who is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To confront such a case of heresy, we need the experience of 1 the Triune God as the all-inclusive, anointing Spirit, who is in us, being greater than Satan as the evil spirit who is in the world, and 2 the world having been overcome by us through the indwelling Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>XXXVII.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE TEST OF A BELIEVER SEEING A BROTHER</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>SINNING A SIN NOT UNTO DEATH 1 JOHN 5:16</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He should ask, that is, pray, for the sinning one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By so doing, he will give life to such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To give life to such a one is to minister life to the sinning one in our contacting of him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This requires us to have a certain amount of the divine love to care for the sinning one, and to have a certain degree of growth in the divine life that we may have the riches of the divine life to share with him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>XXXVIII.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE TEST OF MANY DECEIVERS,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AS ANTICHRISTS, GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT CONFESSING JESUS CHRIST COMING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IN THE FLESH BUT GOING BEYOND</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TEACHING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 JOHN 7, 9-11</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the case involving the greatest heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Apostle John charged the believers not to receive the heretical antichrists into their houses and even not to say to the heretics, Rejoice! v. 10 . To say Rejoice to someone is to greet him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He who says to these heretics, Rejoice, shares in their heretical, evil works v. 11 . This is a strong quarantine exercised over the heretics who do not confess the incarnation of Christ, who came in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here there is the need of our boldness and frankness to keep the divine truth concerning Christ s divine person in His divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Any compromise in dealing with heresies concerning Christ s person should be abandoned.</S>
