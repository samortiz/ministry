During this time, God really opened the door for preaching. Local ones have gradually been raised up. The ones who have improved the most and are the best are Mr. and Mrs. Ts'ao Tze Hsien. They are local people, and they are well respected in their social status, knowledge, and occupation. Their heart for pursuing the Lord is really admirable. There are also others who are very promising. Our brothers and sisters have received much help. They heard many spiritual things that they never heard before, and we have been supplied with much food in life. Our brother is really a good mother.</P><P>Brother Chang went out once last Thursday. The day after he came back, he was not feeling very well. He had very bad diarrhea. He could not eat or drink for two days, so he became physically weak and could not get out of bed. Although he tried many cures, he was still not fully restored. Brother Chang wanted very much to return to Shanghai for rest. We did not want to let him go! But Brother Chang was determined to go home so we reluctantly let him return to Shanghai. In considering how he left, I am ashamed that I did not know how to serve him better. Although I have a home, we could not care for him or cure him. Therefore, I felt it was my fault that he was so desperate to return home. A very healthy Brother Chang came to Tsinan and a very sick Brother Chang returned to Shanghai. The brothers and sisters in Shanghai may blame us! Please forgive us. After Brother Chang returns to Shanghai, he will still need to rest. I can tell him the results of the tests on his stool sample later, as well as how he should take care of himself.</P><P>Brother Chang's departure will surely affect the work in Tsinan. The work has not been fully concluded. There are several brothers who need a little more help to make that last step; they have not come to the meetings yet. The work is more than half done, but there is still a small portion left to finish. This is really too bad. May the Lord accomplish what is left through His other servant. We hope that Brother Chang can come to Tsinan again when he has recovered from his illness. The door of our meeting and the brothers' and sisters' hearts are open and waiting for him to return to Tsinan. We ask the Lord to send him again to do the work He entrusted to him.</P><P>Brother Nee, how is your health lately? We heard the news that you also were physically weak. We pray constantly that God will give you a healthy body to finish His work. We also hope that the day will come when we can leave this body of sickness. May the Lord bless you!</P><P>Brother Chou Hsin Yi is doing very well in Tsinan. The brothers are very close to him. We also worry about his health. I will not write more. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Ch'ien Neng Sheng<br>June 28</P><P>The meeting in Tsinan:<br>Responsible brothers: P'an Hui Sheng, Ts'ai Chih Wen<br>Meeting address: We have already moved to 13-7 Kuang Chih Yuan Street, Tsinan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM HANGCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>To Brother Yueh Chiao and the brothers in Shanghai:</P><P>I am very peaceful in Hangchow. I am well in body, soul, and spirit. The brothers in Hangchow are all lovable in the sight of the Lord. Everything among the brothers is peaceful, although there is some persecution from the outside. Inwardly, there is no crack to be seen. "Filled with peace" can be used to describe the meeting in Hangchow. I have been helped by the brothers very much here. How could someone as weak and ignorant as myself help the brothers in Hangchow? But if I can receive some help from them, then I have not come in vain. My work is to fellowship more with the newly saved brothers, and sometimes there is a mutual exhortation among the brothers who walk in the same way. Finally, I want to ask you a favor; your little brother who is so weak and ignorant needs your prayers more than ever, so that I will not shame the Lord's name and so that I can serve them faithfully. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Huang Tsai Ch'ing</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_074.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_076.html">Next</a> </body></html>
