<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Seven</H2><P>Verse 7a:"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." </P><P>The church has been judged. Now the individuals have to hear what the Spirit is saying. The Lord knows that the whole church can no longer be used by God. Hence, He is calling the individuals. The whole has become fallen, but there may still be some individuals who are willing to submit to God. This is the reason that the Lord is calling the individuals. We have to realize that the organized church has already been judged in this age. God has abandoned it already. However, the work of the individuals will be judged in the future. In that day, at the judgment seat, the Lord will no longer judge the church as a whole for that has been condemned already. The individual's work, however, will be searched by the Lord's burning eyes for a reward or a punishment. The Lord says clearly here that unless the church repents, He will remove its lampstand in this age. This is a judgment on the whole and has been executed already because we know that in fact the church did not repent. As to the Lord's promises after this, they are for the individuals at the time of reward and punishment at the resurrection. As such, they are for the future.</P><P>As a whole, if a church has the presence of Christ within, we should follow the teaching of the church (Matt. 18:17). But what should we do if the church has left its first love, intentionally or unintentionally, and has usurped the place of Christ and the Holy Spirit, acting contrary to the teaching of the Bible, adding to it what the Bible never teaches, and shouting loudly for others to follow it? "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." The assertion of the authority of the church is a proposition of Roman Catholicism. In the present age of apostasy, what the saints should hear is not the church but the words of the Holy Spirit, that is, the Bible. The Lord's explicit teaching here is that the system of Romanism, its papal assertion, whether within the Roman Catholic Church, within the Protestant church, or in any other place that has their poisons, should be totally rejected. We should only hear God's word. The Lord is calling individual saints to hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches so that through their understanding of Christ's mind they may be able to measure the condition of the church by His word. In other words, every believer should know the condition of the so-called church around him. But unfortunately, there are few who have an ear, and there are fewer who are willing to hear!</P><P>What the saints should hear is "what the Spirit says to the churches." It is not to the church but to the churches. Therefore, he who has an ear must not only hear what the Lord says to his own church but what He says to all the other churches. This command should not only be heeded by the saints of that day; it should not be neglected by the faithful lovers of the Lord in all ages.</P><P>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." The words are for the churches, but not all the churches will hear because there are many in them who do not have an ear. Hence, although the words are for the churches, only a few who have an ear can hear and keep them. This is why today's principle for a Christian is personal responsibility. In the ancient time, after the Lord had rejected the Israelites in Matthew 12, He spoke in chapter thirteen words that the ones being judged were not able to hear (vv. 13-15), so that the disciples who had ears could hear (v. 9). In the same way, the Lord has now judged the church and is speaking words that they "hear and by no means understand" (v. 14) so that those who have ears can follow Him individually. How solemn this is! The Lord's words are to the spiritual saints; they are not for the fleshly Christians. This is why they are not able to hear (1 Cor. 2:10-11). For this reason those who are able to hear should hear.</P><P>"To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God" (Rev. 2:7b). This word of promise to the overcomers is a sound of music. No matter how difficult is the pathway of the cross, we should not draw back. Though suffering is increasing, it should not make us surrender but should urge us on to victory. God's stars shine equally by day and by night, but darkness makes them shine brighter. Trials and tribulations are not present woes. These darknesses have been with us since the beginning of time. The way of faith has been this way since the beginning. How the coming reward attracts us! It turns our frustration on the homeward journey into a pursuit of the race ahead and intensifies our homesick sentiments! What will supersede the joy of Paradise except the blessed hope?</P><P>He "who overcomes." In the original language the word is in the singular. It refers to individual saints. The faithful individuals who have an ear can overcome. As a sinner need not wait for the whole world to believe in the Lord before he can be saved, a saint does not have to wait for the whole church to repent before he can overcome. An overcomer does not have to wait for a companion; everyone can overcome. In reality, most overcomers are alone. The Lord willing, He may give us some companions, but we must not wait until we have companions before we overcome. Abram did not want to go to Canaan alone. As a result, he was kept in Haran by his father. To wait for a companion is a waste of time. At any rate, the way we take is not void of forerunners' footsteps. At least a pair of feet with nail marks has trodden it before and has left us with clear footprints. Although the general situation of the church is enough to disappoint men, the Lord's calling is still going out to individuals. In spiritual matters there is no such thing as victory through numeric superiority. Although an overcomer has his crisis, he also has his reward. We all would like to have Paul's crown, but we do not want to have Steven's stones. May the Holy Spirit move the readers of these pages to become willing to take this way so that they may obtain their reward. May we know that God has not given the promise to the church that has left the first love. The rebuked and judged church will not be moved by the promises anymore; these are past events already. What she fears and waits for is judgment. It is a blessing that we can still have God's promises.</P>
