   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVINE LIFE MUST BE SATISFIED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I recall a story of two brothers, both Christians, who had a rice paddy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rice paddies need to be irrigated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their paddy was halfway up a hill; others were lower down.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the great heat of the day they drew water and filled their paddy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the evening they went to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But while they were sleeping, the farmer lower down the hill dug a hole in the irrigation channel surrounding the brothers' field and let all the water flow into his field.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The next morning the brothers saw what had happened, but they said nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again they filled the channels with water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The following day they saw that their field had been emptied again, but they still did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were Christians and felt that they should endure in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This happened every day for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people suggested that they stand guard in their field at night to catch the thief and beat him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not say a word in response; they just endured because they were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the human concept, they should have been walking joyfully, happily, and victoriously because they were enduring in silence, even after drawing water daily and having it stolen so many times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But strangely enough, even though they drew water every day and remained silent while others stole it, they did not have peace in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They then went to see a brother with some experience in the Lord's work and said, "We do not understand why we have no peace after enduring for seven or eight days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christians should endure and allow others to steal from them, but we do not have peace in our hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This brother was very experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, "You have not done enough, nor have you endured enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should first fill the field of the person who has stolen your water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you can fill your own field.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Go and try this, then see whether you will have peace within."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They both agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The next day they got up earlier than usual and filled the field of the person who had stolen their water, before filling their own field.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strangely enough, they became more and more joyful as they filled that person's field.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they came to fill their own field, they had peace in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were at peace with the thought of allowing that person to steal their water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After two or three days of doing this, the person who had stolen their water came to apologize, saying, "If this is Christianity, I want to hear about it."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows us that in the realm of right and wrong, enduring is right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What more can we ask one to do?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These ones had spent an entire day drawing water, and not in ordinary weather, but in hot weather.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were not educated people; they were farmers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had done the right and good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What else could one ask of them?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet they had no peace inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This illustrates the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way of right and wrong is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man says that right is good enough, but God says that only life is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must do things to the point that joy and peace are produced inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the difference between the way of life and the way of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems as if right and wrong are sufficient and that nothing else is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God is not satisfied with being right.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He requires us to satisfy the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What does the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5 7 teach us?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It teaches us nothing less than that being right is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must do things in a way which satisfies the life God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the content of Matthew 5 7, the Sermon on the Mount.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Sermon on the Mount does not say that everything is all right as long as things are done according to what is right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man asks why he has to turn the other cheek when someone hits him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is it not good enough if we do not say anything when someone strikes us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is it not wonderful that we have not rebuked him and have shown great restraint?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But God says that it is not even enough to just lower our heads and leave when we are struck.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not satisfy the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must turn our other cheek for that person to strike as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that we have no hate in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not angry and can endure this treatment a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Life is humble.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Life can turn the other cheek for another blow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many people say that Matthew 5 7 is too difficult for them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I admit that it is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is impossible for us to carry out Matthew 5 7.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we try, we will die because we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, we have another life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It tells us that we will not be happy if we do not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It does not matter how much we have been offended by a brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do not kneel down to pray for him or her, we will not have inward joy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is good to endure in silence, but if we do not follow the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, we will not have inward joy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Sermon on the Mount teaches that we must satisfy the life of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In doing these things, the divine life is satisfied, released, at peace, and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the whole matter: Are we walking in the way of life or in the way of right and wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we read God's Word clearly, we will see that it is wrong to decide matters by the principle of right and wrong or to live, act, and have our being according to our self-life.</S>
