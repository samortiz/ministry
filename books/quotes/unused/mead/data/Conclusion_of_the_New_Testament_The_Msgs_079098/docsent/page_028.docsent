   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. Given by the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit has been given by the Son John 3:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit was also given by the Father John 14:16b; Luke 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as there are two senders of the Spirit, there are also two givers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fact that both the Father and the Son have given the Spirit is a strong proof that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 3:34 says that the Son "gives the Spirit not by measure."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the Spirit given by the Son is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "immeasurable" denotes not only the sphere of the Spirit but also the content and nature of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The immeasurable Spirit is immeasurable in sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is immeasurable also in content and nature, that is, in what the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This immeasurable Spirit is actually the consummate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a Spirit has been given by the Son. f.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son as the Last Adam Becoming the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning the giving of the Spirit to the New Testament believers, the Son as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before the incarnation, the Triune God was "raw," unprocessed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through incarnation He was processed to become the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Word, who is God, became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was a process, and in this process He was "baked" to become the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The point here is that whereas the Triune God was raw before incarnation, through incarnation He began to enter into a process.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After nine months in the virgin Mary's womb, the child who was the mighty God Isa 9:6 was born and placed in a manger Luke 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, the magi honored and worshipped Him as the very God Matt 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For thirty years He lived in a carpenter's house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He Himself worked as a carpenter and was called a carpenter Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually He was crucified, being on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was buried and went to Hades, even descending into the lower parts of the earth Eph 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All this was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God was processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The process through which the Triune God passed to become the life-giving Spirit is an economical, not essential, matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Change with God can only be economical; it can never be essential.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Essentially, our God cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From eternity to eternity He remains the same in His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in His economy the Triune God has changed in the sense of being processed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, He who was merely God became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He was merely God, He did not have humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when He changed by becoming a God-man, humanity was added to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean, however, that God changed in His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, He was changed only in His economy, in His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has changed in His economy, but He has never changed in His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although God has changed in His economy, no longer will He change economically.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, He will remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason Hebrews 13:8 says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before "yesterday" Jesus Christ did change economically.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He changed by becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He changed in resurrection by becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But now, after His resurrection, Jesus Christ remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Hebrews 13:8, a verse written after Christ's incarnation and resurrection, the word "yesterday" counts from the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ's "today" is today, and His "forever" includes the coming age and eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, it is a mistake to use this verse as the basis for claiming that the Triune God cannot change economically.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Christ became a man through incarnation, and then He became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now that He is the life-giving Spirit He will remain forever the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, Christ, the Son, became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, the Spirit, who was sent in the Son's name, came as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In resurrection the Son did not simply become absolutely one with the Spirit He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Through Christ's resurrection the coming of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was completed.</S>
