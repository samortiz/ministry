   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we enjoy the Lord as the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There will be a day in the future when the Lord will come back to transfigure our body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This will be the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time He will come forth from us as glory, and we will also enter into glory Phil 3:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we will be with Him in the millennial kingdom, enjoying His joy, His presence, His glory, and His authority for a thousand years Matt 25:21, 23; Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After a thousand years of being beside ourselves, a condition that will be full of glory, we will arrive with the Lord at the ultimate manifestation the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression of the mingling of God and man God living in man and man living out God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the central mystery in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This central mystery is that the Triune God is working Himself into tripartite man so that God and man can be mingled and become one God in man and man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a mystery that cannot be described with human words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We absolutely believe that in that day when we are in the New Jerusalem, we will all be crazy and beside ourselves because we will all be exulting without end.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the millennial kingdom and the New Jerusalem have not come, today in the church life we can have a foretaste of this in miniature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we call on the Lord, speak the Lord, and enjoy the Lord, we become beside ourselves and are filled with the Triune God inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PREACHING THE CENTRAL MYSTERY AS THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, we must speak the truth of the central mystery in the Bible everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should no longer speak the superficial gospel of peace and prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not tell others that if they are suffering, they should believe on Jesus so that they will have peace, or that if their business is bad, they only have to believe in Jesus and pray to Him, and then they will get rich.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is not the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The proper gospel is to tell others that the only God, who is the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit became flesh, died on the cross to accomplish redemption, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He went through incarnation, death, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When man repents and believes into Him, immediately He enters into man to be man s life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is in man as the essential Spirit and upon man as the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way He becomes one spirit with man and man also becomes one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result is that man possesses real joy, satisfaction, and the true meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the high gospel that we should announce everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we preach and speak in this way, the essential Spirit will fill us inwardly, and the economical Spirit will fill us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, we will have the Spirit within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will become one spirit with God and will be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this juncture, the life we live will be a life of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and we will spontaneously live out God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is true spirituality, true holiness, and true overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ultimately this is glory, which will expand to become the kingdom, consummating in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will be the completion of the truth of God s central mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, we truly worship You for clearly revealing to us all these divine mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, You are God, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet You have worked Yourself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, we really praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today You are one with us, and we are also one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, You dwell in our regenerated spirit, daily sanctifying us, renewing us, transforming us, and conforming us to Your image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day You will come out of us in glory, and You will also bring us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a mystery this is!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a glorious economy this is!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lord, bless this word by bringing all the saints into the mysteries of the truth so that we may daily learn this truth, speak this truth, and teach others regarding this central mystery in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen.</S>
