   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE BEING ONLY ONE CHURCH IN A CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is universal, and it is also expressed locally in city after city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of how small or large a city is, there can be only one church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For instance, a church was raised up in a small village in Kansas.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are only about thirty people living in this village, but twelve brothers and sisters were raised up to stand on the ground of locality and meet in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, there are also large cities such as Taipei with a population of about two or three million, New York with about ten million, and Tokyo with more than ten million.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in large cities there should still be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible gives Jerusalem as a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Two thousand years ago Jerusalem was a large city with a population of more than one million.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved, and later another five thousand were saved Acts 2:41; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There were more than ten thousand believers in Jerusalem, but there was only one church, not many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The saints there met from house to house, breaking bread, praying, preaching the gospel, and continuing in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There were thousands who practiced the way of meeting from house to house 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every household was a small meeting, not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know this because Acts 8:1 speaks of the church which was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse uses the singular form of the word church, not the plural form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was only one church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though the saints were scattered in thousands of homes, there was only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church in Taipei is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are at least three hundred and sixty small groups in Taipei, but these groups are not three hundred and sixty churches; they are one church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the saints are gathered in many places, there is only one church with one eldership and one administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE LIFE PULSE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Meetings are crucial to the church as the house of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have many meetings in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The life pulse of the church is in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not going to the meetings is equivalent to cutting off our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a person stops attending the meetings, his church life comes to a halt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This can be compared to a person who is never at home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As far as he is concerned, his home does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the church life is a meeting life, and we should never stop meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to take care of many needs for our human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These needs include food, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should also take care of our marriage and family, including begetting and raising children, and we must take care of education.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With these responsibilities how should we take care of our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At present, we have five kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the ministry meeting, bread-breaking meeting, prayer meeting, small group meeting, and truth meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ministry meeting is to minister the word through the release of messages for the edification of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This meeting is held on Lord s Day morning in the different halls so that the saints can meet in their respective halls.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The young saints should attend this meeting even if they are very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s Day is the first day of the week, and we should set this day aside to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not Abandoning Our Assembling Together</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>but Exhorting One Another</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though the young saints need to sleep less during their final exams, they must enjoy the word that ministers life on the Lord s Day and also break bread to remember the Lord and worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the students must study hard, they do not need to attend the other meetings, such as the prayer meeting and the truth meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, they should do their best to attend a meeting on campus during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will enable them to keep in touch with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They should come together in the small group meetings to set one another on fire, just as a hot piece of coal must be placed beside cold pieces of coal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way to exhort and encourage one another according to Hebrews 10:25: Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that the young people will earnestly practice this.</S>
