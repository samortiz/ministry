	 <h2 class="head2">Prayer Bringing In Watchfulness</h2>
<p>Another thing that needs our attention related to prayer is the matter of being watchful. Prayer brings in watchfulness. The Lord Jesus often put being watchful together with prayer. He said, &ldquo;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation&rdquo; (Matt. 26:41). It is difficult for a person who does not pray to be watchful. I can testify concerning this. The insight I receive concerning the work, including my thorough understanding and my long-term view, comes from prayer. Before I pray, I might have a vague feeling concerning many things, but while I am praying, a sense of alertness comes. This sense is watchfulness. The word <em>watch</em> has the meaning of observing. To watch is to open your eyes. Instead of having our eyes closed in confusion, we observe things thoroughly. To watch does not merely mean to look but also to observe. The most effective observation is done in prayer.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should learn not to speak so many of our own words, because this interrupts the watchfulness and the observing in the spirit. However, if we do not open our mouth to utter anything, our mind will wander. We may be distracted if we pray with our eyes opened, and our mind may wander if we pray with our eyes closed. It is not easy to stop our mind when we pray. We need to learn to be a person of prayer, to have a spirit of prayer, and to give every person we contact and every thing we do to the Lord in prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO REJECT AND DENY THE SELF</h2>
<p>One who serves the Lord should also learn to reject and deny the self. The Chinese Union Version translates the phrase <em>deny himself</em> in Matthew 16:24 as &ldquo;sacrifice the self.&rdquo; To sacrifice the self means to get rid of the self. This translation does not convey the correct meaning, because no matter how hard we try to get rid of the self, the self does not leave us; it is with us all the time. The self is corrupted. The content of the self is the flesh, the old creation, with its passions, lusts, sins, jealousy, strife, and ambition. All of these things are in the flesh. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (v. 24). To take up the cross means to remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death, to not depart from His death, and to allow the Lord&rsquo;s death to operate in us and kill the self. The more we cooperate with the Lord, the easier it is for us to deny the self. We need to learn to deny the self when we fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>We can never fully learn the lesson of denying the self. We need to continue learning this lesson until we are transfigured. As long as we are living, our self and the old creation continue to exist. The longer we live on the earth, the more experienced we may become concerning spiritual things, but our self may also become more experienced. Hence, for the rest of our lives, there is no end to learning the lesson of denying the self. Denying the self is not something that we can learn after hearing a message. We must learn to reject the self and to deny the self all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING BEING INDIVIDUALISTIC</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord we also need to avoid being individualistic. We are members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, and no member can exist alone. Any member that is separated will die, because a member that is detached from the Body is isolated, and this results in death. This lesson is particularly for the young serving ones. As we learn to serve the Lord, we need to exercise to live in the principle of the Body. We should never do anything alone. Instead, two or three saints should coordinate together and learn to fellowship together, checking with one another&rsquo;s feelings. This is not the same as a subordinate requesting permission from his boss. It is the fellowship among members of the Body related to their feelings concerning specific matters. This is a great protection. We can compare this to a military troop that is fighting on the front line. Any soldier who leaves the group is likely to be killed. This is an example of how we need to be careful and realize that whenever we are alone and isolated, Satan will take the opportunity to attack us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING OPINIONS</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord we should not have any opinions. Serving the Lord is a corporate matter that requires the serving ones to come together to fellowship without any opinions. May we all learn to be persons without opinions. You may say that if you are to have no opinion, it is better not to pray or fellowship. This is not a proper attitude. Everyone should speak, but our speaking should be in wisdom, without opinions. We can give an example to show the difference between wisdom and opinion. A person with an ulcer should not eat anything sour, sweet, or fried. This is not an opinion. However, suppose this same person suggests that everyone follow his way of eating. That is an opinion.</p>
