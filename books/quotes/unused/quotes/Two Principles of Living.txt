If man wants to constantly live before God, then he must know what it means to eat the fruit of the tree of life
After becoming Christians, some people live by the principle of right and wrong, while others live by the principle of life
If we would consider a little, we would see that some people live according to the principle of right and wrong or good and evil
If you do not know about it, you will set the principle of life aside and begin to follow the principle of right and wrong
As they carefully consider a certain matter, being Christians, they determine whether it is good and right to do that thing
By taking care to decide whether or not something is good and right, they consider themselves to be good Christians
It is the Old Testament, the law, worldly religions, human morality, and human ethics, but it is not Christianity
Many times something is right and good in the eyes of man, but strangely the inner life has no response and grows cold and retreats
Please remember, God's Word tells us that our Christian living is based on an inner life, not an outward standard of right and wrong
Many worldly people, who are not saved, live according to the best standard of living they can attain: the principle of right and wrong
If the life is strong and active within us, we can do this; if the life is cold and retreating within us, we should not
If we were to do them, we would not be rewarded, and if we were not to do them, there should be no shame, because they are outside of us
Once this matter is resolved, we can see that we must not only avoid all that is evil but also all that is merely good
Many matters are right according to human standards, but the divine standard pronounces them wrong because they lack the divine life
We also may say that it is right, but does the Lord's life rise up within us or does it recede when we begin to do something?
As we are doing that thing, do we have an increasing sense that we are on the right track, or is something telling us that we are off?
It is not a question of whether we are right or wrong but of whether or not the divine life in us agrees with something
Strangely enough, even though they drew water every day and remained silent while others stole it, they did not have peace in their hearts
The next day they got up earlier than usual and filled the field of the person who had stolen their water, before filling their own field
The Sermon on the Mount does not say that everything is all right as long as things are done according to what is right
It is good to endure in silence, but if we do not follow the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, we will not have inward joy
Many times when we go to exhort a brother, he will receive our exhortation with courtesy and promise to do what God says
Brothers and sisters, as we live before God, our actions must not be determined by good and evil, but by the life within
A Christian should not only repent before God for the sins he has committed often he must repent before God for the good things he has done
Paul did not act according to an outward standard of right and wrong, so he could only say, 'I do not even examine myself
We must learn the lesson before God that we should never act merely according to the standard of right and wrong
In every matter when we seek God's speaking within us, spontaneously there will be the shining of inward light
May we see that discerning right from wrong is sin and death, because only those who live in death can do this
