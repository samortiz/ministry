<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRITUAL RESPONSIBILITY<br>OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 8:4-5, 26-27; Eph. 2:5; John 3:3, 5-6; Gal. 2:20</H1><P>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the spiritual responsibility of the elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULFILLING THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD<br>OF THE GOSPEL</H2><P>The spiritual responsibility of the elders is primarily the preaching of the gospel. The New Testament presents this truth in a very deep, hidden, and significant way. In its highest light concerning the gospel, the New Testament shows that the preaching of the glad tidings is the fulfillment of the New Testament priesthood (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). In Romans 15:16 Paul said, "That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit." The noun priest in Greek means a laboring, struggling, energizing priest. We should be the New Testament priests not merely in position or name but in actuality. We should struggle and be very energetic because we know that Satan's goal is to frustrate the spreading of the gospel. In the entire universe and especially on the earth, there is a struggle between God and Satan. God wants to spread His Son, Christ, as the good news, but Satan hates the spread of Christ. Therefore, we are warring against Satan for the cause of the gospel.</P><P>As the New Testament priests of the gospel, we must offer living sacrifices. In the Old Testament, the priests offered sacrifices from the herd, the flock, and the harvest. All the offerings in the Old Testament were types of Christ. In type, the sacrifice offered to God by the Old Testament priests was Christ. Today the offering of the individual Christ has been accomplished. It is now time for the offering of the corporate Christ. As the New Testament priests, we should offer the members of Christ to God.</P>
