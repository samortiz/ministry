Everyone needs to know God&#8217;s eternal plan. If as a young person you are somewhat thoughtful, you do not need to be a great philosopher to eventually ask questions such as, &#8220;What is the meaning of my life in the world?&#8221; and, &#8220;For what purpose was I born?&#8221; If you consider even further, you might also ask, &#8220;Why do the heavens and the earth exist? Why does the universe exist?&#8221; If you give a little thought to these matters, you will discover that the meaning of human life cannot be found in clothing, food, housing, or transportation. You will also conclude that the meaning of the heavens, the earth, and all things cannot be focused merely on human living. These conclusions, however, reveal only what the meaning of the universe and of human life is not. It is difficult to determine a direct answer to the questions concerning the true meaning of the universe and the true meaning of human life.<p>If we want to find the definite answer to these questions, we must look in the holy Scriptures. Today there are millions and millions of books in the world. However, there is only one book-the Bible-that clearly explains the meaning of the universe and the meaning of human life. The Scripture verses listed at the beginning of this message are the answer to these questions. If we would thoroughly get into these verses, we would see the meaning of the universe as well as the meaning of human life. We would see why the universe exists, why human life exists, and why we were born.<p>These few passages from the Scriptures tell us that God has a plan. A purpose is a plan, and a plan is a purpose; however, plan may be a better word than purpose. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is God&#8217;s eternal plan. The word for plan in Greek has the sense of &#8220;beforehand.&#8221; A purpose, design, or plan exists before the actual event occurs.<p>In brief, God&#8217;s eternal plan is that the universe, including the heavens, the earth, and a myriad of items, would be a background or backdrop and that the center of all these things would be man. Man is the center of the universe. God&#8217;s plan is to gain a group of people to be His corporate expression. God desires to have an expression for Himself, and He wants this expression through man. God&#8217;s desire is not to be expressed through angels nor through any other creature but to be expressed through man. Furthermore, He does not want this expression to be through an individual man but through a corporate man. Therefore, God&#8217;s eternal plan is to obtain a corporate man to be His expression in the universe. How will He obtain a corporate man as His expression? He will do so by dispensing His life and nature into this corporate man. Hence, He ordained that this man should have the sonship. God planned beforehand and foreordained that we would receive the sonship, that is, that we would be born of Him and become His sons, having His life and nature.<p>This matter is absolutely unrelated to man&#8217;s fall and his acts of sin. If man had not fallen and sinned, and even if Satan, the devil, did not exist in this universe, God would still desire to carry out this matter. This is because God&#8217;s purpose, God&#8217;s plan, is that the heavens, the earth, and all the myriad of items in the universe would be for the existence of a group of people whom God would regenerate to be His sons and who would have God&#8217;s life and nature. Although God is divine and these people are human, God&#8217;s divine life and nature would enter into them so that they would possess His life and nature. He would be the Father of these people, and they would be His many sons. Thus, they would receive the sonship not for the enjoyment of abundant blessings but for the expression of God.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
