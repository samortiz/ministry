<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
HAVING A BRIGHT FUTURE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING WAY WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE</h2>
<p>The way of serving the Lord full time is the way of the cross; it is a way that leads to death, a way without any future. However, the cross issues in resurrection. Therefore, our future is resurrection. The way we are taking does not end with death; our death issues in a living way. Consequently, it is not a way without a future. This way has a bright future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY CONCERNING CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Based on my experience of following the Lord for more than fifty years, I can testify that the Lord is true and living. I was born into a Christian family. My mother belonged to the Southern Baptist Church. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day we all went with her to the service. Even though I heard the gospel many times, I never was saved. One afternoon in April 1925, out of curiosity I went to hear a lady preacher. At that time I was twenty years old. As I listened to her preach, God came to me, and I was caught by Him. As I was walking home after the meeting, I was called to consecrate myself to the Lord. So I stopped, and looking up into heaven, I said, &ldquo;O God, I want You. Even if the whole world is given to me, I do not want it. From now on I would like to be a poor preacher carrying my Bible and going to all the villages to preach the gospel. If there is nothing to eat, I will eat tree roots and dried sweet potatoes; if there is nothing to drink, I will drink water from the mountain streams.&rdquo; This was how I consecrated myself to the Lord.</p>
<p>After this I began studying at an English college that had been established by some Americans in northern China. I thought that I would go to the villages to preach the Lord Jesus when I graduated. The summer I graduated, I fulfilled my vow to God and went out to village after village preaching the gospel. No pastor encouraged me, and no preacher instructed me to do this. I was just a young person who went out to the villages to preach the gospel. The first gospel tract that I wrote was entitled <em>The Wonderful Way for Souls to Be Saved</em>. In those days printing was not well developed, so I used the old style of typesetting and printed on red paper the characters: <em>The Wonderful Way for Souls to Be Saved</em>. I took my Bible and a bundle of tracts and went from village to village passing out tracts to everyone. I felt that this was enjoyable. I wanted to be a gospel preacher for the rest of my life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPREADING OF THE WORK AND ITS BLESSING</h2>
<p>The Lord accomplished His heart&rsquo;s desire, and soon a local church was raised up in my hometown. Afterward, the Lord opened a door and quickly brought me to Shanghai, which was the largest city in China. Later, during the war against Japan, I was in Chefoo. In those days the churches had a number of saints with outstanding abilities and capabilities, and among the brothers in northeastern China, there were several wealthy brothers. They all loved the Lord and gave financially; thus, the Lord&rsquo;s work spread very quickly.</p>
<p>I told the brothers many times that we needed to use the human resources from northern China and the financial resources from northeastern China to spread into northwestern China. Hence, in March and April of 1943 seventy brothers and sisters migrated out of Chefoo to Inner Mongolia in the northwestern region of China. When they went, they consecrated all they had to the Lord. The church provided them with only their traveling expenses plus three months of living expenses. During their first three months, they had to find a way to make a living. Some taught in elementary schools, and some opened small businesses. All those who migrated were apostles. The following year an elder from the church in Chefoo went to visit the brothers and sisters who had migrated and saw that more than forty churches had been raised up.</p>
<p>Prior to the war, Western missionaries had sowed the seed of the gospel and shepherded some believers. During the war, the Western missionaries were held in custody by the Japanese in concentration camps, and the believers in the denominations that they had raised up were like sheep without a shepherd. When these seventy ordinary saints arrived, they did not bring only the gospel; they also brought the truth. They taught the truth and brought the wandering believers onto the way of the truth. Therefore, more than forty groups turned to take the way of the church. The seventy brothers and sisters migrated in March and April of 1943, and by wintertime they had raised up many churches.</p>
<p>In addition to the seventy saints who went to Inner Mongolia in the northwest of China, another thirty brothers and sisters went to the Yalu River region in the northeast. Later, we lost contact with them because of the changes in the political situation, and we do not know what happened to them. Hence, one hundred saints migrated in 1943; seventy of them went to the northwest and thirty to the northeast. This testimony shows that even when it may seem as though we are taking a way that leads to death, a way of termination, in resurrection the Lord opens for us a living way, a way with a bright future.</p>
