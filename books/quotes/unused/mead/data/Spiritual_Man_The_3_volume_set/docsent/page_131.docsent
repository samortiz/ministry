   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The spiritual man's body is also subject to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It does not, by its lusts, draw the soul to commit sins as it once did.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now it is cleansed by the precious blood, its lusts were dealt with by the cross, and it is entirely a servant of the soul which takes orders from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It responds quickly to complete authority to control it by the renewed will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It no longer oppresses the weak spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit of the spiritual man has been strengthened, and the body is under its power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle mentioned the actual condition of a spiritual man in 1 Thessalonians 5:23: "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse speaks of a spiritual man as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 He has God dwelling in his spirit to sanctify him wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life of the spirit, poured into his whole being, causes every faculty to live by the life of the spirit and walk by the power of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 He does not live by the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His mind, imagination, feeling, ideals, love, and opinion have all been renewed and cleansed by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are completely under the rule of the spirit and no longer act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3 Although he still has a body and is not a disembodied spirit, the tiredness, pain, and other demands of the body have absolutely no influence on the spirit to cause it to lose its ascended position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the members of the body are instruments of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, a spiritual man is a man who belongs to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His whole person is ruled by the spirit, and all the faculties of his person are completely under the spirit and regulated by it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His spirit is the characteristic of his life; everything comes from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has absolute dependence: what he says and what he does are not freely done by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He always denies his own strength and draws strength from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A spiritual man is a man who lives by the spirit.</S>
