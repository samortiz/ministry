   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While it is true that the burdens we have are from God and that our burden is God's will, it is also true that our knowledge mainly governs our burdens initially.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For instance, God may call certain things to our remembrance and may ask us to pray for them, or in the middle of the night God may call us to get up and pray for a brother in a remote place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These experiences do occur, but they are not common, and God does not do this kind of thing very often.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes God cannot find anyone nearby, and He has to go to someone far away; however, these are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Under ordinary circumstances, God directs men according to their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we say that knowledge governs a burden in its initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, after one has knowledge, it does not necessarily mean that he will have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may know about the condition and everything else related to certain brothers and sisters yet not have any feeling for them or be stirred up within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the knowledge, but we do not have the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, burden does not come ultimately from knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet knowledge does govern our burden in its initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, God may give you knowledge of certain matters and the burden to pray and help out the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way, the burden comes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A burden can be formed at the beginning through knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most burdens even have knowledge as their starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is rare for God to start a burden without giving any knowledge of it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes God may give you a burden to pray for a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may be sick or he may be in difficulty, but you know nothing about it; you have not received any news from him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet God puts a clear burden within you to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps after a few weeks or a few months, you may receive a letter from him and find that he was indeed sick and in difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are cases like this, but they are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may happen once in a thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Generally, burdens start from knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet this does not mean that knowledge is burden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since prayer is a Christian ministry and an important ministry, a question arises: When there is a heavy burden to pray, do we express it through words, or should we be quiet and silent?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Can we just bear our burdens silently before God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We believe that if God gives us a prayer burden, then He wants it to be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have only a few disjointed words, we should express ourselves with these words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Burdens are released only through utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we remain silent before God, the burden will not leave; rather, it will become heavier and heavier upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, in the spiritual realm, it is an amazing principle that utterance counts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God takes account not only of what we believe but also of what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is mindful not only of the intents of our heart but also of the words in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our Lord said to the Canaanite woman, "Because of this word, go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The demon has gone out of your daughter" Mark 7:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The few words the woman uttered caused the Lord to work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may make a request in our hearts, but there is more effect in an uttered request.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God seems to require that we speak what is in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was a crucial prayer, but it was a prayer with "strong crying" Heb 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not insist on loud prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes there is no need to pray in a loud way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if there is a heavy burden within, there should be a correspondence between the inner burden and the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the burden within is not strong, loud prayers are nothing but noise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if the burden within is heavy, it must be uttered with audible sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we cannot pray aloud in our homes, let us find a place where we can utter our burden as the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At times He went to a deserted place Mark 1:35 and at other times He went to the mountain Luke 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if we cannot go to the wilderness or the mountain, we should pray audibly even if it means praying in a low voice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The important thing is that our prayers have to be audible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our burden is strong enough, we can find a suitable place to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God wants our burdens to be articulated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have not articulated our burden, the burden will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some say that they pray silently and that it matters little whether or not the burden is released.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man has not finished the work he has in his hands, he cannot go on to more work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the same way, if our burden is not released, God cannot give us another burden.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to discharge our burden with our words so that God can give us a fresh burden.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But very often our difficulty is that even when we are conscious of a burden to pray, we do not know how to pray when we kneel down.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We know that something is weighing within us, but we do not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is a burden in our spirit, but we do not know what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to realize that our burden is a matter of the spirit, whereas our comprehension of the burden is a matter of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When our spirit touches our mind, we will understand the nature of the burden in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the spirit and the mind touch, both will become clear.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some people feel that they have a burden but do not know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is because their spirit has not yet touched their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, when their spirit has a burden, their mind does not comprehend the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How can contact between the spirit and the mind be established?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you want to find anything, how should you go about it?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If it is to the west and you go east, how would you find it?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You would have to circle the globe before you found it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The object may be only a mile away, but you would have walked around the globe before you found it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You should take the point where you are as the center and look around in a circle, moving out steadily from the center to the circumference, expanding the circle as you move.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way, you can cover all four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the best way to look for things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When your spirit has lost touch with your mind, you should do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When you kneel down to pray, do not hold on tenaciously to one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>That would be like walking in one direction, and you will not find what you are looking for easily.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Pray for many things and from many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After praying a few sentences for one thing, you may feel that it is not the right thing to pray about.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You should drop it and change to another subject.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You may have to change your subject two, three, or four times.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Or you may become clear after you come to the second subject.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You may also have to mention five or six things before you feel that you have touched something that releases your burden; once you pray for this, your mind and your spirit become linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You should then pray specifically for that matter in order to release your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once you pray this way, you will feel released, and when you have released your first burden, you will be ready to receive a second burden from God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Many Christians cannot be used by God in the prayer ministry because they are over-burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They have never released any of their burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God gives them a burden to pray, and they may know what it is; their mind and their spirit may be connected, yet they do not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Instead, they allow the burden to become heavier and heavier until they are so crushed that they cannot bear it any longer; the feeling for the burden will be gone, and they can no longer pray.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Oh, brothers and sisters, the work of God will be seriously hampered if we do not have a free spirit to serve as instruments for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we asked someone to help us with a certain job but found that his hands were full, it would be useless to seek his aid.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the same way, if we are weighed down by many burdens, how can God commit anything further to us?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is why we must release our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The release of the burden will set us free, and God will be free to give us additional burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Without this, we will not be able to fulfill a ministry of prayer before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The ministry of prayer requires a liberated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we have a burden in our spirit and do not pray for it, we cannot go on to a second thing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we have a burden but are not faithful to pray and take up the ministry of prayer before the Lord, we will feel heavy the first day, heavier the second day, and still heavier the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After a few more days, the burden will gradually go away, and the strength to pray will be gone as well.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we have a burden and do not pray, eventually it will cost us our prayer ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must, therefore, devote time to fulfill our ministry of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The best way to pray is to pray with two or more people; this will save us from being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Many people have not learned to pray together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In praying with others, we must not only pray with our mouths but listen with our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we learn to pray in this way, the "spiral" prayer that we mentioned earlier, praying from the center to the circumference, will come into effect.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Through prayer, we can release the burden that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Prayer frees our spirit and liberates our being.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This will allow God to commit fresh burdens to us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Today God needs the cooperation of His church on the earth, and we can cooperate with Him through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>May there be a way for the working out of His will!</S>
