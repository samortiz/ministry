   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, the Roman Catholic Church believes in the absolute power of the priest to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It bases its teaching on John 20:23: "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It believes that the power of forgiveness of sins was first committed to the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fact is that only ten apostles were present when the Lord spoke these words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's appearing in John 20:22-23 and His appearing in Luke 24 are the same incident.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 24:13 says, "And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia away from Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 33 then says that these ones went to the others and those who were assembled together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While they were relating these things, the Lord appeared to them and said, "Peace to you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of John goes on to say that the Lord breathed upon them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He said, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained" 20:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the Lord gave the disciples authority to forgive men, but He gave them the authority not to carry it out in themselves, but in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Roman Catholic Church however, assigns the priests to carry out this work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the priests say that a certain person is forgiven of his sins, his sins are supposed to have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church pays no attention to whether or not the priests are in fact in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The main point of the Lord's word is that those who execute forgiveness must be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They must have the power of the Holy Spirit and the manifestation of life within them before they have the authority to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This forgiveness is a kind of indirect forgiveness; it can only be carried out in the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of John says that the Lord forgives whom we forgive and retains the sins of those whom we retain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the Acts of the Apostles, we do not see such power of forgiveness executed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Had the Lord entrusted such authority to the church, every apostle would have had the power to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's word shows us that the church is merely a vessel, through which the Lord forgives men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a man genuinely repents and confesses his sins, we baptize him and declare that his sins are forgiven in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a declaration of a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a man confesses his sins, the Lord forgives his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the one who is forgiven may not know that he is forgiven because he has been a heathen all his life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we have to declare the fact of his forgiveness to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No man can forgive another man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one on earth has the authority to forgive sins except the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one on this earth can forgive another person's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CONCERNING INDULGENCES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the sixteenth century the Catholic Church wanted to build the great St. Peter's Cathedral, but it did not have enough money.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Pope Leo X introduced the selling of indulgences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He declared that when a man bought an indulgence, he would be spared from punishment, even though he might have been sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, twelve indulgences would absolve the sin of murder or four indulgences would absolve the sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Martin Luther was one of the fiercest attackers of the Catholic indulgence system.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He pointed out strongly that it is heresy to try to avert punishment with indulgences.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CONCERNING MASS A Perverted Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The mass is the centerpiece of all Catholic heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the most serious heresy of all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No lover of the Lord can tolerate this heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Catholic mass is equivalent to the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible shows us by clear example that we have the bread and the cup in breaking the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Catholic mass, the element received by common believers contains only the bread, not the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Catholics insist that during the mass, the bread is no longer bread but is changed into the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Roman Catholics say that every time they conduct the mass, they offer a fresh sacrifice of Calvary for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Pope Pius IV proclaimed in his decretal: "I confess that in the mass, a real, proper, and propitiating sacrifice is offered to God for the living and the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I acknowledge that in the most holy sacrament of the holy communion, our Lord Jesus Christ's real, true, and physical body and blood are present, together with His soul and His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The bread is fully and actually transformed into His body, and the wine is fully and actually transformed into His blood."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Catholic Church calls this the doctrine of transubstantiation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It also says that as long as one accepts one of the two elements the bread or the wine he has received the complete undiluted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What a heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The thirteenth session of the Council of Trent anathematized anyone who considers the bread of the communion a mere symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if one considers only a small part of the elements as mere bread and wine, he is anathematized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Roman Catholic Church says that even though the mouth partakes of a little piece, it is the complete whole because it embodies the complete whole.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That little piece is the body and blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It says that these sanctified elements are to be revered and should be regarded as the very holy Son of God, and they should be praised.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Catholic Church believes that the bread is the very incarnation of His flesh.</S>
