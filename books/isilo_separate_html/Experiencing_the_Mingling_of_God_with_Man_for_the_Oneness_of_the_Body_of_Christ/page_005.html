<p>We must also see the oneness of the increase of Christ. All the grains must be one, all the branches must be one in the one vine, and all the brothers must be one. This is why the Lord prayed in John 17:21-23, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage shows us the basis for our oneness. Verse 21 shows us that Christ is in the Father, the Father is in Christ, and we are one by being in Christ. Verse 22 mentions the glory that the Lord has given to us. This glory is simply the divine life, which the Father gave to the Son and the Son gave to us so that we might be one. We can be one only in the divine life. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;I in them,&rdquo; indicating that Christ is in us. It is because Christ is in us that we can be perfected into one. Thus, we are in Christ, we have the divine life, and Christ is in us. These are the most important aspects of the basis for our oneness. It is possible for us to be one with others because we are in Christ, we have the divine life, and Christ is in us.</p>
<p>We must realize that we have been put into Christ and are in Christ as our sphere in which we walk, live, and work (1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 2:6). We must remember that day by day we are walking, living, and working in Christ, who is our realm and our everything. In this sphere we are supplied and also limited by Him. The Lord is our pattern; while He was on the earth He always realized that He was in the Father, and He never acted outside of the Father (John 14:10; 5:17, 19). All His activities in His daily life were limited by the Father. Now we are in Him, just as He was in the Father. Thus, we must act, walk, work, and live in Christ, who is our limitation, our sphere, and our everything. When we are outside of Christ, we are outside of the oneness of the Body. When we act apart from Christ, we are detached from the Body of Christ. We must learn the lesson of constantly walking in Christ. This is even related to the matter of the church, which is the increase and counterpart of Christ. We cannot be in the church in actuality apart from Christ. We must walk, live, and work in Christ in order to have the real church life.</p>
<p>Not only are we in Christ, but we also have the same divine life, the one life, which is Christ Himself and also God Himself. We must realize that we have God in Christ as our life, and we must learn to live by this life day by day. This is not a mere doctrine; this is something that is crucial to the church life. If we are going to be the full expression of Christ as the Body of Christ, we must realize that we have the divine life and that we are one in this life. Outside of this life we are many separate individuals, but because we are in this life, we are one.</p>
<p>The final crucial point is that Christ is in us (14:20; 2 Cor 13:5). Without Christ being in us and Christ living in us, we cannot be perfected. An empty cup is imperfect because there is no water within it. Similarly, we are imperfect without Christ living in us. Just as a cup must be filled with water to be perfect, we as vessels of Christ must be filled with Christ in order to be perfected. When we are filled with Christ, we will be one. On the one hand, we will be in Christ as our spiritual realm, and on the other hand, Christ will be in us as our spiritual fullness.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a brother who does everything by himself and within whom Christ has no ground. Such a person will eventually have a sense of emptiness and of being short of something. He will also sense that it is impossible for him to be joined to the other saints. However, one day he may go through a crisis. As a result, he may offer himself to the Lord, take Christ as his life, and truly begin to practice living by Christ. Gradually, day by day, he will be filled with Christ and perfected by Christ. Eventually, he will spontaneously be joined to the other saints.</p>
<p>Our oneness is based on the facts that we are in Christ, that we have the divine life, and that Christ is in us. In our daily living and in all the situations that we encounter, we must take Christ as our life and remember that we are in Christ. If we give the ground in us to Christ so that He may live in us, we will spontaneously have the oneness. We will have Christ as our life, Christ will have the increase among us, and this increase will be realized in the oneness. Through this oneness, the world will know that Christ is the sent One, and Christ will be glorified, magnified, and received by many others (John 17:21, 23). This is the eternal purpose of God.</p>
<p>God is in Christ, and Christ is in us to be our life. If we constantly take Him as our life, apply Him to all the matters in our daily living, and walk, work, and live in Him and let Him live in us to be our perfection, we will be one as the increase of Christ. This will be the testimony of the Body of Christ and the testimony that Christ is the sent One of God. Christ will be glorified and magnified before the world, and as a result, many people will see Him and believe into Him as their Savior. May the Lord be gracious to us that we would practice to apply Christ as our life in our daily living and realize that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us so that we may be one.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
