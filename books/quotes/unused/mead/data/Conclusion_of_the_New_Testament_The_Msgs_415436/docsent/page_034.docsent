   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 19:16 goes on to say, He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The King of kings refers to His authority, and the Lord of lords refers to His headship.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is higher than all the presidents on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There have been many great men throughout the ages, but all of them died, and few are remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the Lord Jesus Christ is different.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more people oppose Him, the more transcendent He is and the more people believe in Him; the more people oppress Him, the more He multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we read history carefully, we will see that the clever kings would not persecute the Christians, because they knew that whoever persecutes the Christians would never have a good end. Hitler, who was the worst persecutor of God s people in modern times, had a very pitiful end, dying without a proper place for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>History also tells us that governments that persecuted Jesus Christ have fallen quickly.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Roman Caesars, Napoleon, and Hitler were not the Lord; only Jesus Christ is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A day is coming when Christ as the King of kings and the Lord of lords will appear to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fact that Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords will no longer be hidden or mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This name will be written upon His garment and upon His thigh; hence, it will be openly revealed and known by all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will fight for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The garment signifies Christ s attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies Christ s standing strength, His stability.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The war mentioned in Revelation 19:19 is an actual physical war, not a spiritual one; it is a war between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Specifically, Christ as the Son of Man, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords with His followers, who are human beings, will fight against Antichrist, also a human being, and the kings of the earth and their armies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Antichrist will fight against Christ directly and personally.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These two were cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first group to go into the lake of fire, the universal trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two had already died but were raised again, not by God but by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now they will be the first to go directly into the lake of fire, without passing through further death or resurrection like all the others who perish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>i.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Rest Being Killed with the Sword</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Which Proceeds out of His Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 19:21 continues, The rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the result of the war at Armageddon, Christ will defeat Antichrist, who, with the false prophet, will be cast alive into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the rest of Antichrist s armies will be killed with the sword that proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the King of kings and Lord of lords v. 16 . This verse again indicates that the Lord will fight simply by His word, which will be a weapon to kill His enemies.</S>
