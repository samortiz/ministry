<P>Now let us come to James 2:</P><P>Verse 14 says, "What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?" What was James's intention in writing these words? Who was he speaking to? He wrote these words because some were saying that they had faith but not works. If he did not stop these people, the church would have been greatly affected. Faith must be kept before God and not vainly boasted of before man. Faith must be accompanied by works. If anyone says he has faith and does not have works, that kind of faith cannot save him. The word save in the Scripture has several meanings. For example, Paul said, "For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (Phil. 1:19). Was not Paul saved? "Salvation" in this verse does not refer to receiving eternal life by those who believe, but rather to Paul's release from prison. In 2 Corinthians 1:10 Paul said, "Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us." Some think that this refers (1) to the Lord's death on the cross which delivered us from the punishment of our sins in the past, (2) to Christ in heaven as our Mediator delivering us from the authority of sin in the present, and (3) to His coming back again in the future to save our body. This is not what Paul meant. The salvation spoken of here refers to the Lord's delivering the body from affliction. By reading the context, it is clear that affliction came to Paul's company while they were in Asia. They were excessively burdened that they despaired even of living. Yet the Lord delivered them out of this situation. Paul believed that the Lord would deliver them out of their present and future affliction. James's reference to the word save means to profit others in their environment. This is made clear by the following verses.</P><P>James 2:15 and 16 say, "If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food, and any one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?" The "one" in these verses is one who vainly said that he had faith, yet he was not supplying food and clothing to the needy brothers and sisters. He vainly said to them, "Go in peace." Being saved in these verses is not a matter of going to heaven in the future, but a matter of being physically warmed and fed in this age. James implied that it is not adequate just to talk and believe without also meeting the needs of the saints.</P><P>Verse 17 says, "So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself." This is James's conclusion. He meant that if you believe that the brothers and sisters will be warmed and fed but do not give them the things they need, this kind of faith without works is not a living faith but dead. A living faith is believing in the heart that the loving God will not allow the brothers and sisters to be lacking in food or clothing and, at the same time, being enabled by this faith to supply the things they need.</P><P>Verse 18 says, "But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works." There is always someone to refute those who vainly say that they have faith. They will ask, "If you say that you have faith, how is your faith manifested? You only say this with your mouth. But when you encounter difficulties, you are not even willing to sacrifice a single hair for the sake of others. Where is your faith? You pretend to others that you believe, but you have no faith. If you have faith, why do you not give all that you have to the needy saints? They are naked with no clothes to wear, and they lack in daily food and drink. They do not even have anything to eat today. At least you still have clothing to wear and food to eat. Why do you not give all that you have to them? You say that you have faith, but what will you do to show us that you have faith? Your faith is only vain talking. Your faith is dead and not profitable to the needy ones at all. But I have works. My faith is proved by giving the brothers and sisters the things that are needful to them. I believe that God will not let us be short in food and clothing. And since the brothers and sisters are in need, I give all that I have to them. My works are according to my faith. My works are the evidence of my faith. I will show you my faith by my works. Even though you said that you have faith, where is the evidence of your faith? What are you going to do to show us your faith?"</P><P>Verse 19 says, "You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder." The people of Israel believe there is one God and rightly so, but the devil also believes that there is one God, and yet he still remains a devil. James indicates that faith without works is like the devil who, even though he believes in God, is still the devil.</P><P>Verse 20 says, "But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?" Vain man is another name for those who vainly say they have faith. We can say that this kind of man actually has no faith. Those that supply others in a practical way can show their faith to others by their works. Thus, there is first faith, then works. Genuine faith must be accompanied by genuine works. The one who vainly says that he has faith, yet has no works, shows that his faith is dead. His heart before God is not proper, so his faith is dead.</P>
