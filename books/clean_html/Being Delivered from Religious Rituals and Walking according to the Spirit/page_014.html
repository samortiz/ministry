<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE NEW GARMENT</h2>
<p>Before our salvation we looked like ragged beggars and could not possibly match our Bridegroom. We thank the Lord that He is not only the Bridegroom for our enjoyment but also the new cloth to be made into our new garment for us so that we are worthy to enjoy His presence. In Matthew 9:16 the Lord spoke of Himself as unfulled cloth. The Greek word for <em>unfulled</em> also means &ldquo;new.&rdquo; In Luke 5:36 the Lord spoke of Himself as the new garment. Do we know the difference between the new cloth and the new garment? The new cloth is material that is untreated, uncut, and unwashed, and it has not yet been made into a garment. A new garment is made from new cloth that has been treated, cut, washed, sewn, and steamed. From the time of His incarnation until His death on the cross, the Lord was the new cloth. Through His death and resurrection, this new cloth became a new garment. We can put on this new garment simply by saying, &ldquo;O Lord! I believe in You. You died and were resurrected for me.&rdquo; This new garment is our garment of righteousness for us to be justified by God and for us to be able to stand before Him (15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30). This is the way that we are saved by grace to be His match.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE NEW WINE</h2>
<p>In Matthew 9:17 the Lord spoke of the new wine. We have put on the new garment and can match our Bridegroom, but what about our inward condition? How can there be any enjoyment if we are still hungry and thirsty? Hence, merely wearing the new garment is not adequate. We also need to have the new wine within us so that we may have true enjoyment. The new garment can be put upon us, but it cannot be mingled with us to become our life. When we drink the new wine, it enters into us to become our life. The Lord is not only the new garment upon us but also the new wine within us. He not only justifies us outwardly in our position by becoming the garment of righteousness upon us, but He also causes us to drink the new wine of His life. The moment this wine enters into us, we become vigorous and energetic. Those who are drunk with physical wine bring harm to their bodies, but we are energized and invigorated when we drink the Lord Jesus as the new wine. On the day of Pentecost the Jews said that the disciples were &ldquo;full of new wine&rdquo; (Acts 2:13). As Christians, we should also be persons drunk with Christ as the new wine.</p>
<p>Many saints in the church in Los Angeles are drunk with this new wine. From morning until evening they are always proclaiming, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Jesus is Lord! Christ is Victor!&rdquo; There is a brother who is not yet forty years old. He is truly drunk with Jesus, the new wine, and every day he is beside himself. One day this brother was driving his car and calling, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; A policeman thought the brother was drunk and stopped him. Our brother told the policeman that he was not drunk, but he was declaring that Jesus is Lord. A few days later this brother was calling on the Lord, and the same policeman saw him. The policeman could do nothing but agree that Jesus is Lord.</p>
<p>There are seven brothers who live near the meeting hall of the church in Los Angeles. Every day these brothers drive to and from work together. This gives them a good opportunity to enjoy the Lord, especially on their way home from work. When the traffic lights turn red, all the cars stop, and the seven brothers proclaim, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; They are truly beside themselves.</p>
<p>This kind of atmosphere not only releases Christians but also releases the spirit of the gospel, which draws people to follow the Lord. This is much better than being in a dead religion, participating in a dead Sunday service, or attending a dead meeting. It would be wonderful for some of the saints to be beside themselves just as the saints in Los Angeles are. We need to drink the Lord Jesus as the new wine. The more we drink, the better we will be. We need to be drunk and full of the new wine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCHES BEING THE NEW WINESKIN</h2>
<p>Not only do we have the new wine, but we also have the new wineskin (Matt. 9:17). The new wineskin is the local churches. Anything religious is an old wineskin. If we put new wine in old wineskins, the wineskins will burst. New wine must be put in new wineskins. The local churches are the new wineskins that can hold the new wine. In the local churches we can enjoy the new wine.</p>
<p>Some saints may prefer to stay at home and enjoy the Lord instead of going to the meetings. They can stay at home and enjoy the Lord, but after a few days their enjoyment will disappear, because the new wine is depleted. We must go to the meetings of the church, because the local churches are the new wineskins that store the new wine. Hallelujah! We have the Bridegroom, and we have the new cloth to clothe us as the new garment so that we may match our Bridegroom. Furthermore, we have the new wine to drink and the new wineskin to contain the new wine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR CATEGORIES OF CHRISTIANS</h2>
<p>According to our observation, those who profess to be Christians may be divided into four categories. The first category consists of those who take Christ as the new cloth. The second category consists of genuine Christians who take Christ as the new garment. The third category consists of genuine Christians who not only put on the new garment but also drink Christ as the new wine. The last category is the highest. The Christians in this category not only have put on the new garment and drink the new wine but also have the new wine in the new wineskin. The first category of people who profess to be Christians regard Christ merely as a model. They acknowledge that Christ&rsquo;s noble character has made Him a perfect example for humanity, and they imitate Him to serve society. However, they do not accept the vicarious death of Christ or His redemption of their sins, nor do they believe that Jesus was resurrected. This is to take Christ as the new cloth. These are Christians in name only, the so-called modernists.</p>
<p>Genuine Christians receive Christ as their new garment by acknowledging that the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected. They accept that the new cloth passed through the process of cutting and sewing to become the new garment. Those who receive the crucified and resurrected Christ as the new garment are saved and justified. This is very good, but it is still not good enough. Some Christians take a step further. They not only receive the Lord Jesus as their Redeemer but also as their life. They not only put on the new garment but also have the new wine within them.</p>
<p>However, we are not only clothed with the new garment and drinking the new wine, but we are also in the local churches. We have the new wineskin to contain the new wine. We are justified, and we have Christ as our life and the church as our living. Furthermore, we can enjoy Christ as our Bridegroom. Hallelujah! He is the Bridegroom, He is the new cloth for the new garment, He is the new wine, and, as the church, He is even the new wineskin.</p>
