   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Nourish Through Shepherding</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After your friends receive the Lord, you must continue to pray for them and shepherd them into life, so that they may be established in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is usually more effective one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You need to teach them how to pray and to pray-read the Word by doing it with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You also need to help them to read the Word everyday.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fellowship with them about what they read daily, so that they will continue to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Another crucial matter is to help them live by the sense of the spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we think, speak, or do things that are not of the Lord, we get the sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sadness, emptiness, and uneasiness, are examples of this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Conversely, when we have the sense of life we experience joy, peace, rest, etc. Rom 8:6, 13 . When we live by this sense, we are living by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Praying, reading the Word, and living by the spirit are the three foundation stones of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must help your new believing friends to pray, to read the Word, and to live by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>E. Teach in Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 28:20 the Lord said that after we baptized people, we should teach them "to observe all things, whatever I commanded you.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Acts 20:27 the apostle Paul said that he "did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God.''</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, you must teach the new ones everything you know about the Lord, His economy, His recovery, His church, etc. The best way to teach the truth is in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you have a small group of saints meeting together, there are more riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a new one asks a question that you cannot adequately answer, others may be better prepared to answer accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is an example of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>F. Build Through Prophesying</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The last point concerning our practice of the priesthood concerns prophesying in the church meetings to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prophesying, in 1 Corinthian 14, mainly refers to speaking for and speaking forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After having been revived for six days by praying and reading the Lord's Word, and having gone forth to bear fruit, we should have much to speak on the Lord's day to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On Saturday, you can compose a prophesy with the week's enlightenment and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the meetings, we practice as royal priests to speak for God and to speak God into all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may say that you are young and do not know much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever you currently know and have enjoyed is your portion to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not prophesy, the saints will miss the portion that you have received from the Lord that week, and the building up of the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only should you prophesy, you should also train your new ones to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church will be built step-by-step as you and your new ones prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should endeavor to be the holy, royal, and gospel priests in the one priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are faithful, the life and number in the church will increase and the Lord will build His church through us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not say that you are young, and then wait until you are older to get serious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now is the time for you to start to function as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You will learn, and become experienced, mature, and perfected functioning priests as you are growing up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He comes, you will have a great reward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Questions With the teacher and the other students in your class, draw a picture of the tabernacle including all the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Discuss the significance of the tabernacle and its furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Discuss the function, similarities and differences of each aspect of the priesthood holy, royal, and gospel .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In detail, describe the type of living needed to be a proper priest.</S>
