My heart was filled with sadness to learn that Brother Luan was so physically weak. Praise God that His children are always in His hands. The Lord always has a good intention for them. I praise Him for allowing me to learn a little of your situation. May the Lord greatly support you. I give you 1 Peter 5:6-7, and 9-10 and pray for you unceasingly in my heart. I went to England in August and stayed with Miss Fischbacher for six weeks. I attended a ten-day conference on spiritual growth there. The condition of the meeting was very good. We stayed in the country for another four weeks, praying in private and often mentioning your name. I wanted to write once, but I did not get around to it. I praise God for charging me with the work of prayer. I really want to speak with you face to face. These days Luke 21:28 has been a comfort to my heart! May the Lord bless all of you greatly. Greet each of the brothers and sisters for me.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Sun Wen-hwa<br />October 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from<br />Brother Witness Lee</h2><p>Brother Watchman, peace in the Lord:</p><p>It was a big loss that I could not meet you and all the co-workers at Hankow and receive your teachings. I hope to read in The Open Door about the light the Lord has given you. I have been studying the Hebrew language with the brothers and sisters here for the past four weeks. We finished last Friday. I had originally planned to visit the region around Dong-Shiang this week, but I felt later that I should still finish some of the articles for The Christian. I also felt that I should have some fellowship with the brothers and sisters, so I postponed my departure to the countryside. A letter from Peking invited me to go there with my family, but I felt that, for the present, I should do something in Jiao-Dong. Brother Chang, who was first in Chefoo and then in Tsingtao, is now clear about his calling. Although outwardly this brother does not appear to be able to do anything, his life before the Lord and his heart for the Lord are excellent. However, only that which passes through the test counts. He has a burden for the countryside around Jiao-Dong. A few days ago he was here in Chefoo. He will probably go with me into the countryside this time. May the Lord lead and bless! Another brother, Chang Tien-ren, is working in Yi County. This brother studied in the Yingkow Seminary and knew Brother Hwa Tien-min and the others as classmates. The brothers in Chefoo baptized him last summer. When I came to Chefoo this spring, he also came to stay in Chefoo. He came again to Chefoo a few days ago, and I got to know him better. Perhaps the Lord has His leading in this matter. Please pray for this. Brother Bi-Chen is now in his home town in Ping Yin County; Sister Sung is also in her home town. This region still has a need for workers. May the Lord remember this! I praise the Lord for His presence! Please greet Brothers Luan and Lan for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />December 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
