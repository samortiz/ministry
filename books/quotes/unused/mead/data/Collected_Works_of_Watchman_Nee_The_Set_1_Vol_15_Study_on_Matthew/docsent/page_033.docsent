   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 30:"But even the hairs of your head are all numbered."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning us, nothing is too small for Him to care for.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The number of our hairs recorded in heaven is the same as the actual number of hairs we have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A widow once moved into a small upper room.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She asked God for a carpet that was the size of her room.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, someone gave her a carpet together with frying pans and skewers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She confessed that she had forgotten to pray for the last two things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet God had not forgotten them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the principle of God's counting our hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 31:"Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we see that even in the smallest things God is not vague about what He wants to do with His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once a couple was crossing the sea together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The wife was frightened, but the husband watched the storm with calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His attitude so agitated her that she scolded him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The husband therefore took a knife and gestured to kill her, but the wife was not at all alarmed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The husband asked why she was not afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The wife answered that it was because the knife was in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The husband then explained to the wife that he was not afraid of the storm because he knew that the storm was in the hand of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verses 32-33:"Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens; but whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we should witness and go forth to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mistake of the believers today is that the more people oppose, the less they dare to witness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When should the lamp be lit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Does it not shine in the darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Should the lamp rest because the darkness is too great?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the use of the lamp after the day breaks?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God wants us to confess with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Surely our conduct also is important.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the attempt to substitute our conduct for witnessing with our mouth is not a doctrine from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a Christian is excluded from the kingdom, it is his own doing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 34:"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word for sword has the same meaning as that in Luke 2:35, which says, "a sword will pierce through your own soul," referring in particular to the emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Peace" here means reconciliation, security, harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since men are not reconciled to God, they are not reconciled to God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's coming causes every believer to suffer the pain of "a sword."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 35:"For I have come to set men at variance: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here is a requirement of love which is greater than loving our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us that while we live on this earth we cannot keep peace with those who oppose Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we can, it must be that we have some problem with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 36:"And a man's enemies will be those of his household."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason here is that the Lord is their enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the issue of their jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A man cannot love two persons at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he does, the loved ones will become jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our loving the Lord makes others jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 37:"He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord requires us to give Him all; if we give just a little less than all, it will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not a relative love but an absolute love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our loving the Lord has to be to the extent that it causes us pain; only this kind of love will make us joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we love the Lord yet do not have joy, we have not loved the Lord to the extent of giving us pain.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are bearing the cross, that is exactly the time that we can sing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a line of a hymn that says, "I am captivated by the goal."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are so satisfied with what we obtain from men, we cannot see the preciousness of what the Lord gives.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are too close to men, we cannot sense the preciousness of the Lord's closeness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word "worthy" should first be applied to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is the Lord worthy of our love?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is altogether a matter of whether or not the Lord is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not how much we give up for the Lord, but whether or not He is worthy of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we think it is a great thing for a prince to preach the gospel, we still do not know the Lord's honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our Lord is worthy!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is worthy to receive service from all the outstanding men in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord is qualified to receive men's absolute, complete, and unlimited love!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not love Him, He is colder than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Work always follows love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not have an absolute love toward the Lord, the Lord will never commit the care of His sheep to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 38:"And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Loving the Lord is the Lord's unique requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To love the Lord, one must deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord did not mention His own cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When He was baptized, the Lord already counted Himself to have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, here it speaks of taking the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To be crucified is a once-for-all matter in His crucifixion the Lord carried us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Taking the cross is a daily matter in our taking of the cross we carry Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What does it mean to take the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It means that we submit to God from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the garden of Gethsemane the Lord determined to fulfill the Father's will; then He went forth to take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, to take the cross is to determine that we want only to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verse 39:"He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In Greek lose is a kindred word of perish.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"Finds his soul-life" is in the present age; "shall lose it" refers to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"Loses his soul-life for My sake" is in the present age; "shall find it" refers to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thus, the condition is the same, and the only difference is in time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In other Gospels, instead of the word find, the word save is used Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Greek word for soul-life means "soul."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and pleasures today and not allow it to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since finding the soul-life is explained in this way, losing the soul-life must be explained in the opposite way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to have no enjoyment or pleasure so that you feel that you suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the suffering of loss mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A believer once said that if one does not feel he is suffering loss, he is not really suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, to suffer loss here must be something that can be felt.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, to "lose" means to be dissatisfied, whereas to "find" means to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The salvation of the soul is fundamentally different from the salvation of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Verse 40:"He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is only when we take up the cross to follow the Lord that He would consider those who receive us as receiving Him and those who receive Him as receiving the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord and the Father have such a union.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Verse 41:What is mentioned here is a most wonderful and glorious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Here, the Lord reveals the deepest intention within man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The decision one makes concerning a certain truth is an indication of his condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When you receive a prophet or a righteous man, your spirit is the same as his.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>You are joined to the prophet's teaching, and you are also joined to the righteous one's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Thus, you will receive the reward that they will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Verse 42:"And whoever gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Anything that is done for the sake of the Lord will be rewarded.</S>
