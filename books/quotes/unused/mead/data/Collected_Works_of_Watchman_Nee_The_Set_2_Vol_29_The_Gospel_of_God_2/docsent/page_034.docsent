   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REWARD BEING THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people know that there is a difference between salvation and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there are many people who do not see what the reward is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible, whether with the Lord Jesus, or with the apostles, the words they spoke concerning the reward and the kingdom were not spoken lightly, in the same way the gift and eternal life were not spoken of lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord Jesus says in the Gospel of John that He gives eternal life to His sheep, He is speaking reality and not some empty words John 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 6 says that the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord v. 23 . It is so clear that the gift of God is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What then is the reward?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible clearly shows us that the reward is the crown, the throne, and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of the heavens is the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, there are three aspects to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first aspect, the kingdom of the heavens is theoutward manifestation of God's authority today; it is the outward manifestation of God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible calls this the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second aspect is the authority of the heavens controlling and limiting man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is also called the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, there is a third aspect of the kingdom of the heavens; it refers to the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's sermon on the mount in Matthew 5 7 speaks of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These teachings of the Lord tell us how man can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 5 7 repeatedly speaks of the matter of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We see very clearly that the words "the kingdom of the heavens" and the word "reward" are found together many times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many are familiar with the Beatitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Chinese call them the Eight Blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, there are nine blessings in the Beatitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The kingdom of the heavens is mentioned twice in these few blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the end, the Lord says, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" Matt 5:11-12 . Here we must admit that the reward is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord begins by saying that this kind and that kind of people are blessed because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the end He says that these people are blessed because their reward is great in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These parallel sentences show us that the kingdom of the heavens is God's reward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the sermon on the mount, the Lord mentioned the matter of the reward many times because this portion concerns the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew 5:46 says, "For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Matthew 6:1-2 says, "But take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 5 says, "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites...They have their reward in full."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 16 says, "And when you fast, do not be like the sullen-faced hypocrites...They have their reward in full."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 4 says, "So that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 6 says, "But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The last part of verse 18 says, "And your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every reader of the Bible agrees that the main subject of the sermon on the mount in Matthew 5 7 is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But here, the matter of reward is also repeatedly mentioned because the kingdom of the heavens is the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 16:27-28 says, "For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father and with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God will reward or punish a saved person according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are three facts here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, man will be rewarded according to his works.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The matter of reward is entirely based on works.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, at what time will the reward be given out?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will be given out when Christ comes in the glory of His Father with His angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Christ comes in the glory of His Father with His angels, that will be the time for Him to establish His kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, it is only when the kingdom begins that the reward will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Third, here is a type which speaks of a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The transfiguration of the Lord on the mountain typifies His manifestation in glory in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By that time some believers will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The verses in Matthew 6 which we just read regarding the reward for giving, the reward for prayer, and the reward for fasting all involve reward.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some think that the reward for prayer is God's answering of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But this is not all that is meant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus said that we have to pray to our Father who is in secret, and our Father who sees in secret will repay us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It may be possible to interpret this as the Father answering our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, both in the first part when the Lord mentions alms-giving, and in the second part when He mentions fasting, He said, "And your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This repaying must refer to something in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, the Lord said that we have to pray to the Father who sees in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not say that the Father hears in secret, but that He sees in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When God gives out the reward in the future, He gives according to what He sees.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God sees with His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, the reward is in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Revelation 11:15 says, "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 18 says, "And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This verse clearly shows us that when the Lord becomes King and the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, that is the time for giving the reward to the saints, to the small and to the great.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In other words, the time of the kingdom is the time of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Whenever the kingdom comes, the reward will come also.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is a further point.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The reward is the obtaining of the crown and the obtaining of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once a Western missionary told me, "If I cannot have the crown, at least I can have the kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You can ask King Edward of England, if he loses his crown, will he still have the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What is a crown?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is not merely a hat beaten with gold and studded with diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>That kind of crown can be gained with a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What is a crown?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A crown represents position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It also represents glory in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If a crown is only a physical thing, it does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If one has money, he can make a golden one.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If he does not have money, he can make a brass one or an iron one.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even if one is very poor, he can still make a crown out of cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the future, it will not be a matter of one crown being bigger than the other in size, or one crown having more diamonds than the other.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A crown stands for something.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When one loses the crown, he loses the thing that the crown represents.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have to see that the crown is the symbol of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What is the throne?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles will sit on twelve thrones.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The crown is a reward for the overcomers, and the throne is also a reward for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Hence, the throne is also a symbol of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It represents position in the kingdom, authority in the kingdom, and glory in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is no such thing as losing the crown but still having the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Similarly, one cannot lose the throne but still have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If one loses the throne, he will lose the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Similarly, if one loses the crown, he will lose the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The throne and the crown are not significant in themselves; they are there simply to represent the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In other words, the reward is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Bible clearly shows us that the reward is simply the kingdom.</S>
