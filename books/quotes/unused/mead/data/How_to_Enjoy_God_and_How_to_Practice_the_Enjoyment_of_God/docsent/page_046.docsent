   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Examples of Enjoying God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through Mingling Reading with Praying</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, when we spend time with the Lord, whether in the morning or at any other time, we should have two kinds of Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should have the Bible that is engraved on our heart and sealed by the Holy Spirit, and we should have a visible Bible that we hold in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is preferable for the visible Bible to be a pocket-size version so that we can take it with us and read it wherever we may be.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our reading we can mingle praying with reading; we can pray-read and read-pray the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of reading can be done at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not legal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, according to our experience, morning is the best time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Meditating to Turn the Word into Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are ready to enjoy God through prayer, we should be calm, call our entire being back to our spirit, and touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spontaneously we may utter a prayer, saying, Lord, as I read Your Word, open it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After praying we can then read.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may read Romans 8:1-2, which says, There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not read these verses quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two verses are sufficient for us to muse on.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not muse merely on the words themselves; rather, our musing should be based on these words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, we muse through and by God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can muse on the Lord, His redemption, His indwelling, our union with Him, and His being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should read the verses again, not merely with our mind but by absorbing the riches in the Word with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say, There is no more condemnation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How sweet it is to be in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Adam I was condemned and destined to die, but now I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am a person in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christ there is no more condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, in Christ there is no death!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After musing and meditating in this way, we will spontaneously be filled with thanksgiving and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say, Lord, I praise You that I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am in You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no condemnation in You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is difficult to determine whether this is reading or praying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Within the praying there is reading, and within the reading there is praying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is our prayer, but the words are from Romans 8:1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to pray-read and read-pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The two are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best way to absorb, eat, and drink God is to mingle our prayer and our reading in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we merely read the Bible, it will remain in our mind and be dead letters to us; we will not touch, eat, or drink God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we turn the words that we read into prayer, the letter of the Word is brought into the realm of the Spirit and becomes a spring of water in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we are inwardly nourished and watered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After praying and reading in this way, the Spirit comes to us with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are enlightened and become clear concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By having the Spirit and the Word in this way, we enjoy God in a rich, deep, clear, practical, and strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We eat and drink Him and are filled with His Spirit and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After some time we may proceed to verse 2: For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may speak to the Lord in the way of praying and reading, saying, Lord, I know that the Spirit of life is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Spirit of life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This Spirit is within me as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He enlivens and invigorates me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit is the Spirit of life within me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank You that there is a law, a spontaneous power, within the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This law is within me, causing me to overcome the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, my will can never deliver me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I thank You that You are within me as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are the law of life, the power of life, that spontaneously delivers me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This can be compared to reading, but it is also praying.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way we touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This way of reading the Word is nourishing; it is not dull or dry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through this way of reading we touch God, and His word is brought into His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The words of the Bible are like fine flour, and the Spirit is the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of reading mingles the fine flour with the oil and mingles the oil with the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result, we are nourished and watered.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the most profitable way to read the Word.</S>
