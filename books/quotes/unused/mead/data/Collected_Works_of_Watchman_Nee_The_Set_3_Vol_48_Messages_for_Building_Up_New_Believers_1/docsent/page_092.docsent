   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us look at 2 Chronicles 20:20-22.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here was a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nation of Judah was coming to an end at the time of Jehoshaphat's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was very weak; everything was in a state of shambles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Moabites, Ammonites, and the people of Mount Seir came to invade Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Judah was completely in despair; they felt that defeat was certain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jehoshaphat was a revived king and a God-fearing person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, none of the last kings of Judah was perfect, but nevertheless, Jehoshaphat was a person seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He told Judah to believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He appointed singers to sing praises to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also asked these ones to praise the beauty of holiness and to walk out before the army and to say, "Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please note the words when they began in the following verse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a very precious word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they began means at that very moment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When everyone was singing praises to Jehovah, He rose to smite the Ammonites, Moabites, and the people of Mount Seir.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing moves the Lord's hand as quickly as praise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prayer is not the fastest way to move the Lord's hand; praise is the fastest way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please do not misunderstand that we do not have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to pray, and we need to pray every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we can overcome many things only by praising.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we see that spiritual victory does not depend on warfare but on praising.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to learn to overcome Satan by our praise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We overcome Satan not only by prayer but also by praise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people are conscious of Satan's ferocity and their own weaknesses, and they resolve to struggle and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we find a very unique principle here: Spiritual victory does not depend on warfare but on praise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's children often are tempted to think that their problems are too big and that they have to find some way to deal with their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They pay much attention to finding a way to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the more they try to come up with a way, the harder it is for them to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In doing so, they put themselves on Satan's level.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are both in the battle; Satan is fighting on one side, and they are fighting on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not easy to win from this position.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But 2 Chronicles 20 gives a different picture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On one side was the army, and on the other side was the singing of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These ones either had great faith in God, or they were crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank God, we are not crazy people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are those who have faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many of God's children are under severe trials; they are frequently tested.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the trials become severe and the warfare turns fierce, they are like Jehoshaphat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are shut in by their trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One side is too strong, and the other side too weak; there is no comparison between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are trapped inside the whirling wind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their problems are too great and beyond their ability to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At such times, it is easy for them to turn their attention to their problems; it is easy for their eyes to be set on their own difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more a man goes through trials, the easier it is for him to be bound by his problems.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This becomes a great time of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The greatest test comes when he looks at himself or his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more a man is tested, the more he tends to look at himself or his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But for those who know God, the more they are tested, the more they put their trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more they are tested, the more they learn to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we must learn not to set our eyes on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must learn to set our eyes on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should lift up our heads and tell the Lord, "You are above everything; I praise You!"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Loud praises, praises that issue from the heart, and the praises that flow out of wounded feelings are the sacrifices of praise pleasing and acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once the sacrifice of praise ascends to God, the enemy, Satan, is defeated by the praise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The sacrifice of praise is very effective before God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let your loftiest praises burst forth to God, and you will surely withstand and overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you praise, you will find the way of victory opening wide before your eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>New believers should not think that they have to pass through many years before they can learn the lesson of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They should realize that they can start praising immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every time you encounter a problem, you should pray for mercy that you would stop manipulating and plotting and that you would learn the lesson of praising instead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Much warfare can be won by praise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many battles are lost because of the lack of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you believe in God, you can tell the Lord in the midst of your problems, "I praise Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You are higher than everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are stronger than everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Your lovingkindness endures forever!"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A person who praises God transcends everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He overcomes continually by his praise.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a principle, and this is also a fact.</S>
