 <h2 class="head1">II. THE WAY TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. According to the Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;As His anointing...has taught you, abide in Him [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>The anointing mentioned here is the moving of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us. Such moving of the Holy Spirit in us, as the ointment anointing us within, teaches us the truth. We should abide in the Lord according to the teaching of this anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Walking as the Lord Walked</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who says he abides in Him [Christ] ought himself also to walk even as that One walked&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:6).</p>
<p>To abide in Christ, on the one hand, we must be according to the teaching of the anointing of the Holy Spirit inwardly, and on the other hand, we must walk as the Lord walked outwardly. This means that we must abide in Christ according to the teaching of the Holy Spirit inwardly and according to the walk of the Lord outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Keeping God&rsquo;s Commandments</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And he who keeps His [God&rsquo;s] commandments abides in Him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:24).</p>
<p>To abide in Christ, in addition to being according to the teaching of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and walking as the Lord walked, we must keep God&rsquo;s commandments, God&rsquo;s charges to us, and be those who are submissive to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE ISSUE OF ABIDING IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Abiding in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Abide in Me [Christ] and I in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:4); <strong>&ldquo;...abides in Him [God], and He in him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:24).</p>
<p>The first issue of our abiding in Christ is that Christ and God abide in us to dispense Their riches to us, supplying and transfusing them into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Bearing Much Fruit to Glorify God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who abides in Me [Christ] and I in him, he bears much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5). <strong>&ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:8).</p>
<p>If we abide in Christ, He also will abide in us, enabling us to enjoy all the riches of His life. Thus, we will bear much fruit to glorify God, that is to live out God that He may be expressed in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Boldly Meeting the Lord<br />
and Not Being Put to Shame</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Abide in Him [Christ], that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:28).</p>
<p>If we abide in Christ and bear much fruit by His life to glorify God, when He is manifested, we will boldly meet Him and not be put to shame from His glorious presence (cf. Matt. 25:30).</p>
