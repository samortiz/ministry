<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>ii. Two Hundred Pomegranates</H2><P>Verse 20 says, "And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital" (Heb.). Hallelujah for the two hundred pomegranates! Around each capital was a projection, like a belly. Encompassing the projection on each capital were two rows of a hundred pomegranates each. This indicates two times of a hundredfold expression of the riches of life. If you contact these elders who daily bear the responsibility in the intermixed and complicated situation, you will see that they express pomegranates, the riches of life. All the complaints, dissatisfactions, and troubling telephone calls eventually form a projection full of pomegranates. How wonderful this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>jj. The Capitals Being Four Cubits in Diameter</H2><P>The diameter of each of the capitals is four cubits (1 Kings 7:19). This indicates that the number twelve, the circumference of the pillars, is composed of four times three. While the circumference of the pillar is twelve cubits, the diameter of the capitals is four cubits. This implies that the pillars with their capitals are the number four, that is, the creatures, human beings, but that they are multiplied by the Triune God. Being mingled with the Triune God, they eventually become the number twelve. If you put all this together, you will see that it is very meaningful. It implies that those who judge and condemn themselves and count themselves as nothing will be able to bear the responsibility in full in the midst of a complicated situation because they do not live by themselves but by God. Eventually, they do not express their capability, qualification, intelligence, understanding, and wisdom&#151;they express pomegranates, the riches of life two-hundredfold.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>kk. Two Pillars Standing in the Porch of the Temple</H2><P>Finally, we are told that the names of these two pillars were Jachin and Boaz (1 Kings 7:21). Jachin means, "He shall establish," and Boaz means, "In it is strength." These two pillars standing on the porch testify that the Lord will establish His building and that genuine strength is in the building. Even today, the building of the church gives this testimony. By the details of the picture in 1 Kings 7, we see how we can be a pillar in the building of God, judging ourselves, living by faith, bearing the responsibility, and expressing the riches of life.</P>
