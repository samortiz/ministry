   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE VISION OF CONSECRATION Scripture Reading: Acts 1:12-14; Rev 3:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing chapters we have covered the vision of Christ, the vision of the church, the vision of the Body, the vision of the self, and the vision of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we need to consider the vision of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we will see, this vision is of a particular kind of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BOUND BY THE FLESH, THE SELF, AND THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have pointed out that fallen people are bound by a cord composed of three strands: the flesh, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The flesh is the human body corrupted by the sinful nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin is nothing less than the sinful nature of Satan injected into the human body, which had been created by God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Romans 6 and 7 sin is personified and likened to a living person who dwells in us, works in us, and reigns in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have the flesh in the body, so we have the self in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The self is the soul plus the satanic mind, the satanic thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The human body has become the flesh and the human soul has become the self, but what has happened to the human spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There seems to be nothing wrong with the human spirit, for, in contrast to the body and the soul, there is nothing evil or sinful in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No, there is nothing sinful in the human spirit, but nevertheless the human spirit has been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirit has been deadened by the sin in the body and by the self in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more sinful we are, the more our spirit is deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, the more self-seeking we are, the more our spirit is deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Human beings are bound not only by the flesh and the self but also by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan has systematized all the things on earth which are necessary for human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These things include food, marriage, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord provides everything necessary for our existence so that we may live to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, Satan has come in to systematize these things into a system which in the Greek New Testament is called the kosmos and in English is called the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Originally all these things were on earth for human existence, and there was nothing wrong with them, but Satan came in to change the earthly things into worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan transmuted the human body into the flesh and changed the human soul into the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same principle, Satan has changed the earthly things the things that were originally on earth for man's existence into worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These things have become elements of Satan's system, the world, in which all people are imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man has been systematized by Satan and has no freedom to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How evil and how subtle Satan is!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan has corrupted the human body with sin, causing the body to become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan has polluted the human soul with the satanic mind, causing the soul to become the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan has systematized all the earthly things that are necessary for human existence, organizing them into one system, the world.</S>
