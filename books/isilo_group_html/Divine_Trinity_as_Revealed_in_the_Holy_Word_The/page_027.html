IN THE CASE OF DEBORAH</h2>
<p>Judges 5 is the song of Deborah and Barak. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;Curse Meroz, says the Angel of Jehovah; / Bitterly curse its inhabitants. / For they did not come to the aid of Jehovah, / To the aid of Jehovah against the mighty.&rdquo; The Angel of Jehovah is Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah is the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s involvement in Deborah&rsquo;s victory over Sisera, the captain of the Canaanite army, was for her and her followers to enjoy the Triune God. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Awake! Awake, Deborah! / Awake! Awake, speak forth a song! / Arise, Barak; / And lead captive your captives.&rdquo; Verses 15 through 16 say, &ldquo;The princes in Issachar were with Deborah; / And Issachar was true to Barak; / Into the valley they were sent behind him. / Among the divisions of Reuben / There were great resolutions in heart. / Why did you sit among the sheepfolds / Listening to the pipings for the flocks? / In the divisions of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart.&rdquo; These verses indicate that when Deborah was stirred up by the Triune God, Barak came in to help her. Then many of the defeated children of Israel were stirred up as well, and they seriously considered their situation and made a strong decision to follow Deborah and Barak to fight the enemies. A great resolution in heart is a firm decision. We need to search our heart and strongly resolve to fight for God. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;May all Your enemies so perish, O Jehovah. / But may those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might.&rdquo; When we consider these verses together, we can see that Deborah, Barak, and those who followed them to fight the battle were enjoying the Triune God.</p>

IN THE CASE OF GIDEON</h2>
<p>Judges 6:12 says, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah appeared to him [Gideon] and said to him, Jehovah is with you.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Jehovah turned to him and said, Go in this strength of yours, and save Israel from the hand of Midian.&rdquo; We should not say that we are weak and do not have strength. What we have is enough; we need to go with whatever we have. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;Gideon went and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in unleavened cakes...And he brought it out to Him...And he presented it.&rdquo; Verses 21 through 26 say, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And fire came up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes...Gideon saw that He was the Angel of Jehovah. And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! For I have seen the Angel of Jehovah face to face. And Jehovah said to him, Peace be with you...Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and he called it Jehovah-shalom...Jehovah said to him, Take your father&rsquo;s bull...And build an altar to Jehovah your God...And offer a burnt offering.&rdquo; Verse 34 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the trumpet.&rdquo; When Gideon blew the trumpet, many followed him.</p>
<p>As in the case of Deborah, in the case of Gideon the Angel of Jehovah was Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah was the Triune God. The kid typifies Christ as our burnt offering, and the unleavened cakes typify Christ as our meal offering. The fire typifies God as the accepting agent. We have seen that such a consuming, devouring, accepting fire is God Himself (Heb. 12:29). The rock signifies Christ as the ground for God to grace His people. The Lord Jehovah is the Triune God as the Lord. <em>Jehovah-shalom</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is peace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah of peace.&rdquo; <em>God</em> in Judges 6:26 in Hebrew is Elohim, indicating the Triune God. The burnt offering typifies Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Finally, the Spirit of Jehovah is the Spirit of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s involvement in Gideon&rsquo;s victory over the Midianites was for Gideon to enjoy the Triune God with His redemption in Christ and with the Spirit. The sacrificed animals indicate redemption. Jehovah, the Angel of Jehovah, and the Spirit of Jehovah imply God, the Son of God sent by Him, and the Spirit of God, indicating the Trinity.</p>

IN THE CASE OF JEPHTHAH</h2>
<p>Judges 11:29-30 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah...And Jephthah made a vow to Jehovah.&rdquo; Verse 32 says, &ldquo;Jephthah passed on to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.&rdquo; We can see the Trinity involved here because there is the Spirit of Jehovah, who is the Spirit of the Triune God, and Jehovah, who is the Triune God. The Divine Trinity was for Jephthah&rsquo;s victory over the Ammonites.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Trinity as Revealed in the Holy Word &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
