   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us apply these words to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How do we keep and not damage the oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How do we allow God to build this oneness into us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Practically speaking, whenever we desire to take an action or express an opinion, we should ask ourselves, Am I in Christ in taking this action or expressing this opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Am I walking with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we would ask these questions, we will become clear, and there will be no need for others to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s building work is to build Himself into us and to build us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we allow Him to build Himself into us, He will be with us in our living, and in our every move He will walk with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we allow God to build us into Himself, all our conduct and living will have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, we and He, He and we, will become one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In all that we do, He will be in us and we will be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regrettably, our response to the Spirit s work within us is often: Wait a minute; I want to say this first, or Let me do this first.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we continue to walk carelessly after hearing these messages, this shows that we are willing to push the Spirit aside and are unwilling to allow Him to interfere or intervene in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is this our condition?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if we have some light and some feeling within, the oneness of the church will be damaged by our unwillingness to surrender ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this is our situation, we cannot express Christ, live out Christ, be God s resting place, be Christ s counterpart, fight for God, or let God rule over us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything depends on oneness; this oneness is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If, through the cross, we allow Christ to have the ground in us to destroy all the differences in us, the oneness will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When this oneness is manifested, there will be one Body, one dwelling place, one bride, one warrior, and one city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>AND THE GOSPEL BOOK ROOM</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning financial support, according to the leading we have received from the Lord, any offering to an individual should be put in the offering box when an offerer has been led by the Lord to make an offering through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church has no right to open such an envelope, just as we have no right to open other people s mail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when an offering needs to be sent to a distant place should the church open the envelope and remit the money through a bank.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church has no right to open envelopes containing offerings designated for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the Lord and those who are receiving support should know how much support is received.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This should be a secret before God, which shows that this matter is under the authority of the Spirit, not under human control.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we continue to receive mercy and keep this position by giving the Spirit the absolute position, lordship, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one and nothing among us should replace the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would also like to fellowship concerning the matter of caring for the Lord s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a difficult point to fellowship because we do not want to neglect this responsibility or pass this responsibility on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not our intention to lighten our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May the Lord be gracious to us and enable us to bear our responsibility before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please allow me to say that the saints in all the localities should faithfully care for the Lord s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I solemnly declare that by the Lord s grace I will do my best to care for the needs of my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, this should not lessen your burden before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am concerned that some may think that I am laying a heavy burden on you; actually, I only hope that you could receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the localities should follow the Lord s leading and care for those who serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify on their behalf that if they wanted to earn a living in the world, they could be much better off than they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For the Lord s sake they gave up their future and are willing to be in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, most of their service is rendered to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the churches should take care of their needs before the Lord according to the grace they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no person or organization among us that can replace the saints in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The saints need to learn to bear the responsibility of these workers before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please understand me; this is not an effort to increase your burden while decreasing mine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no person or organization that can force the saints to care for the Lord s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I beg you to understand my feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord grant us grace to see that everything we have is before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May we also learn to live before the Lord so that the churches in all the localities may be before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please do not misunderstand my words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Taiwan Gospel Book Room does not belong to the churches or to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a burden I received from the Lord and is something of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to my experience I realize that the co-workers have many difficulties and needs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So I received a burden from the Lord to prepare a place for the co-workers and for those learning to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This place was not prepared by the churches; it was prepared by my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, I do not discuss anything related to the Gospel Book Room and this place with the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are not financially dependent on the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if the churches are willing and able, they should consider assisting in this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many things done by the ministry are done in order to make up a lack from the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A basic principle in the Bible is that the ministry should transfer a burden to the churches when they are able to bear that burden.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the churches are short in a certain matter, the ministry needs to make up the shortage; if the ministry does not accept the leading from the Lord, that burden will not be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a word of fellowship concerning the Gospel Book Room and the place for the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe the saints are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May the Lord grant us grace not to restrict the Holy Spirit.</S>
