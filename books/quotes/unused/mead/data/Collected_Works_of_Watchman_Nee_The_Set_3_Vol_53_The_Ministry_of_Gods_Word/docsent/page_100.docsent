   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Second, the spirit must be watchfully attended to before it can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As soon as our mind wanders, moves out of focus, or fails to catch up with our thoughts, our spirit is injured.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our mind has to attentively wait on the spirit before the spirit can direct the mind freely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When our mind wanders, our spirit becomes very heavy and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is another cause of injury to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some ministers of the word cannot use their spirit because their spirit is injured, and their spirit is injured because something is wrong with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to learn to preserve our mind solely for the spirit's use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our mind has to attentively wait on the spirit, like a servant waiting on his master.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more experienced we are, the more conscious we are of this need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, in order for the spirit to be strong and undamaged, we have to use the right words whenever we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot use the wrong words, the wrong examples, or the wrong order of outline.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once we make a mistake in two or three of the crucial words in our speaking, our whole message is spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These few words injure our spirit, and at the end of the whole message, our spirit remains bound.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, there are times when the situation is less serious, and one or two wrong words do not lead to an injured spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At these times, we can still release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes we also may give an illustration which is out of place as far as the spirit is concerned, and the spirit is injured again and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or we may tell a story that is not according to the Spirit's utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In such a case, again the spirit is injured and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A whole passage may not be according to the Spirit; that is, we have not touched the leading of the Spirit in speaking it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again the spirit is injured and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must remember that it is very easy for the spirit to be injured.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not pay attention to this matter but insist on speaking carelessly, we will find it impossible to push out our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may want to release our spirit, but we do not have the power to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that we have injured our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, our attitude can also injure our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people come to the meeting with much self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Self-consciousness is something that easily injures our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While a person is speaking, he may be very conscious of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may think that his audience is very demanding, and that a few are even quite threatening.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While he is speaking, he has many feelings about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is self- consciousness, and it bottles up the spirit so that it cannot be released freely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once the soul reigns, self-consciousness rises, and the spirit loses control.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must realize that there is a difference between spiritual fear and soulish consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to have a spiritual fear, but we have no need of soulish self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we meet together in a certain place, we should be filled with fear, but we should not be filled with a soulish self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that we cannot make it and that we have no strength in ourselves to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we come to the meeting, we come in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a fear turns our eyes to God, to look to Him, to trust Him, and to rest our faith on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Soulish self-consciousness is different; it looks at men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A spiritual fear turns our eyes to God, while a soulish self-consciousness turns our eyes to men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once soulish self-consciousness arises, our spirit is injured and debilitated; we are unable to push out our spirit any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>An evangelist must be free from self-consciousness before he can preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All gospel preachers throughout the ages have been men with no self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The less self-conscious a preacher is, the more powerful his spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As he stands to speak, he has no feeling for the heavens, the earth, or men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Though these things are all before his eyes, he speaks what is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is oblivious to others' approval or disapproval.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This freedom from self-consciousness is the basic qualification of a preacher of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It lifts a person's spirit up; when he preaches, men will turn.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A minister of God's word must learn to free himself from any self-consciousness before he can function effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man is sensitive about many things while speaking God's word, if he is afraid of men or afraid that others will not listen to him, this fear will damage his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he stands up to speak, his spirit is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His spirit is not strong enough to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those ministers of the word who fail to practice this wilt away easily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a preacher of the gospel feels that his audience is older, more prestigious, or more educated or knowledgeable than he is, he will not be able to deliver his message well, no matter how hard he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more he speaks, the less boldness he has.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once an evangelist reckons others to be great, he will reckon himself small.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if he magnifies the gospel, others will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A preacher of the gospel must be able to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we convey God's word to others, any sense of inferiority lowers God's word, and our spirit becomes weak and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although words may come out, the spirit is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order for a servant of God to have the ministry of the word, he must not have any feeling of inferiority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A fear of men is not a mark of humility but a soulish sense of inferiority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of inferiority is soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is far from spiritual humility.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Spiritual humility comes when we see ourselves under God's shining and are humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Soulish inferiority, however, comes from introspection which, in turn, comes from self-examination and a fear of men.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A man with an inferiority complex may be proud and arrogant at times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>None of these expressions relate to true humility.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Soulish self-consciousness is a kind of soulish inferiority complex.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It damages the spirit and puts it out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, when we stand before men, we need to be in fear and trembling as well as bold and assured.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need both.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are short of one aspect, our spirit will be injured, and once our spirit is injured, we are not able to serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever we speak as a minister of the word, we have to learn to preserve our spirit from any injury.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once our spirit is injured, we can no longer use it.</S>
