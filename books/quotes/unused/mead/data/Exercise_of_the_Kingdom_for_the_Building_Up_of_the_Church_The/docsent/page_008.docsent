   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE KEYS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 21 through 26 not only expose the gates, but also reveal the keys.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first key is the denial of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Self is an open gate, but self-denial is the key that shuts it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second key is the taking up of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the cross is a key to shut up the self, the soul, and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third key is the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the three keys here are the denying of the self, the taking up of the cross, and the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Day by day we need to use these keys.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yes, Peter used the keys on the day of Pentecost and in the household of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we also need the three subjective keys found in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principalities and powers in the heavenlies are gates.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in addition, the self, the soul, and the mind are three crucial subjective gates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If these subjective gates are locked, no principalities or powers will be able to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE CHURCH DAMAGED BY THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My burden in this message is not interpretation; it is application.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout history, the church has not been damaged mainly by Judaism or Gnosticism; it has been damaged mainly by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Martin Luther once said that although he was afraid of the pope, he was more afraid of the stronger pope, the self, within his own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing damages and frustrates the building up of the church more than the self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Self is the embodiment of the soul, which is expressed through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus the self, the soul, and the mind are three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Behind these three is Satan, who manipulates the self in order to damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to heed this word for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Simply because of the self, certain saints have left the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1948 there was a certain brother in Shanghai who was full of self and whose soul was an open gate that no one could lock.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was ambitious to be an elder, and he often complained about the situation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day he stood up in a meeting to speak many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After his negative speaking, I said, Brother, there is no need for us to waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you can find a better place, please tell me about it and I ll go there with you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if you cannot find a better place, please be quiet and remain here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had nothing more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A short while later, he stopped coming to the church meetings, began a meeting in his home, and hired a traveling preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With the financial support of this dissenting brother, this preacher wrote a long article opposing Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No doubt, this brother damaged the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, he himself lost the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was due to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this brother, there was no building, for he did not become a Peter, but remained the son of Bar-jona.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was the result of Satan coming out through the self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SERIOUSNESS OF BEING OFFENDED</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me honestly and lovingly say a word to you all: It is a very serious matter to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not casually say, I have been offended in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The elders and other leading ones have offended me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although others may offend you, you will always be the first to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, I condemn all the offenses; but on the other hand, I must say that there is no excuse for your being offended.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we were not in ourselves, we could not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I exercise the key of self-denial to lock up the self, it will be impossible for me to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reason we are offended is that the self is so open and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through the open gate of the self, Satan comes forth, and we are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps in certain matters the church may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not think that the church is no longer the church because it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, when your child makes a mistake, he is still your child.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether the church is right or wrong, it is still the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although you may be offended by something or someone in the church, do not make any excuses for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This frustrates the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>USING THE KEY OF SELF-DENIAL</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have seen, Matthew 16 speaks about the building up of the church and also about the gates of Hades and the keys of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without the keys to lock the gates, the church cannot be built.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because there has been so little exercise of these keys, the church has not yet been built.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may talk a great deal about the building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, when certain things take place to touch us, the self is open.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because we are open to Hades, something from Hades Satan comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How we need to use the key of self-denial to lock the self!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The way to keep from being offended by others is to lock up yourself by denying yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Blessed are those who are not offended.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no excuse for being offended.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the Lord Jesus comes and sets up His judgment seat, He will tell us to settle our account with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He may ask us why we were offended in certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if we make excuses for ourselves, the Lord will not accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The problem is not the offense it is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Certain viruses are very contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, no virus can cause a table to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you can be offended, it is a proof that you are full of self.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If my self has been locked up, I will not be offended no matter what you do to me or how you treat me.</S>
