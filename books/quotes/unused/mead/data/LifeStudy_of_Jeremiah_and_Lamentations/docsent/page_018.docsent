   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE FOUR GOD'S FAITHFULNESS IN FULFILLING HIS ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Jer 2:13; Lam 3:22-25; Jer 23:5-6; 31:33-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would like to give a further word on Jeremiah 2:13; Lamentations 3:22-25; Jeremiah 23:5-6; and 31:33-34.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The intrinsic content of these verses shows us God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>GOD'S PURPOSE IN DESIRING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO BE THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TO HIS ELECT PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jeremiah 2:13 reveals that God is the fountain of living waters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why does God desire to be the fountain of living waters for His elect people to drink that their thirst may be quenched and that they may be satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's purpose in wanting to be the fountain of living waters for His elect to drink is that He would be increased and enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians have not paid attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you ever heard that God wants to be enlarged?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When some hear this, they say, "How can God be enlarged?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is He not already large enough?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is blasphemy to say that God can be enlarged."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning this matter of God's enlargement, let us come back to the Bible and see what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God as the Satisfying Water to His Elect</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible there is the thought that God is the satisfying water to His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 36:8-9a says, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For with thee is the fountain of life."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here fatness means food, or the life supply, and the river is the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In typology the fatness of God's house refers to the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the riches that were offered to God became the fatness of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we enjoy this fatness, we drink of the river of life, the river of God's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible there are a number of places where God is signified by a river.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first is in Genesis 2:10-14.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God created man in His own image and then placed him in the garden of Eden in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The tree of life is first mentioned in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then verse 10 goes on to say, "A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This river, therefore, is closely related to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another verse which speaks of a river is Psalm 46:4.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ezekiel 47 tells of the prophet's vision of a river flowing out of the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 4 the Lord Jesus speaks of living water v. 10 and of a spring of water gushing up into eternal life v. 14 ; and in John 7, He speaks of rivers of living water v. 38 . In 1 Corinthians 10:4 we have Paul's word about spiritual drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, in Revelation 22:1 we have a word concerning the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is through the flow of this river that God's economy is accomplished.</S>
