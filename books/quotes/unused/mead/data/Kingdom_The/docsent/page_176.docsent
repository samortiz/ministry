   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sometimes we come to the meeting in an idle, sloppy, and slothful way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We excuse ourselves by saying that we are tired, and we come with no intention of functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We only come to rest and to enjoy some testimonies, to listen, and perhaps to criticize a little.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even our criticism becomes an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to be sloppy, slothful, and idle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Contrariwise, we should come to the meetings with a "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regardless of whether we are tired and regardless of our situation, we need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may be tired, but He is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are nothing, but He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are tired, but He never tires.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have nothing to say, yet we have to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have nothing to minister, but we must function by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you will open your mouth, the word will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way to dig out your buried talent is to open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don't bury your talent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dig it out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don't excuse yourself for any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many brothers and sisters have learned not to come to me with these kinds of excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I never sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they come to tell me how weak they are and how much help they need, I do not sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The weaker they are, the less I sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are weak because they say they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, you will be what you say you are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have to declare that we are not weak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians 12:10, Paul said that when he was weak, then he was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, there is no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you come to me saying that all the brothers and sisters in your place are strong and doing well, I would like to come and visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if you say how weak you are and how much help you need, I would tell you to help yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must rise up to take care of your own situation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have you noticed what the Lord said in Matthew 25:28?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord goes on to say in verse 29, "For to everyone who has shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken away from him."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the more you have, the more the Lord will give you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more you don't have, the more the Lord will take away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the Lord's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord only gives to the rich ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whoever is poor receives nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even the Lord takes away from the poor ones and gives to the rich ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To those who have ten talents, the Lord gives one more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you come to the meetings, never consider that you have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you consider that you have nothing, the Lord will take away what you do have and give it to another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Lord's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Don't think this is my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the Lord's economy revealed in Matthew 25.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times when I came to a meeting to minister, I had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when I went to the platform and opened my mouth, eventually a book came, a verse came, and the message came.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One Lord's day morning in January 1968, I stood up encouraging all of the saints to function and to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time I told them they could at least say four words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As I made this statement, within I was questioning, What four words?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then I said, "Number one," and even at that point I didn't know what word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then I said, "O," number two, "Lord," number three, "Amen," number four, "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is how the four words, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah!" came.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I arrived home after the meeting, I considered that perhaps I had given the saints the wrong order of these words.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps I should have put "Hallelujah" before "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surely "Amen" should be after everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet I told the people they could speak "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But then I remembered Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There the order is "Amen, Hallelujah!" not "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you look into the matter, you will find that to say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Amen!" is awkward for composing a song.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is difficult for anyone to make a song from these words.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But to say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hallelujah!" fits very well.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This example illustrates that if we will open our mouths in faith, the Lord will give us something to say.</S>
