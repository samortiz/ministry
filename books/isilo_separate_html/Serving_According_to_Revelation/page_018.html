<p>If we want to receive spiritual gifts and ministries, we need to earnestly desire them, and we also need to know how to receive gifts and ministries.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking</h2>
<p>We need to seek. First Corinthians 14:12 says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>seek</em> is also used in Matthew 7:7, which says, &ldquo;Seek and you shall find.&rdquo; Seeking includes petitioning, or asking, God, but seeking is not merely petitioning. Seeking requires that we take action in order to acquire. Seeking is an outward action that comes from an inward aspiration and desire. If we have an inward aspiration, the desire to have spiritual gifts, then we will take outward actions. We will make an effort to seek until we receive.</p>
<p>Many saints desire to receive spiritual gifts or ministries, but they do not want to make an effort to seek. They are either lazy and loose, or they are unwilling to pay the price. They desire in their heart, but they do not receive anything because they are unwilling to make an effort to seek. If we truly desire to receive spiritual gifts or ministries, we must spend time, make an effort, and pay the price. We must also take heed to certain matters and have the necessary dealings. After Moody had the desire to preach the gospel, he spent a great deal of time and effort seeking to receive the power and utterance needed for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecration</h2>
<p>We need consecration. Romans 12 speaks of different gifts after it speaks of presenting our bodies, that is, of having a practical and specific consecration (vv. 1, 6). God gives gifts and ministries, but we must consecrate ourselves thoroughly, unreservedly, and specifically to the Lord in order to receive them. This is logical and necessary. A person who does not present himself for the Lord&rsquo;s use cannot receive gifts or ministries from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leaving All</h2>
<p>We need to leave all. Receiving heavenly gifts and ministries depends on leaving all earthly things. Peter and John left everything before they received their gifts and ministries (Matt. 4:18-22). If we would genuinely seek spiritual gifts and ministries, we will discover that we need to leave material things because they are a hindrance to us. Many more saints would receive spiritual gifts and ministries if we would leave all the things that hinder us. If we truly want the Lord to have a free way among us, we must follow our inner sense and forsake the earthly things. There is no other way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Broken</h2>
<p>We need to be broken. Leaving all deals with things outside of us, but being broken deals with the self inside of us. Both the things outside of us and the self inside of us are hindrances that keep us from receiving spiritual gifts or ministries. The self is a greater hindrance than the things outside of us. Our temper, disposition, habits, flesh, and self need to be broken by God in order for us to receive spiritual gifts and ministries. Then there will be a clear manifestation of our spiritual function.</p>
<p>Many saints love the Lord, desire to receive spiritual gifts or ministries, and are willing to manifest their function in the church, but they are unwilling to be broken. Their temper, disposition, habits, flesh, and self remain untouched. The problems in their being annul their heart and desire for the Lord. As a result, they cannot receive what they desire to receive. If the saints in every locality would allow the Lord to break their temper, disposition, habits, flesh, and self, many more would receive useful gifts and ministries that are full of reality. Then the service in the churches would be strong and spiritual, meeting God&rsquo;s need in this age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying and Learning</h2>
<p>We need to study and learn. If we desire to receive a certain gift or ministry, we must take heed to learn the things related to that gift or ministry. If we desire to receive the gift of healing, we must take heed to the gift of healing. We need to study what is revealed in the Bible concerning healing, such as praying for the sick, the laying on of hands, and the anointing with oil (James 5:14-16). In addition to studying, we also need to exercise our faith and practice what we know.</p>
<p>If we desire to be a prophet who speaks for God, we must spend the time and make an effort to learn. To be a prophet is more difficult than receiving the gift of healing. Those who want to speak for God must spend time to study the Bible. We cannot speak for God if we do not have knowledge of the Bible. We must study the Bible carefully and thoroughly until we are familiar with it. We also need to read Bible commentaries and spiritual books written by those who have been used by the Lord. There are numerous Bible commentaries and spiritual books. We may not be able to read every publication that has been written over the past two thousand years, but we should definitely read the important publications. We should also read newspapers and magazines in order to gain general knowledge and common expressions.</p>
<p>Those who speak for God also need to practice public speaking. They need skills. They need to know how to use their throat and voice, and they need to know their intonation. If we want to speak for God, people must be able to hear and understand what we say. Therefore, we must learn to enunciate our words with the proper use of our throat and abdomen so that we speak clearly and concisely. We need to learn these things so that our words are not too loud or too soft. Our words must not lose their spiritual weight. We also need to learn other languages. Otherwise, it will be hard to manifest the gift of speaking. If we can learn several languages, our function will be greatly manifested.</p>
<p>If we desire to be an elder, we must ask God for wisdom and understanding. It is not easy to administrate the house of God or to manage the church. Leading the saints, arranging the services, handling the business affairs, and resolving problems all require wisdom and understanding. When God set Solomon as king over His people, Solomon asked for a heart of wisdom so that he might know how to go out and come in among God&rsquo;s people and how to judge them. Therefore, God gave him a heart of wisdom and understanding to rule over His people (1 Kings 3:7-12).</p>
<p>Understanding is of the mind, but wisdom is of the spirit. Understanding is ordinary, but wisdom is extraordinary. To be an elder in the church requires not only the ordinary understanding of the mind but also the extraordinary wisdom of the spirit. An elder must be able to see things that others are unable to see and to perceive things that others cannot perceive. He must be able to understand what others cannot understand and to discern what others are unable to discern. Hence, we need to ask God for wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord, He put me in a situation that involved the administration of the church. I was young and inexperienced, so I followed Solomon&rsquo;s example and asked God to give me wisdom and understanding in order to know how to administrate His church and lead His children. The Lord had mercy on me; He became my wisdom and understanding in many crucial matters. I can testify that the Lord delights in such a petition and answers such a petition.</p>
<p>A person who wants to be an elder also needs to exercise to be open-minded and to have a large heart. Our heart must be large if we would administrate the house of God. God gave Solomon not only wisdom and understanding but also &ldquo;largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore&rdquo; (4:29). There is a Chinese proverb: &ldquo;The heart needs to be as inclusive as the sea.&rdquo; However, the heart that God gave Solomon was as large as the sand on the seashore. The sand on the seashore encompasses the sea. A heart that is as large as the sand on the seashore is larger than a heart that is as inclusive as the sea. Those who are set over God&rsquo;s people need a heart that is as large as the sand on the seashore so that they can forgive anyone and endure anything. Such a heart can love the unlovable and bear the unbearable.</p>
<p>Wisdom of heart is related to largeness of heart. Solomon asked God for wisdom, and God gave him a heart of wisdom and largeness of heart. Wisdom makes the heart large, whereas foolishness makes the heart narrow. A wise person has a large heart, but a foolish person has a narrow heart. Hence, a heart that is large is wise, and a heart that is narrow is foolish. A person with a narrow heart cannot be an elder. An elder needs to be tolerant and to have a large heart because there are all kinds of people in the church. Some saints care only for themselves; they have no regard for justice or love. The elders need to have a large heart in order to tolerate and love such ones.</p>
<p>A person who wants to be an elder needs to exercise to not lose his temper. Those who lose their temper cannot administrate the house of God. Some brothers desire to be elders, but they are unwilling to deal with their temper. They love the Lord and are willing to pay the price, but it is hard for them to be elders because they freely lose their temper.</p>
<p>Our temper is related to the narrowness of our heart. Temper causes a person to have a narrow heart, and a narrow heart causes a person to be full of temper. Therefore, to deal with one&rsquo;s temper is to deal with a narrow heart. An elder will lose his status and weight among the saints if he loses his temper even once in the church. The status and weight of an elder must not be lost, because the elders uphold the spiritual atmosphere in the church. Once an elder loses his status and weight, the church will suffer an exceedingly great loss. Hence, an elder must deal with his temper until it is no longer expressed. Then he will be strong or gentle according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. An elder must have a strong yet gentle character.</p>
<p>The most precious thing in the church is the one accord among the saints, but one accord among the saints depends on one accord among the elders. If there is one accord among the elders, there will be one accord among the saints. Only those who know their temper and have dealt with their temper can be in one accord with others. One accord is not a matter of having the same opinion concerning the truth or practical matters. One accord depends on knowing one&rsquo;s temper and dealing with one&rsquo;s temper. Those who have dealt with their temper are not quick to give their opinions and do not cause trouble. Hence, those who desire to be elders must learn to deal with their temper.</p>
<p>A person who desires to be a deacon must learn to be loving, humble, and diligent. He must learn how to manage things before he can serve the church and the saints. He must also learn to listen and obey and to follow instructions instead of voicing his opinions. A saint who has many opinions and ideas cannot be a good deacon. If we want the saints to receive spiritual help and the life supply from our service, we must learn to deal with our opinions and ideas.</p>
<p>A deacon must also learn to deal with his tongue so that he is a person of few words. A deacon who talks incessantly will propagate death. If we want our service to minister life instead of propagating death, we must learn to deal with our tongue. There are many other matters that we need to learn, but I cannot cover them all in detail. May the Lord lead us to take heed to these matters and learn them properly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pursuing the Infilling and<br />
Outpouring of the Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to pursue the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit. Every spiritual gift comes from the Spirit. The ordinary gifts mentioned in Romans 12:6-8 are manifested through being filled with the Spirit inwardly. These gifts are of life. The miraculous gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:9-10 are received through the outpouring of the Spirit. The miraculous gifts are related to the inspiration of the Spirit. We must be filled with the Spirit inwardly to manifest the gifts of life. We must also experience the outpouring of the Spirit to receive the miraculous gifts. Therefore, if we desire to receive spiritual gifts, we must pursue the inward filling and the outpouring of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>May many among us desire and pursue spiritual gifts and pursue being an elder or a deacon. These matters are not for profit, fame, or reward, but they are for glory in the future and reward in that day. However, we do not need to wait until that day. We can sense the glory and joy of serving human souls for the Lord&rsquo;s sake today. Should there not be more among us who desire and pursue these matters for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>If more saints desire and pursue spiritual gifts and ministries, many will be edified and useful. They will eventually be able to help other saints to preach the gospel and to raise up strong churches everywhere. This is the only way for the propagation of the gospel and for the establishment of churches to spread quickly in a solid and steady way. May the Lord remember His work and fulfill our desire.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
