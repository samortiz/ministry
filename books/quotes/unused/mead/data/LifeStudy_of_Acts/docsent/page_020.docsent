   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE SEVEN THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2:1-13 we see the Jewish believers baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 1 through 4 are concerned with the economical filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall pay particular attention to these four verses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AND THE ECONOMICAL SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 2:1 and 2 say, And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord s resurrection, the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples John 20:22 for their spiritual being and living essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Lord s ascension, the Spirit of ascension power, poured upon the disciples, is symbolized here by the wind for the disciples ministry and move economically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to see clearly the difference between the breathing in John 20 and the blowing in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The breathing in John 20 is for the imparting of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples essentially for their spiritual being and for their spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the blowing in Acts 2 is for the pouring out of the economical Spirit of power upon the believers, who have already received the essential Spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The pouring out of the Spirit of power is not for the believers spiritual being or living; rather, the outpouring of the Spirit of power is for the believers ministry and move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the essential aspect of the Spirit is for living, and the economical aspect is for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is important for us to differentiate these two aspects of the Spirit, for then we shall understand the Gospels and Acts in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, we shall be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many years ago, a certain highly respected minister said that the breathing in John 20 was not a fact but was merely a performance that indicated that the fact was yet to come in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to his understanding, after the performance in John 20, it was necessary for the disciples to wait fifty days to receive the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the view of this minister, both John 20 and Acts 2 refer to the same thing, the difference being that one describes a performance and the other describes a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This concept is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have pointed out, there is a difference between the breathing in John 20 and the blowing in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Breathing is for life, but blowing is for power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Gospel of John the Spirit of life in resurrection is likened to water for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 4:14 says, Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 7:37-39 says, Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Luke 24:49 the economical Spirit is likened to clothing that we put on: And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Water is for life inwardly, and clothing is for work outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us use a policeman as an illustration of the difference between the essential Spirit for life inwardly and the economical Spirit for power outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A policeman does not put on his uniform in order to quench his thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thirst cannot be quenched by putting on a uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A policeman clothes himself with a uniform when he is about to go on duty, that is, when he is ready to work as a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a policeman drank something to quench his thirst and then went to work without his uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he did this, no one would pay attention to him as he tried to give orders on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how much he may drink to quench his thirst, a policeman still must put on his uniform when he is about to work as a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he is clothed in his uniform, others will respect him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through this illustration we can see the difference between drinking and being clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Drinking is inward, but being clothed is an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a serious mistake to say, as did that minister years ago, that the breathing in John 20 is a performance and the blowing in Acts 2 is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of interpretation comes from the shortage of proper knowledge and leads to confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The proper knowledge we need requires not only the study of the Scriptures but also heavenly enlightenment along with adequate experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not accurate to say that in John 20 Peter did not receive the Spirit of life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s breathing in that chapter was certainly not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to John 20:22, the Lord Jesus breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a performance it is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we have the fact of the breathing of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples on the day of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The divine breath in John 20:22 is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In particular, this reaching took place in John 20.</S>
