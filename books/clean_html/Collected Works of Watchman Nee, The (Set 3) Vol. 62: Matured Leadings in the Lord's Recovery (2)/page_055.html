<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: March 1, 1950<br />Place: Jordan Road, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Principles Operating in the Church</h2><p>There are two spiritual principles in the church. The first is authority. The other side of authority is submission. If the church does not have authority, it will be filled with the flesh. If there is only authority, however, the church will be full of the law; it will be like a law court. Therefore, the second thing is love. Only love builds up.</p><h2 class="head2">Arrangements for the Services</h2><p>In order to carry out the visitation work in an orderly fashion, we have divided the visitation into a few smaller groups and asked a few brothers and sisters to take charge of them: 1) transportation of out-of-town visitors, 2) special visitations, 3) correspondence, 4) &ldquo;nursing mothers,&rdquo; and 5) love feasts. (In Greek the word <i>agape</i> means &ldquo;love&rdquo; only.)</p><p>The scope of service of the deacons&rsquo; office includes all the details of the business affairs of the church. The affairs of the church are complicated. Therefore, we cannot ask one individual to head up this matter. Instead, the fourteen deacons should take turns heading up this work.</p><h2 class="head2">Neither Democracy nor Authoritarianism</h2><p>Every institution in the world has rules of conduct for the facilitation and order of conducting business. In order to facilitate and order the spiritual things in the church, there are also rules of conduct. Before the brothers and sisters handed themselves over, it was impossible for the whole church to rise up to serve; many held to the concept that as long as someone was taking care of the responsibilities, they could sit back. Now everything is different. All the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over, and the whole church has risen up to serve. Every brother and sister must have a part in the things related to the church. There is the need of some kind of arrangement because so many people are serving in the church. Without this, it will be easy to fall into confusion. In making decisions, the worldly way is to vote by hand or ballot. The minority yields to the majority. In some places authoritarianism prevails. In such places one man or a few men decide everything. Today there are ways of conducting business in every secular society. The way to serve in the church, however, is different from the way of the world. Church service is according to God&rsquo;s revelation in His Word. We must take the biblical way of making decisions in the church. If the church does not take the biblical way of making decisions, I am afraid worldly ways will creep in.</p><p>The last church spoken of in Revelation 2 and 3 is the church in Laodicea. It comes after the church in Philadelphia. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the last church is very strong. The word <i>Laodicea</i> is <i>Laodikeia</i> in Greek. It is made up of two words: <i>laos </i>and <i>dikeia.</i> <i>Laos</i> means the people, and <i>dikeia</i> means three things according to the lexicon: 1) customs and habits, 2) rights, 3) demands, judgments, and revenge. Hence, the word <i>Laodicea</i> means the people&rsquo;s customs, rights, and judgments. The best way to express it is &ldquo;people&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo; In Revelation 2 and 3, the word <i>laos</i> is used three times. Two times it is embedded in the word <i>Nicolaitan.</i> In the original language, <i>Nicolaitan</i> is <i>nikolaos.</i> Its root <i>nikos</i> means to subjugate. <i>Laos,</i> of course, means people. <i>Nicolaitan,</i> therefore, means those who subjugate the people. In Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord specifically pointed out His rejection and hatred of both <i>Laodikeia</i> and <i>Nikolaos.</i> It is wrong to resort to pressure and subjugation in the church services. It is equally wrong to resort to the principle of the majority. According to the opinion of the majority, Christ was condemned and crucified (Matt. 27:21-23). It is wrong for church affairs to be determined by one person or a few persons. In the Catholic Church, the pope decides everything by himself in the Vatican. This is the work of the Nicolaitans.</p>
