<P>As a result of my preaching and teaching, a number of people gave up their denominations and came together to meet with me. This bothered many of the pastors and elders of the denominations in Chefoo, especially since I grew up in that city and we knew one another. One day some leading ones from the denominations in Chefoo joined together and invited me to eat with them. After they finished talking to me about what bothered them, I presented the truth concerning the church to them. I asked them, "Would you please tell me how many Christs and how many churches there are in this universe?" They all said, "One." Then I said, "There is just one church, but each of you represents one denomination, so seven denominations are represented here. Are you seven denominations, one church?" Of course, they were not one church. I pointed out to them that in 1 Corinthians Paul rebuked the Corinthians for saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (1:12). Paul said, "Is Christ divided?" (v. 13). I then asked these few leading ones, "If Paul were here today, would he not rebuke you for meeting in division?" They answered, "Yes."</P><P>Then I said, "All of you know me. I grew up among you. I was working in this city for seven and a half years. But then the Lord touched me to give up my job and serve Him with all of my time. I do not have any organization or person supporting me. I am doing this because I love the Lord. I have given up everything for Him. You all know this." I asked them, "Don't you believe I will preach the Lord Jesus to many people and that my preaching will have some result?" Then I asked them, "Where should I put these ones who are saved through my preaching? Should I put them into your denominations?" Then they said, "No, you should not put them into any denomination." Then I asked where I should put them, and they could not answer.</P><P>They had told me earlier that I should not open a building for people to come together to meet with me. Instead, they wanted me to rotate among their denominations and preach there. I told them that I could not accept this, because they were not the church. They were the denominations, and every denomination is a division. To meet in denominations is to divide the church, which is the unique Body of Christ. I asked them how I could put the result, the fruit, I reaped from my preaching into the denominations, into the divisions. I said that this was why I was forced to open up a meeting place. Then I said, "Have you noticed that on our meeting place, we do not have a signboard telling people what kind of church we are. But all of you have a signboard declaring to people what denomination you are. We do not have such a signboard because we do not like to be denominated. Once we are denominated, we become a division, and division in the Body of Christ is abominable in the eyes of the Lord." They were all silenced.</P><P>Then I said, "I am willing to close the door to our meeting place, if you will do one thing." I said, "Please go back to your places and take off the signboards which designate your denomination. Then let us all come together to be the one church in Chefoo. If you promise to do this, I will go back directly to close the door of our meeting hall." Then they said that they surely could not do this. I responded, "Sirs, since you cannot do this, I have to meet in our meeting place. I presented to you my willingness to close the door to our meeting place, but you are not willing to take off your signboards to deny every denomination and recognize one church. You are meeting in division, but we are meeting in oneness as the church." Soon after my meeting with these leading ones, we increased even more. I hope this fellowship will help us to answer those who would ask us why we say that we are the church. Just as the moon cannot be designated, the church cannot be designated, and thus denominated.</P>
