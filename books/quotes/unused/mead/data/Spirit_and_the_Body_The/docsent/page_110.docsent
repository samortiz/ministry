   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE A FEW CRUCIAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to cover a number of miscellaneous matters pertaining to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first concerns doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TWO CLASSES OF DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Doctrine is not necessarily a negative thing, for the Bible is composed of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we need to differentiate between the two classifications of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first class contains those doctrines that are not divisive, whereas the second class includes the doctrines that are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Certain doctrines, those which constitute our faith, are basic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, there are many other doctrines that are not basic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE COMMON FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our faith is constituted with certain basic doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, we all must believe that God is one yet triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anyone who does not believe that God is uniquely one yet triune is in error.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This doctrine of God is not divisive; rather, it is basic, and all Christians must believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, we all must believe that our God became incarnated in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the Son of God became incarnated as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Anyone who does not believe this cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, we all must believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God incarnated as a man, lived on earth and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually, and today He is our Savior, our Lord in resurrection, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we believe in Him, our sins are forgiven, He comes into us as our life, and we are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the regenerated ones are the unique church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In whatever locality they reside, they are the local expression of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, all the saints in the churches are waiting for the Lord Jesus to come back to receive them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the basic doctrines, the doctrines that constitute the saving faith, the doctrines we must believe in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because every sound, genuine believer holds these basic doctrines, they are called the common faith Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is hardly any argument among saints regarding them.</S>
