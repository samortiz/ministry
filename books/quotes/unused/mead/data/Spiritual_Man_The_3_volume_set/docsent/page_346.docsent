   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is very difficult when the believer's heart is far apart from God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's purpose is to have the believer lose his self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, He allows him to become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the more he becomes sick, the more he loves himself, and the weaker he becomes, the more he cares for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's goal is that he would forget about himself, but he keeps thinking about his own sickness, the pain in his body, the way to be healed, and whether or not his sickness is getting better.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All his thoughts are centered around himself!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He pays attention to his food and how he should refrain from this and avoid taking that!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he feels a little uncomfortable, he becomes terribly upset!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He pays considerable attention to his own warmth and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he has a little temperature, catches a little cold, or loses a night of sleep, he becomes very uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that all these are fatal to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is very sensitive about how others treat him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is very sensitive about how often people think of him, care for him, and come to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He spends a great amount of time thinking about his own body and its condition, and not the Lord and what He wants to accomplish in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Indeed, many believers are totally "obsessed" with their own self during their sickness!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We usually are not very aware of how much we love ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when we are sick, we realize that we love ourselves very much!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is this what God delights in?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wants us to realize that self-love damages us more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He also wants us to know that we love ourselves immensely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the midst of a sickness, He wants us to learn not to look at our symptoms and care for our pain, but to look at Him wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wants us to commit our body completely into His hand and let Him care for it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time a bad symptom is discovered, it should always warn us not to think of the body anymore, but to wholly think of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, because of self-love, the believer seeks for healing as soon as he becomes sick.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It never occurs to him that he should first remove the evil deed in his heart before asking for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He only sees the hope of being healed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will not inquire as to why God allowed the sickness to come upon his body, what he needs to repent of, what he needs to eliminate, or what he must reject so that he does not waste God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He cares for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cannot afford to get weak and longs to be strong immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, he seeks for ways to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He inquires of man and begs God, hoping to have an early recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Under this condition, God will never reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although many times we see this kind of believer momentarily healed, the healing does not last; after a while, the old sickness recurs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can long-term healing be possible when the root of the sickness is not removed?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sickness is God's way of speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not intend that we frantically look for healing but that we obey and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very pitiful that the believer does not say to the Lord, "Speak, for Thy servant heareth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, he hopes to obtain a speedy recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our goal is to be delivered from pain and weakness immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hastily we try our best to seek for the best medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems as if sickness forces us to invent all kinds of remedies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every single symptom scares us and wrecks our brain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God seems to be far away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We forget our spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can only think of our suffering and remedy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the sickness is prolonged, we will misperceive the Father's love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the medicine works smoothly, we will praise God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we should ask if it is indeed the leading of the Holy Spirit that we be wholly delivered from pain?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Will such an exercise of fleshly strength glorify God?</S>
