   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROUND NOT DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another problem regarding divisions concerns those who only care for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the meetings of the local church are not so spiritual, they will not go along.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They will separate themselves to meet in a more spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not care for the unique ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It may be that they are not clear that the ground of the church does not depend upon the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The condition may fluctuate, but the ground, the standing, never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we may be very spiritual, but after two months we may not be so spiritual; and after two years, we may be worse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if today we are weak, can you say that after two years we will not be strong?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This, however, is a matter of condition, which easily fluctuates; but the standing of the ground can never change.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose we have a family called the Smiths.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their standing as the Smith family is something which can never be altered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the condition of the Smith family may be good today and bad tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why should the members of the Smith family stay together as a family?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Simply because they are one family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As one family, regardless of how good or bad it is, it is still the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is their standing, their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose one of the members of the Smith family thinks that his family is quite poor; so he goes to another family, and that family is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But after two years that family becomes much poorer than the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then what shall he do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problem today is that Christians have no standing, no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They only look at the spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"This group is more spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would like to be with them."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after two years I may be very unhappy with them; so I go to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I am such a person, this means I have no standing, no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am always seeking a place according to the spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The condition fluctuates, but the ground remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who can change the site of a building?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The building may be poor today, but after a few months greatly improved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In three months, the building may change in its condition, but the site, the ground, is forever the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is only by the unique ground of locality that the church can be kept one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without this ground, she will be spontaneously divided.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is one; so the expression of the church must also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how big or how small a city may be, the church must be uniquely one in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wherever we are, we are one, and wherever we go, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I go to San Francisco, I must go to the church in San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I go to London, I must go to the church in London.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I come to Los Angeles, I must come to the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is the same in boundary as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How many churches should there be in San Francisco?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There should be only one, because in every city the expression of the church must be uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we go to San Francisco, we must find where the church is and go to it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is just like going to Tokyo or London to find the American consulate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The American consulate is our consulate because we are citizens of America.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need not ask to which American consulate we must go.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need only ask as Americans citizens, "Where is my consulate?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the same when we as Christians go to San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As Christians, we should ask, "Where is the church?" and go to it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in fact, sometimes it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For instance a brother finds the church in San Francisco and goes to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First he looks at the brothers and then at the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then he sees the way they have their meeting and attempts to discern how spiritual they are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After this, he returns home to consider the whole situation and eventually decides that he will not go there anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He stays home to pray: "Lord, You know that I love You, and You know my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>O Lord, You know how much I seek after Thee, and You know the situation in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, You know how I cannot go along with that kind of people."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more he prays, the more he is clear that he must start a meeting in his home, intending that it will be a more spiritual meeting than the church meeting he attended.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, he begins to meet with others in his home with a very pure intention.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They meet in the name of the Lord, and they can even give testimony of how the Lord has heard their prayers and is guiding them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have even brought some people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But regardless of how pure, how spiritual, and how full of Christ his group is, it is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And regardless of how poor and how weak and how short of Christ the church in San Francisco is, that is the unique church according to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one has the right to start another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the only way for us to keep the unity and the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can never keep the oneness of the church by the spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let me illustrate in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Suppose two Americans go to Tokyo and visit the American consulate.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But from the American consulate they receive very poor service.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These two are offended by such a poor consulate in Tokyo; therefore, one of them suggests that they start another American consulate in their home there.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They will give the best service, they say.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Later another American comes to Tokyo and goes to the American consulate, and he also is offended by the poor service.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then he meets the two Americans who started another consulate in their home, and they ask him to come and see how good their American consulate is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, he goes to their house, and finds that their American consulate just fits his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You may think that this is ridiculous, but have you ever realized that this is exactly the situation of today's Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everyone is so free to start another "church" at any time and any place.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But is it the proper church?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It may be more spiritual, but the ground is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We know that at least 13 million Hebrew people exist on the earth today, but only about two million have gone back to the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In New York City alone there are at least three million Hebrews now.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Are not all these just as much Hebrews as those in the Holy Land?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Surely they are!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But who constitutes the Nation of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Only those who are on the ground of the Nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even though the number of Hebrews in New York is larger, they are still not the Nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They are Hebrews, but they are not the Nation of Israel, because they are not on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Only those who have gone back and are standing there in the Holy Land are the Nation of Israel, because they are on the proper ground of their nation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Without the Holy Land, how could the people of Israel be a nation?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They simply would not have the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The same is true with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Without the proper and unique ground, how can we practice the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, in order to practice the church life, we must have the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Hebrews who live in New York may be fine people, very religious and high class people.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>On the other hand, those who have returned to the Holy Land may be poor and of a lower class.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But if you wanted to be in the Nation of Israel, would you remain in New York or return to the Holy Land?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Of course, you would go to the country of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Those Hebrews who have returned to the right ground may not be so fine and so well cultured as those in New York, but I have full assurance that only with those who have gone to the Holy Land is it possible for the Lord's purpose to be fulfilled for the Hebrew nation.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Regardless of how good those in New York are, they can never fulfill the Lord's purpose, for they are not on the ground of their nation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Oh, how we need to see the importance of the ground!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is only by the ground that the unity and the oneness of the church can be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>And it is only by the ground that we can learn the lessons we need in order to experience the reality and practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Without the ground, it is impossible to have the proper church life.</S>
