   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEVELOPING CHARACTER BY CULTIVATING PROPER HABITS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Young people should try their best to pick up good habits.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One such habit is making your bed in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I want to find out about a young man's character, the first thing I would look at is his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a small thing, but what we are is more easily expressed in small things than in big things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In big things, we can perform or act as actors, but in small things, we are really genuine, expressing what we really are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I recommend the book Character to you that it may be a help in developing your character.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first three points of character presented in this book are genuineness, exactness, and strictness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be genuine is to be what you are without any pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be exact is to be accurate, without understatement or exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In married life, many separations and divorces are due to carelessness and inaccuracies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church life, inaccuracies can cause a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must practice to build up our character by learning to be genuine, exact, and strict.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By practicing, we build up a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, some only dust the middle of a piece of furniture, neglecting the edges.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But others dust the entire piece of furniture thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is by habit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must build up a habit of doing things thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also should practice to be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person who does not practice to be accurate cannot rightly understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you practice to be accurate, when you read the Bible, you will read it accurately, because this is your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, 1 Corinthians 14:23, a verse which is very familiar to us, says, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first two words are neglected by most readers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word "therefore" simply indicates a continuation of the foregoing verse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the word "if" indicates a great deal more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church comes together regularly, there is no need to say, "If the church comes together."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"If" indicates that the whole church does not come together regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our practice corresponds to this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament way of practicing the church meetings was to mainly meet in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes, the whole church came together, so "if" is used.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is an example of accuracy and strictness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If by practice you have been built up as a strict and accurate person, you will pay attention to each word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Question: Should we use our natural effort to build up our character?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Answer: No, we should not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As Christians seeking after the Lord, we do not need to do anything by our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should always do things first by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason that the Bible charges us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should praise the Lord and tell Him that we are weak and unable to do what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, after some prayer, we should exercise to trust in the Lord and look unto Him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are concerned about our character, we should pray, trust in the Lord, and look unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We look unto Him to help us build up our character and to rescue us from our old habit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what is meant by endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Colossians 1:29, Paul said that he struggled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems that it is we who are struggling, but actually, we trust the Lord to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we say that we must endeavor to do things, this does not mean that we do things with our own effort like Olympic athletes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we endeavor, struggle, and even fight, not by ourselves, but through prayer, trusting in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Question: Can outward rules and regulations like those in this training help us to develop character?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These all seem to be outward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But to pray, trusting the Lord, looking to Him, seems to be more inward.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Are both useful?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Answer: It is difficult to say that looking to the Lord is only inward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To look unto the Lord or to trust in the Lord is both inward and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do have an attitude and we also hold such a spirit that we are looking unto Him, trusting Him to do things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even this is a kind of character, a good Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is something every seeking Christian should have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All day long we should have an attitude that we are looking to the Lord, trusting in Him, and praying to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are such persons, our colleagues or co-workers who are with us daily and weekly will notice that we are people who trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is our cooperation with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are linked to Him, joined to Him, as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So, we must live such a life, doing everything by trusting in Him through prayer.</S>
