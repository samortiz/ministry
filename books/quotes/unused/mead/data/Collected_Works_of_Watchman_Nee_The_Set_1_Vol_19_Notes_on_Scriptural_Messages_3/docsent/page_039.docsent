   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Third Proof</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 28:20 says, "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please note that it is the end of the age, not the end of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord said, "I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let me ask you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the whole church is raptured before the tribulation, then would the length of the time for the Lord to be with the church be at least three and a half years shorter?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, I am not saying that this is a big proof, but I am saying that this is a small proof.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 2:34-35 says, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord will wait until the foes of Christ become the footstool of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that this is at the end of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God will destroy those Gentiles who have destroyed the world and will give the authority to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the enemies will become Christ's footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God says, "Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But our friends say that Christ has left the Father's throne even before God has made His enemies His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems as if they are saying that Christ cannot wait.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This point is also a small clue.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, no one who studies Revelation carefully can ever say that Christ would leave the throne and come to the air before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no such record in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have never seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If indeed Christ comes to the air before the tribulation, how could Revelation forget to record this matter which is the center of the prophecy?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 14:1-5 speaks of the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verses 6 through 13 speak of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 14 through 15 speak of Christ's coming to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, Christ's coming to the air to receive the saints takes place after Revelation 6 12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this we can see that the rapture of the saints occurs after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THAT THE ENTIRE CHURCH WILL PASS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Does this mean that the entire church will pass through the tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the Bible, there is no mention that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One brother received a letter from a friend which said that whoever believes that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation has someone else reading the Bible for him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that he believes whatever others say without investigating it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible does not say that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Does the Bible say that the entire church will be raptured after the tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No, it does not say that either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible does say that among the ones who have been saved and born again, a small number will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the majority will be raptured after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who say that the entire church will be raptured after the tribulation have the following fundamental errors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. Watching and Waiting Becoming Meaningless</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who hold the concept that the entire church will pass through the tribulation cannot watch and be prepared for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since they know that before the rapture there must be three and a half years of tribulation, there is no need for them to be prepared or to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, since they know they have to wait three and a half years before Christ would come, it is not too late to delay watching until even three or five months before the end of the three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the Bible tells us to watch always, to pray unceasingly, and to be ready for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the entire church will pass through the tribulation, one could begin to get ready a few days before the end of the three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>B. Not Waiting for the Lord but for the Antichrist</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the entire church passes through the tribulation, our living on the earth will not be filled with waiting for Christ but for Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Daily we will only need to look and see if Antichrist has come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, our eyes will be on the surroundings instead of looking above.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is contrary to the teaching of the Bible, for the Bible does not tell us to wait for Antichrist, but to wait for the Lord.</S>
