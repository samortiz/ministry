   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR SYMBOLS 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover more symbols of the believers: threshing oxen, runners in a race and contenders in a game, workman in carpentry, nursing mother, father, wise master builder, ambassadors, stewards, captives of Christ in His triumphal procession, and incense-bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>T. THRESHING OXEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We come now to another unusual symbol of the believers threshing oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 9:9 and 10a the believers are likened to laboring oxen that thresh the harvest: "In the law of Moses it is written: You shall not muzzle a threshing ox.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is it for the oxen that God cares?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or does He say it assuredly for our sake?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For our sake."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here Paul quotes the Old Testament in a wonderful way and applies it to the present situation, in particular, to the situation of those who labor in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Timothy 5:18 Paul again quotes Deuteronomy 25:4, saying, "You shall not muzzle a threshing ox."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the context, those who labor in word and teaching v. 17 may be fully occupied, devoting all their time to this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the church and the saints should care for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, in verse 18 Paul refers to what the Scripture says about not muzzling a threshing ox.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Laboring with Their Mouth Not Muzzled</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Corinthians 9:9 Paul likened himself to an ox laboring for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Corinthians wanted to muzzle him; that is, they wanted him to work without being fed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason Paul pointed out that while threshing oxen are laboring to thresh the harvest, their mouths should not be muzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eating What Is under Their Threshing</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of being muzzled, threshing oxen should eat what is under their threshing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that while they are laboring to thresh the harvest, they should be free to eat what they are threshing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>U. RUNNERS IN A RACE AND CONTENDERS IN A GAME</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Do you not know that those who run in a race-course all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So run, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible" 1 Cor 9:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These verses reveal that the believers are runners in a race and contenders in a game.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Christian life is a race that we must run successfully and a game in which we must contend.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The prize is a reward as an incentive; to "lay hold" is to obtain the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we consider verse 24 in relation to verse 23, we shall see that to run in a race-course is to labor, but to receive the prize is to have enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we preach the gospel today, we are running the course.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But to receive a reward, a prize, at the coming of the Lord Jesus is to have a particular enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 9:17 Paul speaks of a reward, and in Acts 20:24 he refers to the course: "I consider my life of no account as if it were precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify the gospel of the grace of God."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul regarded his preaching of the gospel as the running of the Christian race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 9:24 indicates that all believers are running a race.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul exhorts us to run so that we may obtain, lay hold of, the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 9 reveals that the Christian course involves the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To preach the gospel is to dispense Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By dispensing Christ into those who are receptive to our preaching we run the Christian course.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, because many believers today are not running the race, we need Paul's word, "So run, that you may lay hold."</S>
