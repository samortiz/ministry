In His economy as a plan, an arrangement, God decided to produce an organic Body to be His organism in life for His increase and expression
When He was resurrected, He brought the God-created, fallen, and then redeemed man into God, thus uplifting the redeemed man
In resurrection His humanity was uplifted into His divinity, and He was born in His humanity to be God's firstborn Son
Resurrection was a great delivery in which God's firstborn Son and the millions of God's many sons were delivered in one birth
At the same time we, the God-chosen and Christ-redeemed people, were all born with Him in that resurrection to be God's many sons
He became the life-giving Spirit that He might enter into those redeemed by Christ and regenerate them to make them the children of God
Many of those who have been brought into the recovery love the local church to the uttermost, and they stress the local church very much
Some may say that since the church is the Body of Christ and since we are in the church, we should also be in the Body
We need to be in the local churches so that we can be ushered, or brought, into the reality of the Body of Christ
Bro Nee made the local churches so clear and precious to us who were attracted by the Lord to follow Him according to His holy Scriptures
In Brother Nee's speaking to us concerning the Body of Christ, it was as if he were playing the piano to a group of cows
We do not want to be skating on the surface; we desire to go down to the bottom to see You, to see Your heart, to see what You want today
Even among us who are in the recovery, not many have the realization that we need the blending, and we need it desperately
For the long run there was the need for the opening up of the holy Word so that people could see the life in this book
To open up the entire Bible from the first page to the last is needed, but what is the central matter in the Holy Bible?
Although we may have a good church life among us there is almost no realization no practicality no actuality and no reality of the Body life
The regular procedures of the church work in the Lord's recovery today consist of four steps: begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building
We should not pay so much attention to the mere establishing of the churches and the arranging of many outward things
The churches set up around the globe are a physical frame, but among the churches there may be no reality of the Body of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 10:17 Paul said, 'Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread'
Paul's thought of the church being one bread was not his own invention; rather, it was taken from the Old Testament
Later in 1 Corinthians, in 12:24, Paul wrote, 'But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked'
In Philippians 3:10 Paul said that we all need to be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection
We all need to ask ourselves whether the coordination among us is by the power of Christ's resurrection or merely by our natural man
Anything that is carried out even scripturally but in the natural life is not the reality of the Body of Christ
It is common today that in the local churches what we can see is mostly the 'church' in its meetings, activities, works, and services
Lord, we trust in Your mighty name and we trust in Your prevailing blood against the enemy, against the evil one
Is it possible that the shoulder is one autonomy, the nose is another autonomy, and the two feet are two other autonomies?
These seven lampstands are all identical in nature, in essence, in size, in type, in appearance, in color, and in function
On the one hand, it does have a frame, a body, but this frame is not the nature, the essence, or the element of the church
The Body of Christ is composed first of the redeemed ones who were born by the Spirit to be the children of the Father
Regardless of how much divine life and divine nature we have to be the same as God, we do not have the Godhead
We can see the believers because the holy city bears the names of the twelve apostles representing all the New Testament believers
Even the Old Testament people such as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, and all the prophets were blended together
1 Timothy 1:4, Ephesians 1:10, and Ephesians 3:9 all use the word economy, a translation of the Greek word oikonomia
In John 14:23 the Lord said, 'If anyone loves Me My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
You and I, the old man, the natural man, have been terminated on the cross, crucified by the Lord in His death
We should be the mass production of that model the God-men who have both the human life uplifted in Christs resurrection and the divine life
Brother Nee ministered on the Body of Christ again and again, but eventually turmoil arose that forced him to stop his ministry
Yes, Brother Nee did minister on the local churches, but he went on from the local churches to the Body of Christ
For thirty-three and a half years, this God-man, Jesus, was a genuine man, but He lived not by man's life but by God's life
God's life with all its attributes was lived within this God-man Jesus and expressed as this God-man's virtues
All of them have been nourished, sanctified, transformed, and perfected not just to be matured Christians, but to be God-men
If among us there is, if not in full at least in part, such a living, the reality of the Body of Christ is among us
No doubt, this means that when the Spirit of reality comes, the Lord Himself would dwell in us in order to live in us
The eternal God, after His creation and after passing through the necessary processes, eventually became the Spirit of reality
For us to reach the high peak of Gods economy that is the reality of the Body of Christ we must firstly see this divine indwelling within us
While He dwells in us, He builds Himself as the very element into our being to build up a kind of wonderful constitution for Him to dwell in
He told David that He would build Himself into David to be his seed and this seed eventually would be born to be the Son of God
Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God with humanity uplifted to the divine standard in and by His resurrection
The Lord makes an abode with us in this age, the age of the church, for God to build up a house for Himself and for us as well
The Spirit as the pneumatic Christ, the processed and consummated Triune God, is building Himself into us and building us into Him
We need to live a life with Christ who lives in us, to have a mutual abiding, a mutual building, a mutual living
He also said that he was pursuing after Christ, desiring to be conformed to His death by realizing the power of His resurrection
Christ's death is a mold, and my living is a piece of dough put into the mold to be conformed to the image of the mold
Paul said that such a person has his being in this marvelous Spirit and does everything according to such a Spirit
We need to check whether or not we are doing everything in the Spirit and having our being according to such a Spirit
Today in the church age, the God-men who were perfected and matured are Zion, the overcomers, the vital groups within the churches
God's redeemed people have become absolutely the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance, but not in His Godhead
All of God's redeemed people will eventually become gods as the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance but not in the Godhead
The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God
We should not have the attitude that we are safe in the Lord because we have sacrificed our future and do not love the world
In this humanity, the glory of God will be expressed, manifested, to the uttermost, full of brightness, full of splendor, and full of glory
It is more than evident that Jerusalem is here as a big realm of Christians, but where is Zion, the overcomers?
