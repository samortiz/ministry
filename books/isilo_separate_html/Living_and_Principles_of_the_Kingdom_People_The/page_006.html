DEPENDING ON GAINING GOD TO LIVE GOD OUT</h2>
<p>The Lord spoke concerning nine conditions of the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens from the inside to the outside. The walk of every genuine and truthful believer is not merely an outward activity; it involves his inward nature and character. The kind of person he is determines the kind of living he has.</p>
<p>The human spirit is man&rsquo;s deepest part, followed by his heart. The deepest and most important two parts of man are the spirit and the heart. These parts represent him. Therefore, in Matthew 5 through 7 the Lord began by speaking of the spirit. The first condition is related to the spirit, and the sixth condition is related to the heart. Thus, a person in the kingdom of the heavens needs to deal with his spirit and his heart.</p>
<p>Within man the spirit has the highest ability, because man can contact God with his spirit. This is the highest ability. Seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, smelling with the nose, eating and drinking with the mouth, and touching with the hands are all human abilities, but they are low. Only the ability of the spirit is high, because we can contact, touch, and gain God, who is Spirit, with our spirit.</p>
<p>The human heart is an organ with emotions. Man&rsquo;s likes and inclinations are related to his heart. Man can touch and gain God with his spirit, but if his heart does not love God or is not inclined toward God, his spirit cannot contact God. Conversely, man&rsquo;s heart may love God and be inclined toward God, but if he is not poor in spirit, he will not be able to contact or gain God. Therefore, living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens depends on our spirit and our heart. We contact God with our spirit, but our heart enables our spirit to contact God. Our spirit and our heart are indispensable. Hence, when the Lord spoke on the inner condition of the kingdom people, He began with the spirit and then spoke of the heart.</p>
<p>There are six inner conditions of the kingdom people. The first is being poor in spirit (5:3); the sixth is being pure in heart (v. 8). Those who have a normal spirit and heart have a normal relationship with God, because they desire God when they are poor in spirit, and they see God when they are pure in heart. To see is to gain; thus, in the sixth condition man gains God. When someone gains God within, he can live out the kingdom of the heavens; his living becomes noble, extraordinary, and excelling, and because he has gained God, he is filled with God, and he lives like a son of God.</p>
<p>A living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is not based on human effort. Such a living is to live God out first by being poor in spirit and pure in heart and then by gaining God and being filled with Him. The last three conditions concern the living of the kingdom people. The first condition in this group says that those who live out the kingdom life are sons of God (v. 9). Only those who live out the life of God the Father can be called sons of God, for only sons can live out the life of their father.</p>
<p>A living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens does not speak of man&rsquo;s ability but of God&rsquo;s ability. Such a life is impossible with man but possible with God (cf. 19:26; Mark 10:27). Such a living is Emmanuel being lived out of man (Matt. 1:21-23). Only by living out the Father&rsquo;s life can we be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (5:48). In other words, the living of the kingdom of the heavens is a matter of God being mingled with man. If we accept God&rsquo;s rule, are under His authority, and live in the reality of the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens, God&rsquo;s life will mingle freely with us and live out an extraordinary life through us. This is the living of the kingdom people.</p>
<p>What is commonly called the eight Beatitudes by Christians does not touch the spiritual reality of the Lord&rsquo;s word. This section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching begins with the spirit and continues to the heart. The Lord teaches that man&rsquo;s spirit must be poor and thirsty for God and that man&rsquo;s heart must be pure and seeking God. When man&rsquo;s spirit and heart take God as the object, man gains God within and lets God live out an extraordinary life through him. Those with such a living are the kingdom people. This is the living of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO SIDES OF THE LIVING OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h2>
<p>This section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching reveals two sides of the living of the kingdom people. One side is our relationship with others, and the other side is our attitude toward ourselves. Our relationship with others is centered on peace. Someone who lives in the kingdom of the heavens makes peace with others; no matter who he is with, there is only peace. We must remember that peace is the highest requirement.</p>
<p>Most believers think that it is quite high to treat others with love. The requirement of love is not as high as the requirement of peace. Someone may not have peace when he treats others with love, but he must have love in order to be at peace with others. In the church it seems as though the more love there is, the more there are strife and opinions. This is because people have love, but their flesh is not broken; they are not under the ruling of the heavens, and there is disharmony among the saints. Some saints quarrel and report it to the responsible brothers; other saints are not on speaking terms. Two sisters might be best friends and love each other very much, but they can disagree over some things and even quarrel. It is not enough to merely have love.</p>
<p>The Lord is very wise. In Matthew 5 He did not teach concerning love but concerning peace, for the demand of making peace with others is higher than that of showing love to others. Love does not require our flesh to be dealt with, but making peace requires our flesh to be dealt with and also requires that we be under the rule of the heavens and restricted by the heavens.</p>
<p>We should not think that the Lord was being overly simple in speaking of the living of the kingdom people. The Lord seemed to speak only of peace, but peace covers many matters. The Lord did not mention other matters, because it was sufficient to mention this one central and crucial matter. If we can take care of peace, every other matter will be taken care of properly. It is not sufficient to merely be humble or loving; we must have peace with others.</p>
<p>The peacemakers shall be called the sons of God because the work that the Lord Jesus as the Son of God manifested on the earth is centered on peace (v. 9). Even His death on the cross is for making peace (Eph. 2:15-16; Col. 1:20). Therefore, the living of the kingdom people should be with peace toward men. This requires dealings related to our self and our flesh. It also requires that our whole being be ruled and restricted by the heavens.</p>
<p>The relationship that others have toward us is centered on persecution and evil speaking. The evil that people can do to us is to persecute us and speak evil of us (Matt. 5:10-11). If we can accept persecution and endure evil speaking, there is nothing more that men can do to us. Moreover, people persecute us because we seek righteousness, not because we are at fault. People speak evilly of us because we preach the gospel and testify of the Lord&rsquo;s name, not because we have done evil. To stand before persecutions and evil speakings means that no matter how people treat us&mdash;well or ill, with understanding or with misunderstanding&mdash;there is nothing that we cannot withstand. We are ready to take any treatment from any person.</p>
<p>When the kingdom people are peacemakers and withstand persecution and evil speaking, they are not only blameless in their living but also lack blemishes. Peace is the center and the criterion in their dealing with people, and the kingdom people receive persecution and evil speaking from others because they seek righteousness and testify of the Lord&rsquo;s name. There is no room to preserve the self and no possibility for the flesh to exist. Their whole being is under the rule of the heavens, and they are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
