   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. IN DYING WITH ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We reign in life first in dying with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dying with Adam is not a doctrine; rather, it is a matter of our being in an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Terminated</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>with Adam in Our Co-death with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our natural life needs to be terminated with Adam in our co-death with Christ Rom 6:3, 4a, 5a, 6-8a; Gal 2:20a; Eph 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were created by God in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, due to Adam s fall, our life became the natural life of the old creation in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are two main elements in our natural life of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first element is sin and the second is death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 5 7 shows us that in Adam there are only sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through one man, Adam, sin entered into the world, and through sin, death 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, sin reigned in us through death v. 21a; 6:12 , and death reigned over us through the offense of the one, Adam 5:17a, 14 . Therefore, in Adam we did not reign in life; rather, we were under the ruling of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, as the last Adam, Christ died an all-inclusive death on the cross, and through such a death He brought everything of the adamic life to the cross and had a great ending there 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we be delivered out of the reigning of sin and death?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not by our struggling and striving; rather, it is through the all-inclusive death of Christ that we allow the life of Christ to reign in us instead of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, it is no longer sin and death that reign in us; rather, it is grace and life that reign in us 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Annihilated</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>with Adam in Our Co-death with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our natural life needs to be annihilated, completely destroyed, put out of existence, with Adam in our co-death with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our baptism we have been buried with Christ into His death, and thereby the natural life of our old man in Adam has been annihilated 6:3-4a .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN LIVING WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We reign in life not only in our dying with Adam but also in our living with Christ Rom 6:4b, 5b, 8b; Gal 2:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 6:8 says, Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows our organic union with Christ in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such an organic union is best illustrated in grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two separate branches are made one by grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were grafted with Christ and have grown together with Him in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Raised</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>with Christ in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our natural life needs to be raised with Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although our natural life was defiled by sin and death through the fall, we have received the resurrection life of Christ into us through our death and resurrection with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This resurrection life of Christ is the life-giving Spirit, who enlivens us from within that we may be raised with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In resurrection our God-created faculties are restored; moreover, they are enriched with, uplifted by, and saturated with Christ s resurrection life for us to experience and enjoy all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Renewed</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>with Christ in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our natural life needs to be renewed with Christ in His resurrection Eph 4:23-24; 2 Cor 4:16; 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our natural life belongs to the realm of the old creation, the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In baptism we put off our old man; moreover, our old man was crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our practical experience, however, we need to allow the Spirit, who indwells our regenerated spirit, to spread to our mind so that in such a mingled spirit we may be nourished and renewed by the fresh supply of the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
