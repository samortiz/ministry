   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30; 12:3; 1:2, 9, 22-23 EATING JESUS BEING THE BASIC CONCEPT IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen in previous chapters, from the beginning to the end of the Bible the main, central, and basic concept of God is that we must eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life, indicating that man should eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus came, He presented Himself to us as the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" v. 57 . This word is very strong, definite, and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, most of us never heard a message in Christianity which told us that we need to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we should not trust the teachings in Christianity that miss the basic concept in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The matter of eating is mentioned again and again in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing is more basic than eating.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the Passover the people ate the meat of the lamb and the unleavened bread Exo 12:3, 8, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the wilderness the people ate manna day by day 16:4, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then at the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation, the tree of life is mentioned again: "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God" Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also Revelation 22:14 says, "Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For eternity our portion is to eat Jesus as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BASIC CONCEPT OF 1 CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to understand any verse of the Bible we must always take care of its context.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The context includes both the chapter as well as the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we will present the basic concept of the book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fundamentalists and the Pentecostals have misused or overemphasized certain verses in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is dreadful to misuse the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Still, I have no intention to argue with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, my burden from the Lord is to show His people the proper concept in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Plymouth Brethren, who published a number of books on 1 Corinthians, mainly pointed out the teachings used to solve some of the problems of the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These problems include marriage, the Lord's table, head covering, and lawsuits between brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Brethren emphasized the teachings in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They used verse 26 of chapter fourteen, for example, to show in a doctrinal way how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In contrast to the Brethren, the Pentecostals mainly emphasize chapter twelve and other verses of chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must come back to the pure Word according to the whole context and full scope of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to find a street in a city, you have to look at the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you will know which direction to take in order to find a certain street.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we look into the entire scope of 1 Corinthians, we will know where chapters twelve and fourteen stand, and we will also know how the problems mentioned in 1 Corinthians can be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PAUL'S GREETING TO THE CHURCH OF GOD IN CORINTH</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each book of the Bible has its particular beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis begins with, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew begins with "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John begins with, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians begins in a special way: "Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours" 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This greeting is unique among all the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I had been Paul, I might have been very simple, addressing my letter with, "To the brothers and sisters in Corinth" or "To the Corinthian believers."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul's address, however, is very complicated, having at least seven points.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First he says, "to the church"; second, "of God"; third, "which is in Corinth"; fourth, "to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus"; fifth, "the called saints"; sixth, "with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ"; and seventh, "who is theirs and ours."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need at least one message for each of these seven points.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The phrase which is in Corinth is a special phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It does not say that the church is in the heavens or in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It says that the church is in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that the church is something in a locality; in Corinth there is a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the meaning of the phrase sanctified in Christ Jesus, and what is the meaning of called saints?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not called to be saints, as the King James Version says.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are already called, not as sinners, publicans, teachers, or scholars, but as saints.</S>
