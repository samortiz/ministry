First, Christ's Person and His redemptive work were fully vindicated and accepted by God. Second, Christ won a full victory over death, Hades, Satan, and the world. Let us see four more aspects of His wonderful resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE GLORIFICATION OF CHRIST'S DIVINE LIFE</H2><P>When Christ was on earth, He was God concealed within a physical body. Inwardly there was God, but outwardly there was the flesh. When others looked at Christ, they could not see anything special about this One (Mark 6:3; John 10:33). But through Christ's death and resurrection, the God who was concealed within Him was released and made known. This display is what we call Christ's glorification. This is what He was praying for just before His death when He said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (John 17:1).</P><P>Suppose we have a flower seed. Although much beauty is in the life of that seed, how can that beauty be manifested? The seed has to die. If the seed falls into the earth, dies, and grows up, the full beauty within it will be manifested. That is its glory, the glorification of the life in the seed. Likewise, at one time God was confined within the flesh of the Lord. The Lord had to die so that God within Him might be released, manifested, and glorified in resurrection.</P><P>When Christ was in the flesh during His thirty-three and a half years on the earth, He was exactly like the flower seed. Although the Son of God was in Him, no one could recognize this easily. By being sown into death and growing up in resurrection, He blossomed&#151;that is, the divine life within Him was fully displayed, glorified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE DESIGNATION OF CHRIST'S HUMANITY</H2><P>Romans 1:3 and 4 say: "Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, Who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God..out of the resurrection of the dead." In resurrection, Christ was designated the Son of God in His humanity. Before His incarnation, Christ, as a divine Person, was already the Son of God (John 1:18). He was the Son of God before His incarnation, and even Romans 8:3 says, "God sending His own Son." Since Christ was already the Son of God, why did He need to be designated the Son of God through resurrection? Because by incarnation He had put on the flesh, the human nature that had nothing to do with divinity. As a divine Person, Christ was the Son of God before His incarnation; but that part of Him which was Jesus with the flesh, born of Mary, was not the Son of God. That part of Him was human. By His resurrection, Christ has sanctified and uplifted His human nature, His humanity; He was designated out of this resurrection as the Son of God with this human nature. So, in this sense, the Bible says that He was begotten the Son of God in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5).</P><P>In His resurrection, Christ is still a man; as such He has been designated the Son of God. This is not an insignificant matter. The incarnation brought God into man, but the resurrection brought man into God. Because of the process Christ went through, a man has been brought into the Godhead. Yes, there is now a man in the Godhead! Christ in His human nature has been designated the Son of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 2: The Triune God-The Triune God and the Person and Work of Christ &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
