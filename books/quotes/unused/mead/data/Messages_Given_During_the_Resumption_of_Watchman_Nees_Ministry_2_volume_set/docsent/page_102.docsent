   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Being Interested in Interfering with Others,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Always Seeking Help from Others</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A minister cannot speak in a loose way, nor can he demand that others submit to him all the time without himself being first dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God will never entrust His authority to such kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man has a natural liking to put his hands on others' business, God will not be able to use such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man has to be like God, who does not like to control anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If God wanted to control anything, He could remove the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or He could put a fence around the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could remove the fiery sword from the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But God would not do such kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He never likes to interfere with the liberty of others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man has to make his own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some brothers and sisters like to interfere with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God has no interest in such kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He never forces anyone to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He says, "Every one who believes...would have eternal life" John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who receives has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He does not force man to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man has been dealt with by God to such a degree that he no longer has a liking to interfere with others' business, God will entrust His authority to such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man should not have a desire to interfere with another member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man has been taught by God, he will firstly have no desire to interfere with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, he will gladly seek advice from others concerning his own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we practice this, when thousands of members come together, with each one having no desire to interfere with others' business while gladly seeking advice from others, a beautiful Body life will be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do this, we will be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has no desire for us to be busybodies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to be a person who has learned the lessons, and we have to reject and restrict all forms of individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, we have to accept limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, we have to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a joyful thing to pursue after submission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, in the whole world, in all the nations and among all the societies, there are all kinds of opinions, voices, expressions, and arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why all organizations have their rules, and when they conduct meetings, some are given permission to ask questions whereas others are given permission to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who speak cannot go on beyond a certain number of minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This proves that even in the world, an individual has to be limited by the group.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, this limitation is an artificial one, and not one that is done in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Submitting to the Arrangement of the Head,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and Receiving the Riches from the Members</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first sin of man was rebellion, lawlessness, and the overthrowing of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan's fall and rebellion were caused by his uplifting of himself to be above God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we submit ourselves to God's authority today, we will have the proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to realize that not everyone has the authority, and not everyone has the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The testimony of the Body today has nothing to do with numbers, but it is a matter of being in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a matter of being willing to submit to the arrangement of the Head, as opposed to being free to make one's own choices and decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a member of the Body, we cannot make any decision on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ has an immeasurably vast deposit in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are in a receiving position, we will surely become very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we insist on receiving only from God without receiving from the Body, we will become very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not a doctrine, but a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only is the thing I have my own, but what the brothers and sisters have is also my own.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In many matters, other brothers and sisters have a clear discernment, but I do not have discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As such a one, I have to accept the discernment of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some people know God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some can discern the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I should gladly receive their discernment and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What I do not know, someone else will know.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we will not receive from others, probably we will end up fifty years from now having the same as what we have now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a strange thing that we have to exhort the brothers and sisters to receive from others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, men say that they are poor and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, they are not willing to receive riches from others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Is this not a strange thing?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How rich are the ministries that God has raised up in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet we are still in hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reason for this is that we emphasize our own individualism too much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A man has to learn to bow down his head and to receive supply from others.</S>
