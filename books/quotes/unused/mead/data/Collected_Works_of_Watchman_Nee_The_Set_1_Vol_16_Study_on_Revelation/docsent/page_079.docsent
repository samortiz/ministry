   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Revelation 21:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain" is in contrast to "And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness" in 17:3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. Revelation 21:11</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Having the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This city especially has the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In ancient times the glory of God in the temple was not obvious since it appeared like a cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Her light."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is this light the glory of God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The answer is no, because in verse 23 "the glory of God illumined it" and the Lamb is the lamp of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The illumination of the glory of God is upon everything, but the shining of the lamp is limited to one place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, the shining in the Holy of Holies was by the glory of God, while the shining in the Holy Place was by the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 4:5 of this book, the seven lamps of fire are mentioned in relation to the Holy Spirit before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the Holy Spirit's being sent forth into all the earth, it is the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Crystal" is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the shining of the sun is not even universal, but the light of the new city in that day will be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not know what color this light will be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All that we know is that it will be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. The Gates of the City</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 21:12-13; cf. verse 21</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both verses 12 and 21 mention "twelve gates."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to verse 21 the street is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since there are twelve gates, it should follow that there are twelve streets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can there be only one street?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The street in verse 21 is like a square in the middle of the city, around which are roads.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since every side of the city has three gates, every side must also have three roads.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And at the gates twelve angels."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The angels here are not kings; they are the guards of the gates of the new city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"And names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Israel represents the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls" 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pearl represents the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, we can see that one enters the gates of God according to God's law and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>E. The Height of the City</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 21:14-17</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 14 says, "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 16 says, "He measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then verse 17 says, "He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The city is twelve thousand stadia in length, width, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One stadia is equal to 606.75 feet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The total height of the city is twelve thousand stadia, but the height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The height of twelve thousand stadia is measured from the bottom foundation all the way to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The numbers in this chapter are either twelve or multiples of twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Twelve thousand stadia is a multiple of twelve, and twelve is the number of eternal completion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The wall of the city has twelve foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Each layer probably is smaller than the layer under it, similar to the shape of a pyramid.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, all twelve layers can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb v. 14 . The apostles represent the grace of God; therefore, the grace of God makes up the foundations of the wall of the city.</S>
