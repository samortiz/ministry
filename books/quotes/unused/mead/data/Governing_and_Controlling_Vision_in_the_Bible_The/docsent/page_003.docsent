   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENTIRE BIBLE BEING CONCERNED WITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible has two big sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Old Testament includes types and prophecies, both of which are concerned with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The types are portraits of God s economy; the prophecies refer to the economy of God to come, that is, the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None of the types of the Old Testament can be separated from God s economy; it is even more so with the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament is the fulfillment of all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament the economy of God is fulfilled and accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every book, every chapter, and every verse of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation, are concerned with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the New Testament revelation which is also called the teaching of the apostles Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here apostles does not refer to all the apostles; it refers particularly to the few writers of the New Testament whose writings constitute the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teaching of the apostles that we speak of today is not our own teaching; it is the entire New Testament written by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The main components of the New Testament are the writings of John, Paul, and Peter; besides these, there are the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, James, and Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew was one of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Gospel of Mark may also be called the Gospel of Peter, because Mark received his learning from Peter cf.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 Pet 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What he wrote originated from and belonged to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Luke, who was an attendant physician to Paul cf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Col 4:14 , wrote the Gospel of Luke based upon what he saw through Paul; hence, the Gospel of Luke may also be called the Gospel of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Luke also wrote the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke s writings may be considered as belonging to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul wrote all the fourteen Epistles from Romans to Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Hebrews, we have the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Due to the lack of a clear view concerning God s New Testament economy, James put undue emphasis on individual, practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What he wrote may be considered a contrasting background.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Epistles of Peter follow the Epistle of James, and the Epistles of John follow the Epistles of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, we have the Epistle of Jude with only one chapter, and its content is very close to what Peter wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jude is followed by Revelation, which was written by John and is the last book of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In reality, the teaching of the apostles mainly consists of the writings of John, Paul, and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teaching of the apostles is concluded in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, at the end of Revelation, John says that nothing can be added to the book, nor can anything be taken away from the book 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing should be added or subtracted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Testament revelation is thus concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the revelation of the New Testament; this is also the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Testament revelation, the teaching of the apostles, is concerned with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 1 Timothy 1:3-4, we may say that God s economy is the general term for God s New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul said that he left Timothy in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the context, different teachings refer to teachings that are not in line with the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What certain ones taught, though somewhat based on the New Testament revelation, were genealogies and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These were different from God s economy in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should not have taught things outside of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows us that God s economy is the New Testament revelation, the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is uniquely one, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nothing can be added to it or taken away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today in the church we should teach only according to the New Testament revelation, which is the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything less than this is inadequate, and anything more than this is man s teaching, not the words of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I repeat: The Old Testament speaks with types and prophecies of the things to come in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Testament is a revelation composed of the speaking of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Among the apostles, John spoke a great deal, and what he spoke can be considered the beginning and the conclusion; Paul spoke even more, and his speaking may be considered the center and the framework; Peter also spoke, adding something as a supplement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the New Testament revelation, unveiled by the teaching of the apostles and composed of words concerning the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Anything we speak today whatever it is should come out of the apostles teaching and concern God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Beginning with Brother Nee to this day, we have thoroughly covered the economy of God in its entirety and in completeness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have studied every verse and touched every item from Matthew 1:1 to Revelation 22:21.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thank God that, under His sovereign grace, all these things have been printed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The words released through Brother Nee s ministry were very rich, but according to my knowledge, many of the notes of his speaking were not printed in books.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this reason, I have a deep regret.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I was with him in mainland China, we had a great deal of fellowship, and all of it was concerning the revelation in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, I am very clear about Brother Nee s knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, he used the term plan instead of economy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He clearly pointed out to me the eternal plan, the eternal economy, of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brother Nee indeed had a unique view of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I thank the Lord for putting me at his side for eighteen years that I might learn much from him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every time I heard his speaking, the light came and my understanding was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, at the end of 1933, the beginning of my entry into the Lord s work, Brother Nee prepared to have a conference in January of the next year on Christ as the centrality and universality of God, that is, concerning Christ being all and in all, the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One afternoon when I went to his home, he asked me where I was in my reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I told him that I was in Acts and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said, Very good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These two books are related.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This word puzzled me because I could not see how these two books were related.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brother Nee explained to me that Acts shows us how Jesus ascended to heaven and was made Christ by God 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet only a sketch of this Christ is given in Acts; the details are explained by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Among the fourteen Epistles of Paul, only a short book, the book of Colossians, is occupied specifically with Christ s fullness, riches, and all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, Colossians is connected to Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Nee s word on that day really opened my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today Christians may know that Acts 2 refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus and His being made Christ by God, but they lack the understanding of the all-inclusiveness of Christ unveiled in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All these precious revelations in the Word were given to us by God, but regretfully, they were not printed in books at Brother Nee s time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Consequently, in 1974 I began to have the burden to study the entire Bible in the way of a life-study.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We began simultaneously to cover the New Testament in the two big annual trainings and the Old Testament during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I truly worship the Lord that presently we have only three books left to cover: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Actually, Brother Nee already covered Song of Songs with a detailed exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, in 1972 in the United States, I covered life and building in Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, I have not touched Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the summer training this year, we will discover that these two books are absolutely different from our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thank the Lord, we now have a complete set of life-studies, from Genesis to Revelation, with a penetrating explanation of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Last year the Lord led us to begin the crystallization-study of the Bible, a study which goes even deeper than the life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Recently, I have been on the crystallization-study of Romans every Wednesday night.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The life-study opens the entire Bible to us in a general way, but we still need to touch the depths, the crystals, of the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although we are acquainted with the book of Romans and I have expounded it several times, there are still many hidden things as the intrinsic essence of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By such a crystallization-study, the Lord can reveal to us the intrinsic essence of the divine revelation, item by item.</S>
