   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR AND THE TENT Scripture Reading: Gen 12:7-8; 13:3, 4, 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The life of a Christian is the life of the altar and the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The altar is toward God while the tent is toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His presence, God requires that His children have an altar and on the earth that they have a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An altar calls for a tent, and a tent in turn demands an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is impossible to have an altar without a tent, and it is also impossible to have a tent without a return to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The altar and the tent are interrelated; they cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 12:7 says, "The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse we see that the altar is based on God's appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is no divine appearance, there is no altar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can offer himself to God unless he has first met God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unless God has appeared to a man, he cannot offer his all to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consecration is not the result of man's exhortation or persuasion but of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one can voluntarily offer up all he has on the altar if God has not first appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By nature, no one can offer himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when a man does want to offer himself to God, he finds that he really has nothing to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some have said, "I want to give my heart to the Lord, but my heart will not agree."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man cannot come over to God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when man meets God, consecration takes place spontaneously in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you catch sight of God just once and touch God just once, you are no longer your own.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is Someone who cannot be touched lightly!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once a man touches God, he can no longer live for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize that the power to offer oneself to God comes through His appearance; it comes from His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who talk about consecration are not necessarily consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not everyone who preaches consecration or understands the doctrine of consecration is a consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only those who have seen God are consecrated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God appeared to Abraham, and the immediate issue was that Abraham built an altar to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus, and Paul immediately asked, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A turning point in our spiritual life does not come through our decision to do something for God; it does not come as a result of our resolving to do this or that for God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It comes when we see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we meet God, a radical change takes place in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can no longer do what we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we meet God Himself, we have the power to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The matter of denying one's self ceases to be optional when we have met God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His appearance makes a person unable to go on by himself; it forces him to not live by himself anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's appearance brings with it inexhaustible power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such an appearance will alter the whole course of a person's life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For a Christian, the power to live for God is based on his vision of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not our decision to serve the Lord that enables us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not our will to build an altar that produces an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>An altar is built when God comes to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord that He does not have to say anything when He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet many times, He chooses to say something when He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God appeared to Abraham, He said to him, "Unto thy seed have I given this land" Gen 15:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's appearance brings us into a new inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It brings the realization that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as an earnest of the inheritance which we shall later possess in fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The part that we have received today in the Holy Spirit will be ours in full in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God's plan is fulfilled, we will enter the full inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This altar was not for a sin offering but for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A sin offering is for redemption, while a burnt offering is an offering of ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The altar here does not refer to the Lord Jesus' vicarious death for us; it refers to the consecration of ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was the kind of altar spoken of in Romans 12:1: "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The mercy of God caused the Lord Jesus to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The mercy of God provided the cross on which we died with Him and on which the devil was dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By the mercy of God we have His life within, and by His mercy, He will bring us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is on the ground of His mercies that God beseeches us to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In connection with the burnt offering, we should note that a person of ample resources may have offered a bullock, one with less resources may have offered a sheep, and one whose means were even more limited may have offered a turtledove or pigeon Lev 1:3, 10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But whether one offered a bullock, a sheep, or a turtledove or pigeon, the offerer had to offer up the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One could not offer half a bullock or half a sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God wants everything whole; He does not want a half offering.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He cannot accept anything less than utter consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For what purpose was the burnt offering placed on the altar?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was to be wholly burned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of us think that we offer ourselves to God to do this or that for Him, whereas what He wants of us is a burning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He does not need a bullock to plow the field for Him; He wants the bullock to be burned on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God is not after our work, but ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He wants us to offer ourselves to Him and be burned for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The altar does not signify doing something for God but living for God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The altar does not mean having busy activities but having a living for God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No activity or work can replace the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The altar is a life that is totally for God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Unlike the sacrifice of the Old Testament, which was utterly burned in one act, the sacrifice of the New Testament, as depicted in Romans 12, is the presenting of our bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Daily we are consumed on the altar, yet daily we are living; we are ever living, yet ever consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the sacrifice of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham offered himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once a man sees God, he will offer himself up totally to God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is impossible for a man to see God and yet be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The altar is present as soon as a person sees God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once there is the taste of His grace, the result is the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once a man sees God's mercy, he becomes a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the Lord's light comes, he will say, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Abraham had not heard many doctrines about consecration, nor had he been urged by others to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But Abraham had seen God, and when he did, he immediately built an altar to God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Oh, brothers and sisters, consecration is a spontaneous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Anyone to whom God has manifested Himself cannot do anything other than live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once God appears to a person, he will live totally for God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>So it was with Abraham, and so it has been with everyone who has met God throughout the two thousand years of church history.</S>
