   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THAT WE HAVE BEEN REDEEMED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18 says, Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to grammar, verse 18 is related to pass the time of your sojourning in fear in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that in order to pass the time of our sojourning in fear, we need a deep realization concerning the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today many Christians are living in a loose way because their understanding of Christ s redemption is shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was a child studying in the elementary school of a Baptist mission, I heard much about the cross of Christ and Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, nothing that I heard touched my heart, for that teaching regarding the redemption of Christ was shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not know why the missionaries and the Chinese ministers did not say something weighty from 1:18 and 19.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I cannot recall hearing any teaching from these verses while I attended that school.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the preaching concerning Christ s redemption that I heard there was very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter s way of speaking about redemption in these verses is far from superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that anyone who would read these verses by concentrating his entire being on them would be touched when Peter says, Knowing that you were redeemed...with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to verse 18, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from our vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life in verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to most other references in Scripture, the blood of Christ redeems us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things Eph 1:7; Heb 9:15; Titus 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here is an exception: Christ s blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life, because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness, but on the manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The whole chapter emphasizes the holy manner of life which God s chosen people should have in their sojourn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only is the Spirit s sanctification for this; even Christ s redemption is for this to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we pass the days of our sojourning in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our old manner of life, a life in lusts 1 Pet 1:14 , had no meaning and no goal; hence, it was vain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But now to live a holy life, to express God in His holiness, is our goal vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many precious biblical terms, terms which are very important in the Word, have become common and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may even say that they have been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word redeemed is an example of a biblical term that has become religious because of the way it is commonly used.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, when we read this word in the Bible, we may not have much feeling within us concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when Peter wrote 1:18 and 19, he was full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>PURCHASED BY THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I prefer to translate the Greek word for redeemed as purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually this is the meaning of the Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have been purchased by the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As fallen human beings, we were in a dreadful situation before we experienced Christ s redemption: we were merchandise up for sale in an unclean marketplace, the marketplace of the vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the spiritual feelings within you are tender when you are in a shopping center, you will realize that such a place is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outwardly, it may be very clean; however, spiritually speaking, it is very dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, nearly everything in a shopping center is related to the vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly, we were merchandise up for sale in Satan s shopping center, in his unclean, worldly market.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today all of human society is an unclean market.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we were items on sale in Satan s shopping center, Christ came to purchase us, to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He paid a very high price to buy us the price of His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan did not want Christ to buy us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan s plan was that we would be bought by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, when Satan realized that Christ had come to purchase us, he caused a great deal of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unwilling to release us, to let us go, he raised up many obstacles and barriers to frustrate Christ from purchasing us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, Christ died on the cross and shed His precious blood to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From our side, we were purchased, but from Satan s side, we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The blood that redeemed us was an extraordinary kind of blood the blood of the God-man, Jesus Christ, the Man whose life reached the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus is a Man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, when this Man died on the cross, God also passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No human words are adequate to explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the blood of Christ was qualified and sufficient to redeem us, to purchase us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We had been put on sale by the enemy Satan, our usurper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Christ, our Redeemer, paid the highest price to purchase us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter speaks of this in verses 18 and 19.</S>
