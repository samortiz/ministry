   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENTERING INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to study the Bible well, we have to acquaint ourselves with the thoughts of the Holy Spirit as well as the facts from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, we have to enter into the spirit of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Touching the Spirit behind the Word</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's Spirit prompted men to write the Scriptures, and whether it is history or doctrines, each portion has a spirit of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every portion of the Bible has its own unique spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit expresses Himself through the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we say that the Holy Spirit rejoices, the Holy Spirit is not just rejoicing within Himself; rather, the Holy Spirit is rejoicing through man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, when we say that the Holy Spirit grieves, the Holy Spirit is not grieving within Himself; rather, the Holy Spirit is grieving through man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, when the Holy Spirit enters man's spirit, the condition of the Holy Spirit becomes the condition of man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Putting it another way, we can say that the condition of man's spirit is the condition of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Spirit of God recorded history, He recorded the facts of history.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this history contained not only facts, it also captured a certain spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can say that certain feelings and conditions of the Spirit are impregnated within each portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same principle, in the writing of the Epistles, the Holy Spirit did not just convey doctrines and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Behind every passage there is the feeling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible is not merely a book full of facts and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the surface there are the words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Underneath the words there are thoughts, and behind the thoughts is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we only touch the words, our reading of the Bible is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we can form a proper impression and enter into the thoughts behind the words, we have gone deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if we remain in this realm, our understanding is still very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Behind every word of God is a certain spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The feeling of the Holy Spirit and the condition of the writers govern these writings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we study the Bible, we have to touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is an inseparable link between the word and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ministry of the word is the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anyone who stands up to be a minister of the word has to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he cannot release his spirit, he cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, the spirit must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One must have a right spirit before he can have a right ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We often fail as ministers of the word because the spirit cannot match the word that is released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is nothing wrong with the words that are spoken, yet something is wrong with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The words are strong, but the spirit is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the ministers of the word in the Bible did not have this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their spirit matched the content of their writings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Behind every passage and every book, there is a proper spirit; this spirit is impregnated in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In releasing the ministry of the word, we need the word on the surface and the spirit to back up the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In receiving the ministry of the word, we also have to touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we study the Bible, our purpose is to receive the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such ones, we have to touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not touch that spirit, our understanding of the Bible will be very shallow indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At most we will have some doctrines and facts; we will not find spiritual nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If God's word is only impressions and thoughts to us, it cannot become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's word must become spirit before it can become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our food can only come as we touch the spirit behind the word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The essence of the Bible is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not touch the spirit behind a passage, we have not touched that portion of the Scriptures yet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In reading the Bible, we have to touch the spirit, that is, the particular spirit behind a portion of the Word.</S>
