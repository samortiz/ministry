   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For these who already know the Baptism of the Spirit, and the path of the Cross, the pressing need is light on the warfare with Satan; but another need on a wider scale is the experimental knowledge of the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, for a vast number of believers do not know this, and the two-fold aspect of the Cross: therefore they cannot understand what we mean by "warfare" and the need of the discerning of spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not enough to proclaim victory over the powers of darkness, you must lead the children of God to know the Cross in its relation to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The warfare of Ephesians 6 is a spiritual warfare, and only through the death of the Cross is the believer brought into the spiritual realm, and the conflict there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians are perplexed over receiving the Holy Spirit because they think they only have the proof of having done so, if they have manifestations of His presence: so on this subject many questions arise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Scriptures make it clear that you receive Him by faith Galatians 3:2, 3 , but there is a succeeding work to be done in real surrender to obey Him, and the putting of all obstacles out of the way of His fullest working; the hindrances must be removed to His working through the believer, and the wrong things in the life put away, as revealed progressively by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When does the special need of light on the powers of darkness and their workings now come in?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All over the world there are large numbers of believers definitely and clearly preaching full assurance of salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then there are an increasing number of believers who really know the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and are in the "Revival" plane, or the plane of knowing the Holy Spirit, and co-working with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again there are others a smaller company knowing the Holy Spirit, who have really pressed on in the power of the Spirit to follow the Lamb of Calvary in the path of the Cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now speaking generally, these last-named believers are blocked, because they have no glimmer of anything beyond this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have thought that they have simply to go on to the end in the path of the Cross in the Spirit of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Meanwhile the powers of darkness have been coming in like a flood to the Church of Christ, blocking and hindering the work of God on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The message needed by these souls who know the fellowship of the Cross or the crucified life is the knowledge of the aggressive war upon the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The call to these is, "Arise, in the new life of Christ, and in the equipment of the Holy Ghost whom you have already known to lead you unto death and lay hold of the Victory of Christ, and take the aggressive against the foe."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Having died to the old fleshly life of activity the soulish life energy having died to the world, and become separated unto Christ; these are the souls who need to see their union with Christ in the ascension life, and His authority over all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we must point out a cause of danger in the life of many who know the path of the Cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have learned the power of the Holy Ghost, and the path of the Cross; they have understood that they were to "follow the Lamb"; to submit to the will of God; and they have followed on in that path faithfully, until now they may have unknowingly gone on a point too far.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their "surrender" may have become "passivity" i.e., a passive condition of mind, and sometimes of all their faculties which is not according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having ceased to "resist" in the "flesh" they have sunk into a passive submission to all things around them, not only to the "will of God", but to the will of Satan, and failed in their attitude of resistance "in the spirit" to the spiritual foe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their surrender to "the will of God" became, or has become unconsciously, a passive-submission to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There has undoubtedly come upon the Church a heavy pressure of the powers of darkness, and many souls who know the Cross are failing to detect between the "will of God" and the "will of Satan"; and they are presenting no resistance, and no solid front against the adversary and his hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surrender to God has lapsed into "passivity", or passive endurance of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have only the view of the Lamb, and not the Lion-LAMB the Lamb who submits to death, but not the LION-LAMB who triumphs over the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These souls must arise out of their passive condition, and in the power of the Spirit go forward into aggressive warfare against the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They must use their renewed will in active co-operation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They must take the aggressive with victory-prayer against every hindrance that the devil puts in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should march forward claiming the victory of the Cross over all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are the souls who, because of their baptism into death, and consequent cessation of fleshly and soulish energy, may receive, or "take", and exercise the "gifts of the Spirit".</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever gift is necessary for their service in this warfare, they may take as part of the provided equipment of the Spirit for this hour of need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Note also that souls in each plane can help and lead others in the plane behind them, but they cannot push any one forward into the plane before them, nor fully understand or "judge" others in the plane ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the path ahead there are conditions, realms of knowledge, points of danger, only known to those in that degree, and unseen and not understood by souls in earlier degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enemy knows this, and oft-times pushes a "babe" in the second plane to resist truths only understood further on.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet the truths suited to planes three and four must be spoken for those who need them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lastly, let it be distinctly stated that the description of these degrees in the spiritual life of a believer is given from the experimental, or "subjective" aspect, and not from the judicial or positional side of truth, wherein a "babe in Christ" may be said to be as "complete in Him" from the moment of conversion, as at the end of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A child grows from the baby-stage, degree after degree, into manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Philippians 3:13, 14.</S>
