<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Zion's Stones as the Pleasure<br>of the Lord's Servants<br>and Her Dust in Which Is Their Favor</H2><P>Psalm 102:14 says, "Your servants take pleasure in her stones,/And show favor to her soil." The Hebrew word translated "soil" can also be rendered "dust." In this verse the stones typify the believers as the building materials of the church (1 Pet. 2:5), and the dust, the soil, typifies the ground of the church. Do you take pleasure in all the members of the church? Do you favor the ground of the church? We should be happy with all the members of the church, and we should care for the ground of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Bringing the Peoples<br>and the Kingdoms of the Earth<br>into the Praise and Worship of Jehovah</H2><P>Psalm 102:21 and 22 say, "That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion,/And His praise, in Jerusalem;/When the peoples are gathered together,/And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah." These verses indicate that it is through the established, restored Zion&#151;the church&#151;that all the nations and kingdoms will be brought into the praise and worship of Jehovah. This means that the church turns the world to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Because of His Eternal and<br>Unchanging Existence</H2><P>Christ is the key that turns the earth to the Lord because of His eternal and unchanging existence (vv. 24-27; Heb. 1:10-12). Christ died and resurrected, and now He lives forever in His resurrection. Christ's existence is unchanging throughout all the generations because of His resurrection.</P><P>Christ's death produced the church. The church has been devastated and will be restored. Christ's resurrection then will enable the church to continue its existence.</P>
