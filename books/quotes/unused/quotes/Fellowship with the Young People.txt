Abel, the second generation of man in the line of life, was probably also young when he offered sacrifices to the Lord
He was sixty-five years old when he began to walk with God, but at his time a man who was sixty-five years old was still young
If you read the Scriptures carefully, you will see that Abraham was seventy-five years old when his father Terah died in Haran
Acts 7:2 tells us that 'the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran'
The first time God called Abraham was while his father was still alive, and the second call came after his father had died
At the age of eighty Moses 'graduated' from a period of training by God, but he was called into this training when he was very young
The Lord comes to the young people for His move because the older people are, the more they are likely to be spoiled and preoccupied
The difficult times spoken of in these verses are the times when mankind is thoroughly spoiled and fully occupied by Satan
Certain scholars have compared the situation in the United States since the 1950s to the situation of the Roman Empire in the first century
According to Genesis, by the time Babel and its tower were built, mankind was fully ruined, captured, and preoccupied by the Devil
Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, conquered Jerusalem, captured the vessels of God's temple, and carried them into his idol temple
He and his three friends, who were of the children of Judah, were selected to come into the king's palace to be taught
Daniel and his three friends purposed in their heart not to be defiled, not to have any share in that defiling element
For Daniel and his three friends not to eat the king's food was to protest, to be God's testimony, against the tide of idolatry
Daniel was still living during the reigns of Darius and Cyrus after the Babylonian Empire had become the Persian Empire
When he read the prophecy given through Jeremiah that the captivity would be accomplished for seventy years he began to pray for Gods people
The meat and the wine provided by King Nebuchadnezzar were surely a strong temptation to Daniel and his three friends
The young people need to flee youthful lusts, and they should also pursue, that is, seek after, righteousness, faith, love, and peace
If we have four companions to support us from each direction, we will not fall, regardless of what storm may come
If we love the Lord, we should be able to go to any young brother or sister, not caring for what they are like
In the previous chapter we saw that the young people need to purpose in their heart not to be defiled by the things of this age
They need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions, 'those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
The Lords recovery is not a recovery of doctrines such as footwashing head covering proper baptisms or the bread and wine at the Lords table
The angels and mankind were the two main items of God's creation, the living creatures which God created for His purpose
When Christ ascended to the heavens, God inaugurated Him officially, universally, and once for all, putting Him into His position
Acts 236 says Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christthis Jesus whom you crucified
On the day of ascension a man by the name of Jesus, who was mingled with God, was inaugurated to be the Lord of all
The Christ is the Lord's title in His commission, while the Son of the living God is the title of the Lord's person, indicating who He is
They considered it blasphemy for Jesus, a man from Nazareth, to say that He was the Son of God, making Himself equal with God
While the Father is the source of life, the Son is the expression, the propagation, and the multiplication of life
The Spirit of whom we are born is not only God Himself, but also the Son of the living God as life to us, the Word and the Spirit
His commission is creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension for the bringing forth and building up of the church
All the steps of Christ's commission are for the church, either to produce the church, to bring it into existence, or to build the church
Without the building up of the church, Christ as God's anointed One can never accomplish His commission to consummate the building
Just as Christ has two aspects, His person and His ministry, the church also has two aspects, the universal aspect and the local aspect
Fornication and adultery are abominable in the eyes of God because they destroy humankind and spoil the significance of marriage
Just as Sarah foolishly proposed that Abraham take a concubine , the church in the past has produced many 'concubines'
They must see that according to God's eternal plan, the very anointed One of God should have only one Body, one wife, the church
To come into the Lord's recovery as a young person and carry on the divine economy is glorious and becomes more glorious as time goes on
All the surrounding Arab countries have not been able to do anything to that little nation of just over two million people
In Revelation there are two groups of one hundred forty-four thousand, one from Israel and one from the church
The nation of Israel is established even though they are still unbelieving, but today the Lord is waiting for the church
We must see the universal aspect of the Body, and we must also see the local aspect of the church, the local churches
Praise the Lord, in the Lord's recovery we have seen not only God, Christ, and the universal Body, but also the local churches
If you wish to find the Lord Jesus, you must get into the seven lampstands, which are the seven local churches
Today the Lord Jesus, not only as the Son of God but also as the Son of Man, is in the midst of the local churches
In the previous chapters we saw that the young people in the Lords recovery must flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions
When a group comes together, one brother may ask the others if they can speak something concerning the assurance of salvation
The young people should thoroughly fellowship matters such as the assurance of salvation and regeneration in their groups
If they do not, we may eventually have a good number of saints among us, but they will not be thoroughly rooted in spiritual matters
If five young people cannot speak clearly to each other about the assurance of salvation, how can they help others?
Those who take the lead among the young people should recommend one or two points for them to cover each week in their small groups
Every church needs such a solid foundation so that when new ones come to the church they can be helped to know the life experiences
Without such a foundation, we may have a large number of young people, yet not many of them will be clear about the truth
The young ones should be helped to know what the assurance of salvation is, what regeneration is, and what eternal life is
If each group covers one or two points a week, after half a year they will have covered thirty or forty basic points
God is Spirit , Christ our Redeemer has become a life-giving Spirit , and the third of the Godhead for God to reach us is the Holy Spirit
There is no other way for us to contact God, to contact Christ, to contact the Spirit, but by our human spirit
The young people must concentrate their whole being on the divine Spirit and our human spirit mingled together as one spirit
They should know 1 Corinthians 1545 and be able to explain how Christ became a lifegiving Spirit and why Christ needed to become the Spirit
When we pray to stir up our spirit and pray ourselves into our spirit, we will experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit
The holy Word is very profound, and many Christians in the past may have known it only according to the letter
The young people should purpose not to read anything other than the messages whenever they have the opportunity
Sometimes when you come to a certain point, you may need to consider it for a while, and sometimes you may need to pray about it
Perhaps we may read the New Testament once or twice every year and the Old Testament once every one or two years
In the gospel, in visiting the saints, in shepherding, in functioning, in material matters, and in everything, we must learn to give
When five young ones come together one may feel that he knows so little but he should present what he knows or has experienced to the others
