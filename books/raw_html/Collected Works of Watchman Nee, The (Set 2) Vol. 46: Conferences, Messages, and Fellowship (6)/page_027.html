<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY</h1><h1 class="title">FAITH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 11:24</h1><p>The promise of Mark 11:24 is very comprehensive. It is one of the biggest verses in the Bible. John 3:16 speaks of "every one," but this verse speaks of "all things." John 3:16 tells us that "every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life"; Mark 11:24 tells us that "all things that you pray and ask...you will have them." This is a very comprehensive verse; "all things" includes everything. But this verse has a condition: we must believe. If we do not have faith, we cannot have what we ask for. This verse not only tells us of the necessity of faith but also the nature of faith. As far as I can tell, this is the only verse which tells us of the nature of faith.</p><p>What is the nature of faith? What should we believe? When we see something spiritual and reach for it, how should we believe? I am not here dealing with the necessity of faith&mdash;this is apparent. The question is about how to believe, and this is the only verse which answers this question. "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them." How should we believe? "Believe that you have received." The way to believe is not that we will receive or can receive or that we are able to receive or are going to receive, but that we already have received. Faith is that we have received, not that we will receive one day. There is nothing so wrong as believing with all our heart that we can receive or that we are going to receive. This is hope, not faith. Faith refers to the past, it has nothing to do with the future. What is in the future is always hope, not faith. Our Lord did not say, "You must believe that you are going to receive." On the contrary, He said, "You must believe that you have already received." It is something already done by God, something given to us by God. Whenever our faith is in the future, it is not faith but hope. Let us see from a few illustrations what the right kind of faith&mdash;"have received"&mdash;means.</p><h2 class="head1">SALVATION</h2><p>Suppose I am a gospel preacher, and a sinner comes along and asks me to tell him the way of salvation. I do my best to make it clear, telling him about the blood, the cross, atonement, redemption, and that the Lord has done everything. Then he says that he wants to be saved. We both kneel down together. Then I pray a little and ask him to pray. He says, "Lord, I know that the blood of Christ Your Son cleanses from all sin, so please forgive my sins. Amen." Before getting up I ask, "Are your sins forgiven? Are you saved?" He replies, "I believe I will be saved, I believe God will forgive my sins, I believe with all my heart that God can forgive my sins." Is this man saved? No! Are his sins forgiven? No. What should he say? He should just look up and say, "Praise the Lord, all my sins are forgiven; praise the Lord, all my sins have already been forgiven; praise the Lord, I am saved." There is only one kind of faith&mdash;have received. This principle operates in regard to everything else. So much of so-called faith is only hope. Many say that they have faith, but it is all in the future. They think they are going to get something some day. But we are not going to get something some day, we have already got it!</p>
