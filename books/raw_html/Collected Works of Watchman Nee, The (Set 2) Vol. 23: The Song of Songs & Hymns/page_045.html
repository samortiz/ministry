<li>GROWTH IN GRACE<br /></li>30. Once it was the blessing<br />32. I dare not be defeated<br />37. My King will soon come back again<br />49. Nothing between, Lord, nothing between<br />58. Not I, but Christ be honored, loved, exalted<br />59. My heart today would sing with joyfulness<br />60. If I would only stray a bit<br />132.	If the path I travel<br />141.	O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me<br /><br /><li>SEEKING IN THE SPIRITUAL PATHWAY<br /></li>22. Receive His victory<br />43. Make me a captive, Lord<br />51. Lord, reveal Thyself to me<br />52. Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?<br />64. More holiness give me<br />67. Many crowd the Savior's kingdom<br />78. He died for me that I might live<br />142.	Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ<br />143.	Thou hidden love of God, whose height<br />177.	O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer<br /><br /><li>CONSOLATION OF THE PILGRIMS<br /></li>25. O grave, your power is annulled<br />26. Heav'nly glory, heav'nly brightness<br />31. Can I forget the coming Lord?<br />33. "On toward the goal!" Press on!<br />38. When my blest Lord will come again<br />44. Conflict today is fierce<br />71. There remains not much more time<br />73. Lord Jesus, I am waiting<br />75. We shall not die, but raptured see the Lord!<br />88. He looked for a city and lived in a tent<br />92. Our home is higher than the highest stars<br /><br /><li>PRAYER MEETING<br /></li>39. Teach us to pray that we may cause<br />40. Lord, oh come unto me<br />50. He said, "I will come soon"<br />122.	Revive Thy work, O Lord!<br /><br />
