   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AMALEK A. Warlike, Destroying, Disturbing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The name Amalek means warlike.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The flesh enjoys fighting and never wants to keep the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, the flesh is very destructive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The greatest destroyer of the Christian life is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The flesh destroys our married life, family life, and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seeks to destroy everything positive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consider how much the flesh has destroyed since you became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The flesh is not only warlike and destructive, but also extremely disturbing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you read Romans 7, you will see what disturbance is caused by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to that chapter, Paul was so disturbed that he even cried out, Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death? v. 24 . Apparently this disturbance was caused by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually it was caused by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How warlike, destructive, and disturbing the flesh is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. A Descendant of Esau</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amalek was a descendant of Esau Gen 36:12 , Jacob s twin brother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Esau and Jacob were very close.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that the flesh, signified by Esau, is close to our regenerated being, signified by Jacob, who became Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Esau was born first, then Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that the flesh belongs to the first man, and our regenerated being, to the second.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible speaks of two different Amaleks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Amalek mentioned in Genesis 14:7 is different from the Amalek who was the descendant of Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, some Bible students, not aware of this distinction, think of these two Amaleks as one and the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be clear, therefore, that the Bible tells us about two different Amaleks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Amalek in Exodus 17 descended from Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, it was the second Amalek, who descended from Esau, who troubled God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our concern is with this Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our flesh is the descendant of Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the flesh is of the first man, that is, the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The flesh is the issue, the coming forth, of the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Close to Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have pointed out that just as Esau was close to Jacob, the flesh is close to our regenerated being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible nowhere tells us that the descendants of Esau ceased to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, the Edomites, descendants of Esau, were continually a problem to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. Fighting Against Israel</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have seen that Amalek, one of the descendants of Esau, was the first to fight against the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This fighting is a picture of the flesh fighting against the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter refers to this fighting: Beloved, I entreat you as sojourners and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul 1 Pet 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>E. The First Enemy on Israel s Way</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>to the Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Amalek was the first enemy the children of Israel encountered on the way to the good land Deut 25:17-18; 1 Sam 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that our flesh is the first among all our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It takes the lead over sin, the world, and Satan to fight against us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The flesh, sin, the world, and Satan are all related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These four things are interwoven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The most prominent among them in fighting against believers is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan, sin, and the world are all subordinate to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When in our practical Christian experience the flesh is put to death, the world cannot hold us, sin cannot operate in us, and Satan is powerless to work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason the world is prevailing, sin is strong, and Satan is active is that we are still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These three enemies are all dependent on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, the flesh is our foremost enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this reason, the Bible gives a complete picture of Amalek as the first enemy to fight against the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of us can testify that from the time we first began to seek the Lord and to walk in His way, the flesh has been fighting against us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from going on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Under God s guidance, the children of Israel had a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This goal was to enter the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Amalek s purpose in attacking God s people was to frustrate them from entering the land.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We also have the goal of entering into the all-inclusive Christ as our good land and possessing Him as this land.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have been saved, we have made a wonderful exodus out of Egypt, we have crossed the Red Sea, and we have journeyed through the wilderness, where we have had a number of marvelous experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nevertheless, we have not yet reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have not yet entered into the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Knowing that this goal is ahead of us, the enemy, Amalek, endeavors to hinder us from reaching this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is crucial for us to recognize that Satan s aim in stirring up our flesh to fight against us is to keep us from the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The purpose of the flesh in warring against us is to frustrate us from entering into Christ as the all-inclusive land.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must admit that not many Christians, even among us, have entered in a complete way into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Mainly we have been frustrated by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although we may enjoy the Lord in morning watch, the flesh often attacks us soon afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This attack may keep us from the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As a result, throughout the day we have little enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The purpose of the flesh in fighting against us, therefore, is to keep us from the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
