   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SEVEN THE BURNT OFFERING CHRIST FOR GOD'S SATISFACTION 5 EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN HIS EXPERIENCES AND OFFERING THE CHRIST WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND OFFERING HIM TO GOD AS OUR BURNT OFFERING ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERIENCES OF HIM 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Much of what we have covered in the foregoing messages on the burnt offering has been doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, I have the burden that we would see this offering in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the following message we shall consider our experiences of Christ in His experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second part of the title of this message is unusual, even peculiar: "Experiencing Christ in His Experiences and Offering the Christ We Have Experienced, and Offering Him to God as Our Burnt Offering according to Our Experiences of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This part of the title has three points.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first point is experiencing Christ in His experiences; the second is offering the Christ we have experienced; and the third is offering Christ to God as our burnt offering according to our experiences of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we would emphasize the fact that we cannot offer to God a Christ whom we have not experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you try to offer as a burnt offering to God a Christ whom you have not experienced, you will discover that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we offer of Christ as the burnt offering must be according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have experienced Christ as a bull, then we can offer Him as a bull.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we have experienced Christ only as two pigeons, we cannot offer Him as a bull, for we have not experienced Him as a bull.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot offer as a burnt offering to God a Christ who is greater than the Christ we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to offer Christ to God, but we must offer Christ according to our experiences of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I. CHRIST IN HIS EXPERIENCES AS THE BURNT OFFERING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us now consider Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering to God, covering a number of verses that reveal different aspects of Christ's experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ experienced many things in order to be a burnt offering for God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A. Being Brought to the Slaughter</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaiah 53:7 prophesied that Christ would be brought to the slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fulfillment of this prophecy can be seen in Matthew 27:31, where we are told that the soldiers "led Him away to crucify Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another New Testament verse which refers to Christ's being brought to the slaughter is Philippians 2:8, a verse which tells us that Christ became obedient "even unto death, and that the death of a cross."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ was obedient as He was brought outside the city to the place of the slaughter Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. Being Slaughtered</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Pilate had judged the Lord Jesus and had found Him innocent, he wanted to release Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the people were shouting, "Crucify, crucify him!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 23:21 , and their voices prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pilate, being fearful and wanting to please the crowd, sentenced the Lord Jesus to death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord was then brought to the place of slaughter and was slaughtered on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Acts 2:23 Peter refers to this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"This man you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For them to kill the Lord Jesus means that they slaughtered Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many years ago I read an article about how the Jews slew the lamb on the day of Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this article, a lamb was put on two wooden stakes that were arranged in the shape of a cross, with two feet attached to one stake and two feet attached to the cross bar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The lamb was then killed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the Lord's crucifixion may have been a fulfillment of the way, in type, the Passover lamb was slaughtered.</S>
