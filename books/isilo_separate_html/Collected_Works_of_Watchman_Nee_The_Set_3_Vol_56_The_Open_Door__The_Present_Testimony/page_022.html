Because transportation is inconvenient, we cannot often go to the meetings in Tsinan. Therefore, we have been meeting three times a week in our homes. (There are two prayer meetings and one fellowship meeting.) Every Lord's Day some of the brothers go to Tsinan for the Lord's table meeting. When there are conferences or some workers come to Tsinan, many of the brothers and sisters go there. This is our condition. We hope you will pray for us.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Han Lien-ru<br />December 30, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Has Given Us Abundant Grace<br />(Tsinan)</h2><p>Thank the Lord for giving us abundant grace through Brother Yu and Brother Chu. The brothers and sisters all touched the way, and some of their difficulties were resolved. There was a baptism meeting on the eighth of this month, and a hundred seventeen brothers and sisters were baptized. Our hall was too small, and the Lord has prepared a large building that can seat eight hundred people. We have begun to fix it up, and we will move in when it is finished. The old address will still be a district meeting place. Please pray for the way ahead of us.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Liu-zhui<br />October 21, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">God's Mercy and Presence Every Time (Gaoduichun)</h2><p>Brother Yu Cheng-hua and Brother Chu-chen took a detour and spent five or six days here on their way back to Shanghai from the Northwest (Beiyangchun, Linjin). They preached the word twice on the Lord's Day in Yitang and had eight fellowship meetings in Beiyangchun. God's mercy and presence were there every time. They resolved the brothers' basic problems in life and removed the doubts and barriers along the way. The last message was on "The Spirit of Goodness." We saw how shallow we were, and were happy that through this message God had removed an abominable reef from the church's future.</p><p>We are in an extremely remote place, and we have very little fellowship with the other churches. It is even rarer for God's servants to come here. Therefore, these meetings were food to the hungry. They took care of our need and provided fellowship between younger brothers and elder brothers. "O Lord! We can only praise You." May the Lord bless the vessels He uses and bless His redeemed people here.</p><p>Please pray for us so that we could remain in the Lord's grace.</p><p>Wang Feng-zhang and Jiao Zhong-gong<br />October 15, 1950</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
