   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING SCHOOLS Trying the Best to Not Study in Catholic Schools</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers and sisters who are in school should try their best to not attend Catholic schools.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord's intention is that we do not touch the Catholic Church at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has no intention that we change its religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Christian does not have this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation 2 and 18, the Lord does not charge His believers to call those in the Catholic Church to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, He charges the many sons of God to separate themselves from it and to not defile themselves with its sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church in Thyatira in Revelation 2 and the great Babylon in chapter eighteen signify the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is clear that Christians have no responsibility to change Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their responsibility is to depart from it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God hates to see His people worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Idolatry is a great sin in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every king in the books of Kings was judged according to whether or not he had gone in "the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sin by which he caused Israel to sin" 1 Kings 16:26 , which was idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first and second of the Ten Commandments deal with idols Exo 20:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God hates Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No sin of idolatry is greater than that practiced in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It has made idols out of the Lord Jesus and God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is also Mary; it has made an idol of the mother of Jesus and has made her a god.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Catholics are among some of the hardest people in this world to get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If any of you are studying in a Catholic school, please go home and discuss this with your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>See if you can change schools before the next term.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you cannot do it this next term, try the next one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must have the desire to cut off any relationship with Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, if the present situation does not allow you to change schools, do your best to refrain from its worship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to find three or four companions and fellowship together often.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Never try to argue with your teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All you need to do is turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Catholic Jesuits start schools everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their intention is to gain people through education.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you look into the situation, you will notice that they never stand on the street to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you study in their schools, however, you will pick up the Catholic religion after three or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may say that many nuns in the Catholic Church are quite good and quite compassionate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But please remember, they are not approved by God, no matter how good they are, as long as they do not forsake idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Principle Governing the Selection of Schools</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In selecting a school, you have to choose one that is being attended by at least one or two brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not mean that the Lord will not bless the preaching of a single brother or sister; he or she may bring many to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the majority of cases, a single brother is swallowed up by his surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ultimately, the church has to search for him after he becomes lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is rare for one brother to break through in one school, but it is common for one school to swallow up one brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The young people must go to school in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe many of you brothers will be elders and deacons in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, you have to exercise great care and deliberation in your actions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not study in a school by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Principle Governing the Selection of a Career</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of you have decided to stop at a high school education.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These ones have to learn to work with their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the future you have to find a job that gives you more freedom so that you can devote time to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps you can work under other brothers and sisters who are running a business.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In any case, your time must be free.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must not be a slave to mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way you will not neglect the government's mandate on contribution to production since you will be working with your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the same time, you can devote much time to serve the Lord as well as offering up your earnings for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning Daily Necessities</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some of you have too many possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You should learn to give some of them to the poor and be moderate in buying what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This does not necessarily mean that you have to be thrifty in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, if you need a coat, you can buy a good one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are many material things which we cannot be without; we should just find those that satisfy our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we buy impulsively, we will want more when we see a better one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the beginning a simple matter like choosing the right coat can become a problem; when we walk into a department store and see thirty or fifty different colors of the same merchandise, we will want more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are many styles, and our heart will want one of each.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no limit to our lust for possessions.</S>
