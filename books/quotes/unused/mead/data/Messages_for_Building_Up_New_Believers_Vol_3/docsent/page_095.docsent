   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Whole Being Leavened</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word of the Lord here is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second part of Matthew 13:33 says, Until the whole was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please bear in mind that today, the lump of meal is not yet fully leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All orthodox students of prophecy agree that the power of Roman Catholicism has not diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord says that this will go on until the whole is leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, Roman Catholicism has been leavened to quite a serious extent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It has been leavening for over a thousand years!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we cannot say that the lump is fully leavened yet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord says that one day the whole will be leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The power of Catholicism will continue to expand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It will not stop until its end comes, when it is fully consumed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word of the Lord is quite serious here: Until the whole was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the Lord tells us that the power of Roman Catholicism will continue to expand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How great has the Roman Catholic Church become!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How numerous are the heresies found in it!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The leaven has gained more and more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord s supper has become the Mass, and the bread has become the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Transubstantiation, the doctrine of turning the bread into the actual flesh of Christ as soon as one touches it, has prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are incense, crucifixes, and rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People put their trust in various organizations and names.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Catholic Church is more tightly controlled than any country or state in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are all kinds of organizations within it, and one could not understand all of them even if he spent several years to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, it has confused the doctrine of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, the tree has become very large.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Pope Becoming the Universal Overseer</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here I will quote some words from some of the popes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The popes call themselves universal overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Originally, an overseer was an elder of a local church, and the elders of the local churches were called overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, one of the overseers became a bishop and ruled over other elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Still later, the bishops began to take control over other churches, and then eventually, over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the pope called himself the universal overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One of the popes said, I, the Pope, am the king of kings, and my laws precede all laws.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was the written declaration of a pope concerning his papal authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does this declaration sound like something that should come out of the mouth of one who follows the lowly Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Infallibility of the Pope</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Vatican Conference in 1870, a decree read, The Pope of Rome cannot change or improve on his own words.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Imagine how great the authority of Roman Catholicism has become!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Anything can be improved upon except the words of the pope of Rome!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His words are the supreme command and cannot be improved upon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What kind of spirit is behind these words?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Clearly, man s authority has usurped God s authority!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The above statement applies to all proclamations by any pope.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can find numerous claims similar to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One pope in Rome published a message called The Scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At first, Roman Catholicism believed that only the church was infallible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But this message extended this claim by telling everyone that not only was the church infallible, but the pope was infallible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The pope could not be wrong in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Chinese expression bu-neng-tzo-wu for infallible may not sound that strong in Chinese, but in Greek, Latin, and English infallible is a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only God is infallible, but Catholics say that the pope is infallible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is heresy and leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How God Sees Catholicism</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is God s attitude toward Catholicism?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Revelation 17 speaks of a great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She is not just an adulteress but a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To commit a moral sin after one is married is adultery, but to commit a moral sin without a marriage at all is harlotry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here the Bible calls Roman Catholicism a harlot.</S>
