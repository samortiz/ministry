   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament, Paul was the only apostle who used the expression the Body of Christ to denote the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other places in the New Testament, the church is called the temple of God, the household of God, etc. But Paul specifically said that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The subject here is not us becoming the sons of God or becoming Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are talking about how the church becomes the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can say that the church is Christ in a different form.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything that issues from Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church comes fully out of Christ and is one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need for a Christian to do anything or change anything in order to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as a man is regenerated, he is in Christ and becomes a part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING A MATTER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church as the Body of Christ is absolutely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church as the Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man cannot become a part of the Body of Christ just by understanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He becomes a part of the Body of Christ through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is absolutely a matter of life; it has nothing to do with knowledge or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As Christians we need very much to see the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the only way we can see the Body of Christ is by God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot understand the Body of Christ with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if we have all the knowledge there is about the Body of Christ, we still may not have seen the Body of Christ or touched the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only those who have received revelation from God will see the Body of Christ, and only they will enter the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 12 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ, but it does not explain how the church becomes the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to understand how the church becomes the Body of Christ, we have to understand Romans 5 through 8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter five tells us that all men are joined to Adam and that man derives his life from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through Adam's fall, all men have become sinners and have been joined to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Chapter six tells us that the old man has to be dealt with; it has to be crucified with Christ.</S>
