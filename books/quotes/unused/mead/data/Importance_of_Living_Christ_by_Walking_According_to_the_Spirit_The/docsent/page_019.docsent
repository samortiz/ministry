   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE LORD BEING THE UNIQUE CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK THE ELDERS AND SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NEEDING TO AVOID BEING A CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders and those who serve in the work of the ministry need to beware of the danger of becoming a center in their locality or in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A center is like the hub in a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the hub is removed, the rest of the wheel collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church in our locality or the area in which we work should not collapse or stop if we are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to realize that to be a center of the church or the work is to be a cancer to the Body of Christ, which will eventually bring death to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout the years I have seen much damage come in as a result of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy for those who receive help from us to make us a center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is also easy to make ourselves a center.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that within our fallen human nature is a tendency to like to be the center.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may say that we do not have an intention or desire to be a center, but our way of caring for the church or doing the work often builds us up as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Becoming a center is a danger especially for those who are useful in the hands of the Lord, because others tend to consider such ones as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not used much by the Lord, no one will consider us as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when we are useful, we become a magnet, drawing others to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are able to minister life to others and help them with their problems, we become very attractive to others; it seems that we become the life pulse of the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To attract others involves the flesh, regardless of the apparent purity of our intention or desire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The disciples of John the Baptist became jealous when they saw that many went to Jesus to be baptized John 3:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John said to them, You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom s voice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This joy of mine therefore is made full.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must increase, but I must decrease vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This case shows that those who are useful in the work for the Lord can easily become an attracting center.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John s disciples made him a center, but he tried to turn them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, because others made him a center, the Lord had to allow John to be put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ultimately, John was martyred, which terminated that center.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Corinthians said, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that they considered either Cephas or Apollos or Paul as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the record of the New Testament, Paul rendered much help to them, but he avoided being the center.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Apollos was not as useful as Paul, but Paul places himself on the same level as Apollos and makes God the center when he writes, I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 4:6 Paul again ranked himself with Apollos in order to avoid being the center.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This case also exposes the tendency for a useful one to become a center.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is the unique center in the work and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not make ourselves a center.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The work and the church should not be arranged around us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more useful and capable we are, the more difficult it is to avoid being a center.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we handle matters in a good way with a good result, our reputation will be built up, and many people and affairs will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to avoid becoming a center, we should often allow people and business affairs to go to other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A WORD OF CAUTION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many churches in the Lord s recovery began by meeting in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For instance, the church in Los Angeles began in Brother Samuel Chang s home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is scriptural for the church to meet in a home, but there are certain related dangers that we must avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We sometimes try to avoid having the church meetings in our home because it is troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we often like to have the church meetings in our home because it is the most effective way to fulfill our hidden desire to become a center in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the church meets in our home, we soon learn everything about the saints and become a hub of information.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the church meets in the home of a single brother, there is a great danger of sin because of the temptation of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In matters concerning the flesh, we should never trust ourselves or even think that the Lord s grace is sufficient to prevent us from falling into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must avoid the temptation altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the church meets in a married brother s home, his wife is a great protection from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, another danger arises because wives often maneuver to control matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is difficult for husbands to avoid being maneuvered by their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Wives also like to be the center.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The wives of brothers who are useful to the Lord in the work or the church often try to exert some control in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result, the wife of a brother who serves in the ministry or the church may become the source of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We who serve the Lord in the ministry or the church must be on the alert, first, not to allow ourselves to be the center, and second, not to allow our wives to maneuver matters related to our service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not need to fight against our wives, but we must realize that the wives should not be involved with our service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In American culture the wife always accompanies the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter and other apostles were married, but the New Testament does not record the names of their wives Matt 8:14; 1 Cor 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What the Bible does not say is often as meaningful as what it says.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The lengthy record of the Bible does not mention the name of even one of the apostles wives.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The physical descendants of the apostles are not mentioned either.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not know who the children of Peter were.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The New Testament tells us only of spiritual sons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Mark was a spiritual son to Peter 1 Pet 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul never married, but he had two spiritual sons Timothy and Titus 1 Tim 1:2; Titus 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the physical children of apostles were their successors, there would be no need for God s selection and predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We do not decide who will follow us in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The New Testament records the names of one couple who had the church meetings in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First Corinthians 16:19 says, Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church, which is in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When Aquila and Prisca lived in Ephesus, the church there met in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When they lived in Rome, the church there also met in their home Rom 16:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the New Testament does not indicate that Prisca did anything to maneuver the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is dangerous to allow our wife to be involved with the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not need to fight against our wife, but we need to keep our standing as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If our wife proposes much to us concerning the affairs of the church, we should allow her to speak in order to care for her.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, we must discern whether what she says is from the Lord in her spirit or from her self.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we do not exercise discernment and maintain our standing, we will suffer, and the work and the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>According to God s economy, the Bible does not allow females to be the head, but wives sometimes try to be the head through their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must avoid this, or the church and the work will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must love our wives and respect them to the uttermost, but in the church and the work we must be careful not to be maneuvered by them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When the church meets in a home, it is difficult for the wife of the host not to maneuver things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not easy for such a wife to go on properly, because the danger and the temptation for her to maneuver things are always present.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Few wives have the intention to maneuver, but regardless of their intention, they may damage the church through their maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Serving brothers becoming a center and their wives maneuvering are two very damaging things in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is difficult to overcome these two sources of damage, and we need to be careful to avoid them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we trust in ourselves, we are placing ourselves in great danger of falling into one of these problems.</S>
