   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The center of God s New Testament economy is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man Jesus, who brought our sins, our old man, the old creation, Satan, and the world to the cross and crucified them there.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His death solved every problem and released the divine life from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit; thus, when we believe in Him, He enters into our spirit to be our life and our everything, making us members of His Body, who are joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the Head, and we are the members who constitute the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the center of God s economy in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To have a part in this, all we need to do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our faith; this is what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sadly, among tens of thousands of Christians, only a handful are able to speak our Christian faith in such a succinct way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consequently, I hope that all the elders, co-workers, and full-timers will know this faith in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot simply tell people that we believe in Jesus; rather, we need to speak forth the kernel of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The kernel of the New Testament is that the Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, was crucified, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit and that He now enters into us to be our life, our person, and our everything and to mingle Himself with us, making us a part of the Body of Christ to express the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the New Testament ministry, which is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we read John 14 through 16 carefully, we will see the deep thought contained in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said to His disciples, If anyone loves Me,...My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, the Lord prayed for the believers: That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These words are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus said these words, He knew that Peter, John, and James had no way to apprehend them at that time but that when the Spirit of reality came, He would guide them into the reality of the truth 16:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John, in particular, wrote several Epistles addressing this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit of reality came, He found a person named Saul of Tarsus, who had been taught the law of the Old Testament under the great rabbi Gamaliel; this provided Saul with a thorough knowledge of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the Holy Spirit revealed to him the New Testament economy, that is, the kernel of the New Testament, the deepest portion in the New Testament concerning the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Colossians 1:25-26 Paul says, I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here you refers to the church; Paul received a stewardship for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word stewardship in Greek is translated elsewhere as economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that when God s economy came to Paul, it became a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He became a steward in the house of God with a stewardship to dispense God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, Paul continued by saying, To complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Prior to Paul, although the word of God existed, it had not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word of God was completed at the time of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Complete is a weighty word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word of God is the revelation of God, the holy Word of God spoken in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are twenty-seven books in the New Testament, of which fourteen, over half, are Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we were to take Paul s Epistles out of the New Testament, a great part would be missing, and we would not be able to see God s economy or the mystery of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fourteen Epistles of Paul form the kernel of the New Testament; they complete the word of God and fully reveal and fulfill the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The portion that Paul completed is spoken of in Colossians 1:26: The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The words Paul spoke revealed the mystery hidden in God from the ages and from the generations; this mystery is Christ in us, the hope of glory v. 27 . Christ in us is our life today, and He will be our hope of glory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is God s New Testament economy, that is, the faith that God has given us in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The apostles teaching is simply the content of the New Testament.</S>
