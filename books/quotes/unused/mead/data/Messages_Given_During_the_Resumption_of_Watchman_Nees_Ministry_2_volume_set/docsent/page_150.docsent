   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Accepting and Exercise of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people like to assume headship apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are busybodies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You cannot entrust authority to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Authority is received from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only after a person has received such authority can he execute it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only those who are willing to accept authority can execute authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Chief of Police has received a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is why he can execute his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one is born a Chief of Police; he has to receive the responsibility first, before he can execute his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must see the Head first, and we must first realize that He is behind us, before we can have the assurance to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have no interest in touching others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All those who are interested in touching others' affairs, who like to be the head, and who like to express opinions, have to be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not do this, all those who like to make a display of themselves will become the authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Body, it is wrong both to be free and to be autocratic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are spiritual and who are weighty before the Lord should rise up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not because we love to speak that we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we speak, we have to speak in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who by their natural disposition do not like to be involved with others and who do not like to speak should be strong to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who by their natural disposition like to touch others' affairs should be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we want is the coordination of the Body, and not the coordination of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The feet are not comely.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The head is comely.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why more people wear shoes than hats.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The stronger a member is in the Body, the more it can supply others.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to give a report concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For many days, we have been waiting before the Lord, inquiring of Him as to the way to go on in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We think that first we have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostles remained first in Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As far as our number is concerned, what we have is not enough to meet the need of the places along the coast.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The political situation in northern China is very unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At present, we have over thirty co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The number is not large.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not have other co-workers wait in their localities for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai.</S>
