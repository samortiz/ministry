<h2 class=head1>THE STONE WITH SEVEN EYES</h2><p>Let us first read Zechariah chapter three. Verse 9, which is a wonderful Bible verse, says, “For here is the stone that I have set before Joshua—upon one stone are seven eyes.” This is very interesting. Have you ever seen a stone with seven eyes? What does this mean? Suppose there is a piece of stone here that grows eyes that can see you. Such a piece of stone must be living. Therefore, the stone with eyes in this verse is a living stone. It is very interesting that the Bible does not put the word living in the record, yet we are able to discover it in our reading. How do we know that this stone is living? We know because it has eyes. It not only has eyes, it has seven eyes. In the Bible the number seven means completion intensified. This stone is not only living, but its livingness is sevenfold intensified.<p>There is a stone, and upon it are seven eyes. Who is this stone? The verse continues, saying, “I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.” This stone in God’s dealing hand is a stone that removes iniquities. The iniquities of God’s people were removed in one day. Who is this stone? “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29). This stone is the Lamb of God. Another verse that proves that this stone is the Lamb of God is Revelation 5:6. This verse says, “And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.” The Lamb has seven eyes. Therefore, the stone with seven eyes in Zechariah 3 is the Lamb with seven eyes in Revelation 5. The Lamb is Christ. Hence, this stone is Christ. Christ is living, Christ redeemed us from our sins, and Christ has seven eyes.<p>Since Christ is something living and something for redemption, why is He a stone? This stone is for the building. Matthew 21:42 says, “Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” The stone that the builders rejected is for the building as indicated by the builders’ original intention to use it.<p>Acts 4:12 says, “And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.” According to verse 11, this means that there is salvation in no one except the stone rejected by the builders. Those in Christianity often quote Acts 4:12 but ignore 4:11. This is because most Christian preachers preach salvation but not building. They preach about the Redeemer but not about the stone. Therefore, recently I released several messages telling people that our Savior is the Stone-Savior. Our Savior is a stone, and this stone is a living stone and a redeeming stone. He saves us not to bring us to heaven but to transform us, who are sinners made of clay, into stones with His stony nature and element. He is not bringing us to heaven. He is building us into the New Jerusalem. Hallelujah!<p>Ephesians 2:20-22 says, “Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.” The Lord Jesus has become the cornerstone for the building of the church.<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, “Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.” This passage clearly says that the Lord is the stone.
