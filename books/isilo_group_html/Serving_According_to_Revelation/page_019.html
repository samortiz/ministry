<h1 class="title">MIGRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 8:1, 4; 9:31; 11:19-23</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of migration. The Bible does not mention the word <em>migration,</em> but it does contain the fact of migration. The gospel of God has often been spread through the migration of the believers. In this sense, migration is scriptural.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING AND GOING</h2>
<p>The words <em>come</em> and <em>go</em> are frequently used in the New Testament. Receiving grace and serving the Lord depend on coming and going. The Lord first calls us to come, and then He commands us to go. We were once far off from God because our sins and the world kept us at a distance from Him. However, God in Christ has now called us to come near to Him. He is calling us to come to Him for rest, life, the living water, and salvation (Matt. 11:28; John 5:40; 10:10; 7:37). Receiving grace depends on coming to Him. The more we come to Him, the more grace we will receive.</p>
<p>After we have received grace by coming to the Lord, He commands us to go and preach the gospel to all the nations, to go and disciple all the nations, and to go and be His witnesses unto the uttermost part of the earth (Matt. 24:14; 28:19; Acts 1:8). We come to the Lord to draw near to Him and receive His grace, and we go to serve the Lord and be His witnesses. We should not come to receive His grace without going to be His witnesses. We cannot be Christians who come without being Christians who go. We cannot be half Christians.</p>
<p>In order to be complete Christians, we must be Christians who come and go. We first come to the Lord, and then we go and testify of Him. We first come to receive salvation, and we then go to preach salvation. We come by being forgiven of our sins, and we take grace with us when we go. We come by forsaking the earth, and we take heaven with us when we go. We come by forsaking people, and we take the Lord with us when we go. We are supplied when we come, but we supply others when we go. As coming-and-going Christians, we allow the Lord&rsquo;s grace to flow freely in and through us. This flow should not be hindered or stopped in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Instead of remaining in one place, Christians should move all over the earth. The Lord&rsquo;s will is that we continually move so that we can take His gospel to every place. Unless it is the Lord&rsquo;s special arrangement, we should not remain in a place for a long time. When we remain in a place for a long time, we hold back the gospel, and it does not spread to other places. If we would live before the Lord according to His will, we would not be able stay in one place for a long time. The Lord might want a brother to reside in Tainan for two years, and then He might lead the brother to reside in Taichung for a while. Perhaps the Lord wants a sister to reside in the western part of Taiwan for a period of time, and then He may want her to reside in the eastern part for a few years. The Lord may want another brother to continually move from place to place. If we love the Lord and live to Him, we will take the gospel with us wherever we go. This is the meaning of migration, and this way is scriptural. The Lord wants His gospel to reach every place on earth through our migration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MIGRATION IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>At the time of Pentecost many people were saved in Jerusalem (Acts 2:41). Although these new believers received multiplied grace while they met and served the Lord together, the Lord charged the disciples before His ascension to be His witnesses &ldquo;both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (1:8). The disciples were the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses when they remained in Jerusalem, but the gospel was not being preached in all Judea or Samaria, much less in the uttermost part of the earth. Therefore, the Lord allowed persecution to arise in Jerusalem so that the disciples would be forced to leave Jerusalem and would be scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria in order to preach the gospel and testify for Him (8:1, 4). As soon as there was persecution, the disciples could no longer stay in Jerusalem peacefully; they were forced to move.</p>
<p>Jerusalem can be compared to the center of a large pond, and persecution can be compared to a huge stone. The Lord allowed persecution to be thrown into Jerusalem, just like a huge stone is thrown into the center of a pond; as a result, waves spread outward from the center of the pond. The disciples, who were pushed out like the waves, were able to take the gospel to many places. Eventually, churches were established in numerous places, such as Judea, Galilee, Samaria, and even Antioch, a Gentile city (9:31; 11:19-23). These churches were not established by apostles, who were sent by the Lord; rather, they were raised up by the disciples, who were scattered from Jerusalem. The scattered disciples took the gospel wherever they went. A church was raised up when some in a locality received the gospel and were saved. Before Acts 13 all the churches apart from Jerusalem were formed in this way. The church in Rome was not an exception.</p>
<p>We cannot find a verse in the Bible that says an apostle established the church in Rome. However, we can infer from the clues in the Bible that the sojourners from Rome, who received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation at the time of Pentecost, took the gospel with them back to Rome and raised up the church (2:10). Hence, we can say that the church in Rome was raised up through the migration of the believers. These examples show that it is very easy to spread the gospel and raise up churches through the migration of the believers.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
