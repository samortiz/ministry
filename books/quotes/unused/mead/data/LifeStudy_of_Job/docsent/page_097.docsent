   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S DESIRE TO BRING JOB INTO ANOTHER REALM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Job was in the realm of building up something that was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was building up himself in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He thought that he was absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was proud of what he had built up, and he trusted in that and glorified himself in that.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was his robe to cover his entire being, and that was his crown to be his glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, Job was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God in His eternal economy has no desire to build up these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, He considers all these things as frustrations and intends to strip them away from us, consuming them bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When everything is stripped away, then you will see God, and He will attract you to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then you will have God's nature, life, element, essence, and even His being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will cause a metabolic change within you to transform you from the present form of your human being to another form, the form of the divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result of this transformation, you will be a person reflecting God, that is, expressing Him and dispensing Him to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was God's intention with Job, and this is His intention with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now you and God may be in two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God wants to transfer you from your present realm into His realm, not only to make you one with Him but even to make you a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose someone had tried to talk to Job about all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone had done this, Job might have said, "What are you talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have learned a lot about God from my forefathers, and I have been paying attention to what I have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet you say that I am in the wrong realm and that God intends to build up something of Himself in me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You speak to me about incarnation, regeneration, and transformation, but I do not know what any of these things mean."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Job simply did not have the capacity to receive such a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not have these terms in his spiritual dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle, the situation is the same with many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The divine revelation has been given, it has been written, and it has been interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, many believers have no understanding of the economy of God or of the divine dispensing according to the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may think that being a Christian is simply a matter of believing that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior, who shed His blood for our sins and who has saved us through His death; that the Holy Spirit is now with us to help us to behave ourselves well and to do good that God may be glorified; and that we will go to heaven when we die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who hold this concept of the Christian life may not realize that being a Christian also involves sanctification, transformation, conformation, the divine dispensing of the divine economy, and the New Jerusalem as the enlargement of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want to teach them about these matters, you must do so in a very gradual way, beginning with the most elementary things.</S>
