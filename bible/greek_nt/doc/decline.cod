           DECLENSION CODES FOR NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, PREPOSITIONS,
                       CONJUNCTIONS AND PARTICLES

        Derived from Perschbacher's "New Analytical Greek Lexicon"
            and abbreviated in a form similar to that found in
               Friberg's "Analytical Greek New Testament"

                          Maurice A. Robinson
                              1 July 1995

  The codes which follow reflect an original abridgment and correction
  of the parsing codes utilized in Wesley J. Perschbacher, _The New
  Analytical Greek Lexicon_ (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1990), which
  volume is itself an updated and corrected revision of the original
  _Analytical Greek Lexicon_ by Samuel Davidson (London: Samuel Bagster
  and Sons, 1859).

  The abbreviation system herein utilized, although developed
  independently, retains features similar to those found in Timothy and
  Barbara Friberg _The Analytical Greek New Testament_ (Grand Rapids:
  Baker, 1981), and can be used with ease by anyone familiar with with
  either the Davidson, Perschbacher, or Friberg volumes.

  Many non-verbal New Testament Greek forms (e.g., nouns, adjectives,
  conjunctions, prepositions, and particles) can be declined in more
  than one manner.  Following the example of Davidson and Perschbacher,
  the declensions given reflect only those forms which actually occur
  in the Greek New Testament.

  The present parsing list makes no claim to errorlessness; should the
  user discover any errors in either the parsing/declension codes or
  Strong's numbers while using the Online Bible, please inform the
  present editor c/o SEBTS, P.O.  Box 1889, Wake Forest, NC 27588.

  SEARCHING FOR WORDS USING THE PARSING CODES:

      All parsing and declension code information for the Online Bible
      Greek text is supplied in CAPITAL letters whereas the Greek text
      appears entirely in lower case letters.  The Online Bible search
      routine allows case-sensitive searching, so that one can easily
      use lower case to search for Greek words only (with or without 
      wildcards), and upper case to search by parsing or declension
      only (also with or without wildcards).  Using Boolean search
      captabilities, one can combine lower and upper case search
      requests to select specific Greek forms in association with
      specified parsing or declension information.

      Note that in order to search across hyphenated sections of the 
      declension parsing (e.g., for N-GSM), one must make a "phrase
      search" request, since the Online Bible disregards hyphens in its
      search routine.  Thus, to search for N-GSM, the request must be
      specific for either the phrase "N GSM" or "N-GSM".

      Note that, even though one could search for all the forms of 
      "logov" by "log*", or for all Genitive plural nouns by typing 
      "GPM | GPM | GPN", in order to link a word directly with its own 
      particular declension, a fully inclusive PHRASE SEARCH must be 
      requested which includes the preliminary part-of-speech 
      identifier (N-, A-, or V-) when appropriate.  E.g., to search for 
      all gentive plural forms of "logov", one must enter a phrase 
      search request for either "log* N-GPM | log* N-GPF | log* N-GPN" 
      or "log* N-GP*"

      Note that the Strong's numbers may also be judiciously utilized
      when making search requests to reduce the amount of time and
      space needed to otherwise frame such a request.  E.g., one
      equally could do a phrase search for all genitive plural forms of
      "logov" by "3056 & N-GPM | N-GPF | N-GPN" or "3056 & N-GP*".

      To search for phrases based solely on grammatical analysis (e.g.,
      for all prepositional phrases followed by an articular neuter
      genitive noun), one must use the wildcard (*) symbol before each
      requested parsing in a phrase search request (e.g., "* PREP *
      T-GSN * N-GSN").


  STRONG'S NUMBERS:

      For access to the lexical definitions of the root form of each 
      Greek word, the appropriate Strong's concordance number has been 
      added immediately following each Greek word. The definition of 
      that word can then be ascertained by following the normal Online
      Bible F4 key or definition function as found in English-language
      based texts.

      The user should be cautioned, however, that the Strong's numbers 
      utilized for the Greek New Testament are NOT always identical 
      with those used in coding the English version text.  The reason
      for this discrepancy is simple:  James Strong was attempting to
      help out the lay reader of the Authorized Version in assigning
      numbers to each unique word root form.  For some reason, he then
      decided that the user might be additionally aided if certain
      words (e.g., the verb "to be", or comparative and superlative
      forms of adjectives and adverbs) were further subdivided into
      uniquely-numbered forms; or, conversely, if frequent expressions
      comprising more than one word (e.g.  "ou mh") were subsumed under
      a single number, rather than giving the usual separate numbers to
      such forms.

      Thus, the Strong's apparatus -- well-suited as it may be for use 
      of the concordance he produced, as well as to aid the English
      reader who does not know Greek -- is quite confusing and
      detrimental to the student who might seek to use the same numbers
      for understanding the root forms of the Greek New Testament.

      In order to eliminate the various problems which would otherwise 
      arise from an incautious use of Strong's numbers as originally
      provided for the English Bible, the present Greek edition of the
      Online Bible has reduced the Strong's numbers considerably so as
      to guide the user directly to the root form of most Greek words,
      without adding in the extra step of having further to enquire via
      the lexicon as to the component or root forms of such words.

      This revision of the Strong's numbers for the Greek text of the 
      New Testament is not yet complete.  Future editions of the Online
      Bible Greek text will eventually bring all Strong's numbers into
      conformity with the principle of providing only the base root
      form for all Greek New Testament words.  The user's patience is
      requested during this period of development.


  ADDITIONAL NOTES:

      Declined proper nouns are not specifically identified as such;
         only indeclinable forms are so identified.

      It is ASSUMED that all Strong's numbers are correct; these have
         not all been verified, except in a few cases where errors were
         corrected during the process.

      Reflexive pronouns have the Person (1,2,3) attached, e.g. F-3DSF
         See "auth" in Perschbacher for further examples.

      "rmd" is the abbreviated numeral for 144,000.  This term has no
      Strong's number.  It therefore has been assigned three Strong's
      numbers, reflecting the individual Greek words which make up its
      component parts.
