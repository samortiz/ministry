The messages in this book, given in a conference in 1972 in Los Angeles, present mainly the life side of the kingdom. While some chapters touch the doctrinal and objective side, the primary burden is the life side. May these chapters cause the Lord's children to soberly consider their responsibility toward the kingdom and to aspire to live today in the reality of the kingdom by the divine life so that they may enter into the enjoyment of the kingdom in its manifestation with the Lord in the coming age.</P><P>Anaheim, California, U.S.A.
