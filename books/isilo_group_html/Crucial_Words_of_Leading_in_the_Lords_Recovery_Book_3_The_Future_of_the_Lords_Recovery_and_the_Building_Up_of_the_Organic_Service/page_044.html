IN TRUTH, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have been serving Him for more than fifty years. I have gained much experience during these years, but there are three items that are unresolved. First, how do we support the new believers so that we do not lose them after they are saved? Second, how should we cultivate them so that they will grow like young green sprouts? Third, how do we care for them? How do we care for a church when the number of saints increases from five thousand to ten thousand? It is simple to care for a small church with only thirty to fifty saints, but suppose the church in Taipei doubled its number from five thousand saints to ten thousand; how would we care for its administration? To support, cultivate, and administrate are three issues that need to be resolved.</p>
<p>If we follow the way of the world, we could support, cultivate, and administrate through organization, but the church is not an organization. We must therefore spend some time to consider these matters. According to our experience, supporting, cultivating, and administrating depend on all the saints. In other words, every brother and sister must exercise in the truth, in life, and in the church; then the new ones will spontaneously be supported, cultivated, and cared for. If we are unclear concerning the truth, do not have growth in life, and do not participate in the church life, the result of our leading people to be saved will be the abandonment of many babies along the roadside. When a family has a baby, the parents do not leave it for the grandmothers to raise. We cannot lead people to salvation and then rely on the full-timers or co-workers and elders to support, cultivate, and care for them. Even though children are burdensome and troublesome, God gave all mothers a particular love. If we can lead five people to salvation in a year, that is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy; however, we must support them after they are saved. All mothers put their children first. Regardless of how busy a mother is, she will care for her children. Spiritually, this matter depends on our level of life. In order to resolve how to support, cultivate, and provide care, we must stop expecting others to take care of things for us; rather, we must do them ourselves. Therefore, we must know the truth, grow in life, and have a normal church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Laboring to Pursue the Truth</h2>
<p>Most young women now receive a proper education. When they become mothers, they are able to educate their children. This principle also applies to us. We hope that all the brothers and sisters, including the co-workers and elders, would receive this word. We should not worry about how to support, cultivate, or administrate. Rather, we must pursue the truth, life, and the church. We need to labor in the truth; we should not be afraid of laboring on the truth. We must spend time in the truth. We should study the truth not only for the sake of our children but also for our own sake. Preaching the gospel requires labor&mdash;reading the Bible and studying the truth, including the Life-study messages. If a student does not labor, he will not get good grades at school.</p>
<p>In order to get into a good university, the young people in Taiwan all labor in their studies. Likewise, if we want to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, we must labor when we read the Bible. We cannot read the Bible as if we are reading a newspaper or a novel. We must spend the time to labor in and research the Bible by getting into every word. We should even study the genealogy in the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1. When I was young, I studied the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1. Based on my study, in 1938 I wrote an article called &ldquo;Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.&rdquo; That article shows that I did a thorough study of the Lord&rsquo;s genealogy. You too must put such labor into studying the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Grow in Life</h2>
<p>We must also grow in life. We should not be loose or indulge ourselves. Neither should we try to improve or reform ourselves. Self-improvement is of no use. We should always remember that we are not living for Jesus; we are living Christ. We must practice &ldquo;not I, but Christ.&rdquo; When something happens to us, we do not need to learn to be patient; instead, we should practice living in a way that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We must exercise being rooted in Christ in all things (Eph. 3:17; Col. 2:7). This is to exercise in life. This is like playing the piano; if we skip one day of practice, our playing will not improve. We must exercise to live Christ. We should exercise to say, &ldquo;I am a person in Christ; I must live in Christ, and I must be rooted in Christ.&rdquo; It does not matter what kind of attitude others have toward us or in what way they speak to us, we should always be rooted in Christ. Such an exercise to be in Christ is to be &ldquo;no longer I...but...Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; We must exercise in this way every day so that we grow in life. Then after we lead people to salvation, we will spontaneously help them to live Christ.</p>
<p>For the building up of the church, we must not merely be zealous to preach the gospel; we must also have the truth, life, and the church as our foundation. We should study the truth diligently, just like a student studies algebra and geometry. Then our foundation will enable us to teach our children. Simply encouraging the saints is not enough to build up the church. All the brothers and sisters must be rooted in the truth and in life. We must hold fast to these three things: the truth, life, and the church; we cannot let them go. Even though we encourage the saints to be crazy and thick-skinned when they preach the gospel, their being so must be in the truth and in life; otherwise, there will be problems. We must watch to see that the saints are clear concerning the truth, that they are strong in life, and that they have a normal church life. We must care for these matters, pursue them, and exercise to be in them. This is the only way for the service in the church to be long-lasting and for the church to spread.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
