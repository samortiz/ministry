In the Bible there is a record not only of the positive things concerning the church but also a record of the failures in the churches
All the failures come out of one source, and this source is Satan, who instigates the weak saints to cause all kinds of local problems
The failures are not in the universal church but in the local churches which have been contaminated by the things of their localities
The ground in Ananias and Sapphira that was the basis for Satan's deception of them was their desire to have a name
If we would avoid Satan's deception, we must reject, condemn, and abandon the position to be somebody in the church life
Acts 5:4 indicates that selling possessions and distributing them to others was not considered by the apostles a practice of legality
It would not have been sinful for them to keep their property or to keep the proceeds from the sale of the property
Later, when Peter was speaking to Sapphira, he said to her, 'Why was it agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord'?
The Holy Spirit in verse 3, God in verse 4, and the Lord in verse 9 are all one, especially in the experience of the believers
We should not think that the Spirit to whom Ananias and Sapphira lied was the Spirit in the heavens, the Spirit outside them
In God's governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age due to a certain sin
At the very beginning of the practice of the church life, there was a failure that seemed to be caused by different languages
Apparently the problem in the church at Jerusalem was a problem of language related to those who spoke Hebrew and those who spoke Greek
When they came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost, they were not able to speak Hebrew but spoke their native languages
Since the time of Babel, mankind has been divided into different races that have formed their own nations and kingdoms
In Philippians 3:2 Paul uses the word 'concision,' meaning 'mutilation'; it is a contemptuous term for circumcision
When the Apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, fleshly circumcision was no longer honorable but dishonorable
In Philippians 3:2 Paul was very bold, saying, 'Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision'
In nature they are unclean dogs, in behavior they are evil workers, and in religion they are the concision, people of shame
Paul certainly is very strong in charging the Philippians to beware of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision
In Galatians 2:3 and 4 Paul says, 'Not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised
The false brothers were the Judaizers who perverted the gospel of Christ by smuggling the ordinances of the law into the church
In order to maintain this freedom, Paul refused to have Titus circumcised or to yield in subjection to the Judaizers
Here, out of fear of those of the circumcision, Peter backslid to shrink from eating with the Gentile believers
It is almost incredible that Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel
Barnabas participated in Paul's first journey to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to raise up the Gentile churches
These were considered by the unbelieving Jews and even by the Jewish believers in Christ to be apostasy from Gods Old Testament dispensation
Paying their expenses refers to the cost of the offerings which a Nazarite had to pay for the completion of his purification
In order to do this, Paul had to enter into the temple and remain there with the Nazarites until the completion of the seven days of the vow
He went through with it, probably because of his Jewish background and because he was practicing his word in 1 Corinthians 9:20
The Jewish believers in Jerusalem had two practices: the old Judaic practice of Judaism and the practice of the semi-church life
Paul might have intended in going to Jerusalem to clear up the Judaic influence on the church there, but God knew that it was incurable
The church in Jerusalem was terminated so that its satanic mixture would no longer have any influence upon the believers
In Romans 14 Paul refers to the failure of the believers in judging one another in the matters of eating and observing days
Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him
If we cause any one of the believers to stumble by our doctrinal concepts, we break down, destroy, God's work of grace in him
All our judgments concerning eating and the keeping of days must be cast aside for the sake of God's work of grace in others
We must take care of the building up of the believers in life, not our concepts concerning eating and the keeping of days
Any dissension contrary to the apostles' teaching is divisive, and we must keep a watchful, discerning eye over it
According to Romans 16:17, we must turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching of the apostles
To teach differently is to teach things that differ from the apostles' teaching centered on Christ and the church
When the Lord's words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness
The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness-a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ
In saying that they were of Paul or of Apollos, the Corinthians were walking according to the fallen, natural man
Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthian believers, may be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other
Going to secular law and filing a lawsuit against a brother is a matter of claiming our rights and of not being willing to suffer loss
The reason we claim our rights is that instead of living by the mingled spirit, we live in the soul and in the flesh
The sequence is that first we have a soulish preference, then the lust of the flesh, and then the claiming of our rights
To deal with the situation, Paul must take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers
The Corinthians were actually examining Paul; they were investigating him to determine whether or not he was an apostle
They said he was crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints
Although Paul did not burden the Corinthians, some of them were saying that he was crafty and took them with guile
They said that Paul would not come himself but used Titus as a cover to indemnify himself while he hid behind the scene
We learn from Paul's experience that even though the saints may be honest, Satan is nonetheless crouching among them
An idol and a sacrifice to an idol are nothing , but behind them are the demons, who are abominable and hateful to God
Since demons are the reality of idols, so eating of sacrifices to idols makes the eaters their fellowshippers, their joint participants
If we participate in fellowship with demons, making ourselves one with them, we will provoke the Lord to jealousy
In verse 29 Paul goes on to say, 'For he who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body'
To fail to discern the Lord's body is to fail to make a distinction between the bread, which signifies the Lord's body, and common food
Paul's thought in using the expression 'the body' may include also the mystical Body of Christ in addition to the physical body of the Lord
Our participation in the Lord's table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit
Even the genuine gift of tongue-speaking should not be abused; that is, it should not be used too much in the church meetings
To encourage all to speak in tongues in the church meetings is not right; it is against the Apostle Paul's word
In chapter fifteen of 1 Corinthians Paul deals with the Corinthians' heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead
If there were no resurrection, God's New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God's eternal purpose would be nullified
Some believers thought that the Lord Jesus would be coming back soon, and therefore that it was not necessary for them to work
Seemingly, James's compromising with certain Old Testament practices was nearly the same as a part of the degradation of the church
James spoke absolutely for Jesus Christ, not for the Old Testament, and due to his speaking he was put to death
Because degradation kills the life of the church, cutting the root of the tree, it is more basic and vital than a failure
We need to be impressed with this as we consider the various aspects of the degradation of the church described in the New Testament
All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, just as a shadow is a figure of a person's body
The festivals, the new moons, the Sabbaths, and the regulations concerning eating and drinking all were shadows
Here Paul is asking the believers why they still subject themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society
These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible
If we read 1 Timothy 1 carefully, we shall realize that what was condemned by the apostle as different teachings was not altogether heresy
We should not ignore them, but if we are taking care of the apostles' teaching, they should not be the emphasis of our teaching
As in 1:3, to teach differently is to teach something that is different from the apostles' teaching focused on Christ and the church
Paul and his co-workers taught in a certain way, but some who were blinded with pride deliberately taught differently
These wranglings are carried on by men corrupted and depraved in mind and deprived, bereft, destitute, of the truth
The Greek word for 'deprived' implies that these are ones who once possessed the truth, but now it has been put away from them
The desire for material gain is another reason certain ones teach differently from the economy of God taught by the apostles
His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him
Among the churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul's ministry as recorded in Acts 19
The church in Ephesus received the gospel, the teaching, the edification, and the establishment from the ministry of the Apostle Paul
Those who turned away from Pauls ministry deviated from Gods complete revelation the center of which is Christ as the mystery in the saints
In 2 Timothy 2:18 Paul also says that by having misaimed concerning the truth, Hymenaeus and Philetus overthrew the faith of some
Those who bring in heresies as gangrene make people wooden and earthen vessels unto dishonor in the great house
In a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor'
The church should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a 'tree,' a lodge for birds, having its nature and function changed
Those who have a form of godliness but deny its power pretend to have godliness but reject the Spirit, which is the power of godliness
At that time many will not tolerate healthy teaching, teaching which is healthy in life and which ministers the supply of life
The itching ear that is turned away from the truth is the main factor of the worsening decline in the churches
A factious man is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions
In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected
Because such divisiveness is contagious, this rejection is for the church's profit that contact with the divisive one may be stopped
In verse 11 Paul speaks a severe word, saying that a factious man has been perverted, that he sins, and that he is self-condemned
One who has been perverted in this way is spoiled, damaged, destroyed, with respect to God's New Testament economy
Verse 26 continues For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins
For the Hebrew believers to shrink back to Judaism and offer again the sacrifice for sin would be to do something which God had terminated
It not only refers to what Christ has done and will do for us but also to Himself, who is able to save us to the uttermost
His wonderful person plus His splendid work is so great a salvation, a salvation which none of us should neglect
Literally, the Greek means to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways, to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared
In verse 23 John continues, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
Since the Son and the Father are one , to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father
To deny the Son here refers to the heresy that denies the deity of Christ, not confessing that the man Jesus is God
That which you heard from the beginning' is the Word of life, the eternal life which the believers heard from the beginning
Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, is to let the Word of eternal life abide in us
In so doing we abide both in the Son and in the Father, and we are not led astray by heretical teachings concerning Christ's person
The singular pronoun 'He' here, referring to both the Son and the Father in verse 24, indicates that the Son and the Father are one
To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
The heretical view of the Docetists was that Jesus Christ was not a real man, but simply appeared so; He was just a phantasm
Docetism was a characteristic feature of the first antichristian errorists whom John had in view here and in 2 John 7
In verse 7 John says that those who do not confess Jesus coming in the flesh are not only deceivers but also antichrists
The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their supposedly advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, had such a practice
It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father for our enjoyment and reality
We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically so that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life
We shall not have any contact with him or share in his heresy, heresy that is blasphemous to God and contagious like leprosy
John says clearly that we should not receive an antichrist, a false prophet, into our house, and we should not even say to him, 'Rejoice'!
John 9 and 10 say, 'I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us
In 2 John 9 the Cerinthian Gnostics took the lead to advance in doctrine beyond the teaching concerning Christ
In 3 John 9 is one who was under the influence of Gnostic heretical doctrine, loving to be first in the church
The problem of Gnostic doctrine was one of intellectual arrogance; the problem of loving to be first was one of self-exaltation in action
The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith , in which we believe for our common salvation
Literally, the Greek words translated 'crept in unnoticed' mean to get in by the side, or to slip in by a side door
Because they have gone in the way of Cain and poured themselves out in the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the rebellion of Korah
Those who follow the way of Cain are according to the flesh and envy God's true people because of their faithful testimony to God
Balaam knew that what he taught was against God's truth and against His people, and he knowingly taught it for gain
The rebellion of Korah was a rebellion against God's deputy authority in His government and His word spoken by His deputy
Now the second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord
We may work and labor for the Lord and we may be pure doctrinally and correct scripturally, yet not have the first love for the Lord
We may remain the same in everything else-in work, in labor, and in other things-but we are degraded because we have left our first love
The works of the Nicolaitans refer to a hierarchy among the saints in which some set themselves to rule over others
The word Nicolaitans is an equivalent of the Greek word nikolaitai the root of which is nikolaos composed of two Greek wordsniko and laos
In the New Testament God has returned to His original intention according to His economy in that He has made all believers in Christ priests
At the end of the initial church, even in the first century, the Nicolaitans intervened as the mediatorial class to spoil God's economy
According to church history, this became a system adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and was also retained by the Protestant churches
In the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity; all believers should be the priests of God
During the first three centuries, the church suffered a great deal as the Roman government tried its best to damage her
In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion
By being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world
In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said of the church in Pergamos, 'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is'
Because the church has entered into union with the world and has become worldly herself, she now dwells where Satan dwells-in the world
When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication
In Revelation 2:15 the Lord says, 'You also have those who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans'
The worldly and degraded church holds not only the teaching of Balaam but also the teaching of the Nicolaitans
The woman here is the very woman prophesied by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven into the fine flour
The apostate church teaches mysteries, but not the mysteries revealed in the New Testament concerning God's economy
Another aspect of the degradation of the church is that of having a name of being living but actually being dead
In Revelation 3:1 the Lord says, 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead'
The seven Spirits of God are for the church to be living intensely, and the seven stars are for her to be shining intensely
To the church in Ephesus, Christ is the One who holds the seven stars and walks in the midst of the seven lampstands
The woman in verse 4 is 'gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls,' the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built
The prostitute holds in her hand 'a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication'
In the age of eternity we shall enjoy the eternal life, and we shall be sons of God as the composition of the New Jerusalem
The meaning of 'overcome' in Revelation 21:7 differs from that in chapters two and three of Revelation, where it is used seven times
The sons of God will participate in all the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem, especially the enjoyment of the water of life
To say that everything begotten of God overcomes the world actually means that it is the regenerated human spirit that overcomes the world
We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world
John 5:5 goes on to say, 'And who is he who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God'?
Our believing that Jesus is the Son of God brings us into an organic union with the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
The word poneros denotes one who is pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious
The word ending with 'abides in you' strengthens the word 'you have overcome,' which was written in the previous verse to the young men
Many in the church life are strong young men who have overcome the evil one and who have the word of God abiding in them
You are out of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world'
These verses indicate that the overcomers in the church have also overcome the antichrists through the indwelling Christ
Among the antichrists, the strongest and greatest one will be the Antichrist, who will rise up during the last years of the church age
According to 1 John 4:3, the spirit which does not confess Jesus is not out of God, but is the spirit of antichrist
Those who are overcome are the false prophets , the antichrists, those who teach heresy concerning Christ's person
Satan as the evil spirit usurps fallen mankind and operates in evil persons, who are the components of his world system
The overcomers have overcome all the degradations of the degraded churches spoken of in Revelation 24 6 13 14 15 20 24 3115 20a and 175
In the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity, for all believers should be the priests of God
When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication
The seven Spirits of God are for the church to be living intensely, and the seven stars are for her to be shining intensely
Religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches
These are considered in the Bible a collective unit fighting the battle for God and bringing God's kingdom down to earth
Abel, who was the first martyr, the Apostles, and all the martyrs and deceased overcomers are waiting for the time of resurrection
A believer who is an overcomer and dies before the Lord Jesus comes back will be resurrected to be part of the man-child
The dead overcomers, the man-child within the woman, comprise the overcomers of both the Old Testament and the New Testament
The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers as mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17
From this we see that the manchild comprising the dead overcomers through all the generations will be raptured before the great tribulation
The living overcomers the firstfruit of Gods harvest will comprise only the New Testament overcomers who live until the Lords coming back
Of the two men in the field one is taken and the other is left and of the two women grinding at the mill one is taken and the other is left
Luke 2136 says that some believers will prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place and to stand before the Son of Man
The enemy, the Devil, in heaven must be cast down by the man-child, who will execute the Lord's judgment over him
All the overcomers, both the dead and the living, will be the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
The overcomers will also be the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against Antichrist and his armies
To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life
The 'fine linen, white and pure' qualifies the overcomers not only to attend the wedding feast but also to be in the armies
The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and destroy them
Those who will reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom are those who live in the reality of the kingdom today
These crowns include the crown of righteousness, the unfading crown of glory, the crown of life, and an incorruptible crown
The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
Such a reward will be awarded to the believers not according to the grace of the Lord, but according to His righteousness
Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved, laid up, for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord's second appearing
It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ
The incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race, is a reward in addition to salvation
With this prize in view, the apostle charged the believers to run the race so that they might obtain the reward
The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, while the others will rule over the nations
In the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will rule, have authority over, the nations and shepherd them
The overcomers will exercise the authority of Christ over the nations and rule them with Christ in the millennial kingdom
In the Lord's teaching about faithfulness in Luke 19:11-27, He indicates that the overcomers will rule over the nations
Verse 17 says, 'Well done, good slave; because you became faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities'
These verses indicate that the overcoming believers' reigning in the coming kingdom as a reward will differ in extent
Over' signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and 'many things' signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and in the church life they are living in the kingdom of God today
The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today
Today all believers are in the kingdom of God but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom
According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord
To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment
In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, 'Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God'
The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers
Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
Peter 111 says So shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God's eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ
The overcomers will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God to enter the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in Matthew 13
After the Lord Jesus comes back, these overcoming believers will participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
For God to glorify us means that the glory which has been sown into us saturates our whole being and is expressed through us
When our entire being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us
As the divine life grows within us, it saturates us with the divine element, and this element changes us metabolically
Glorification is the issue of transformation, and transformation is accomplished by the gradual and continuous growth in life
One day, when we reach our maturity, we shall be glorified and thereby brought into the full expression of the Triune God
The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified, for suffering increases the intensity of our glory
Eventually we all shall shine and be glorified but the intensity of our glory will depend on the amount of suffering we are willing to take
Certain believers who have received eternal life enjoy it to some extent; however, they do not enjoy it to the proper extent
To miss the enjoyment of the divine life in the coming kingdom is to miss the enjoyment of eternal life during that dispensation
In the manifestation of the kingdom, the overcoming believers will participate in the enjoyment of eternal life with the Lord Jesus
In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will enjoy the eternal life in a fuller way
For the overcomers to inherit eternal life in the millennium is to have their names remain in the book of life
The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them
The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book
All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life
The names of those who have lived an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life during the coming age of the kingdom
As a result of this judgment, they will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever'
When in the millennium the overcoming believers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father
As the overcomers participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, they will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus they persecuted the prophets before you'
It will depend on whether or not we keep ourselves under the killing of the cross, on whether we save our soul life in this age or lose it
The manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium will be the reward to the followers who remain under the killing of the cross
For this reason, God has set up a reward as an incentive so that we may enjoy Christ faithfully in this present age
The giving of the reward to the prophets and to the saints will occur after the resurrection and rapture of the saints
At the Lord's coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ
The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward because it will be given to us for our enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age
If we are faithful in the kingdom exercise today, we shall be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age
Based on Christs eternal redemption eternal salvation has been given to us freely and eternally according to Gods eternal selection of us
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas the kingdom reward is for our work after we are saved
We may not receive the kingdom reward even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve
He was not allowed to enter into the rest of the good land because of his failure at Meribah , but he will be with Christ in the kingdom
According to the context the work that remains must be that of gold silver and precious stones the product of faithful ministers of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul goes on to say, 'Do you not know that those who run in a race-course all run, but one receives the prize?
The name of God means God Himself, the name of the New Jerusalem means the city itself and the name of the Lord means the Lord Himself
The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom
In the foregoing messages we saw the failures in the churches, the degradation of the church, and the overcomers in the church
The word 'recover' means to obtain again something that has been lost, or to return something to a normal condition
We need to understand the recovery of the church in relation to God's intention and accomplishment and Satan's work of destruction
The New Testament also gives us a clear record of how God's enemy came in to destroy what God had accomplished
He is a purposeful God, and once He has made up His mind to do something, nothing can change His mind or stop Him
In order to understand the recovery of the church, we need to consider the history of the people of Israel in the Old Testament
The Old Testament is a book of types, and the greatest, all-inclusive type is the history of the people of Israel
Many Bible teachers apply the things which happened in the beginning of the history of the people of Israel to Christian experience today
As we shall see, the return of the children of Israel from their captivity typifies the recovery of the church
The children of Israel were in slavery in Egypt, but through the lamb of the Passover they were redeemed out from Pharaoh's usurpation
Mainly due to the failure of Solomon, the temple was destroyed, and the children of Israel were taken to Babylon as captives
As typified by the latter part of the history of the children of Israel, the recovery is from Babylon-the capturing and divisive ground
Negatively, to be recovered means to be brought out of Babylon; positively, it means to be brought up to Jerusalem
In type the meaning of Jerusalem is the ground of unity, and the meaning of Babylon is division, scattering, and captivity
At a certain time in church history, Babylonianism came into the church, destroyed it, and carried away its contents
If we see this, we shall have a clear view, an overall view, concerning the degradation of the church and the recovery of the church
The recovery of the church, therefore, involves a return from the capturing and divisive ground signified by Babylon
The recovery of the children of Israel was not only from Babylon but back to Jerusalem, the God-ordained unique ground
Jerusalem, therefore, was the center for God's people to worship Him, and this unique center preserved the unity of the people of God
That right was in God's hands; He alone could make that choice, and the people were to take His choice, the divine choice
For this reason, it was necessary for God's people in the Old Testament to be brought back to Jerusalem, the unique ground ordained by God
Those who went back to Jerusalem from Babylon brought with them all the vessels of the temple of God which had been captured to Babylon
The believers are not encouraged to eat Christ, to drink Christ, to feast with Christ, to enjoy Christ in full
His God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel which is in Jerusalem
Finally, the recovery of the church is typified in the Old Testament by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem
The church, therefore, is the fullness of Christ because Christ has been increased and enlarged into so many members
Because the temple has become the city, Revelation 21:22 tells us that there is no temple in the city of New Jerusalem
The city, then, eventually becomes the mutual building, the mutual habitation, of God and man, for God dwells in us and we dwell in God
If none of God's people had returned from Babylon to Jerusalem, there would have been no one to carry out Christ's first coming
There will be many Marys, Zechariahs, Elizabeths, Simeons, and Annas to prepare a base for Him to accomplish His second coming
In the foregoing message we saw that the recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity
A factious man is a sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions
It is not that we separate ourselves from other believers; it is that the sects and denominations separate us from the church life
If we are to share in the recovery of the church, we need to be separated from all the sects and denominations
Like Ezra, Nehemiah, and other faithful ones in the Old Testament, we need to leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem
The recovery of the church also requires that we cleanse ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor in the great housethe apostate Christendom
For this reason we cannot believe that the great house in 2 Timothy 220 refers to the church as the house of the living God in 1 Timothy 315
The great house is certainly not the house of the living God, which is the great mystery of godliness and also God manifest in the flesh
Just as many unclean birds lodge in the big tree, so in the great house there are vessels unto dishonor, wooden and earthen vessels
The word 'these' in verse 21 indicates that the genuine believers need to cleanse themselves from the dishonorable vessels
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
Those who go beyond in this way go beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ and thus deny the deity of Christ
The word 'begotten' is a particular expression used to describe the conception that had taken place in Mary's womb
In English we can differentiate the words beget and bear, using beget to refer to the male and bear to the female
In the first sixteen verses of Matthew 1, gennao, translated 'begot,' is used thirty-eight times with respect to males
When the Bible says, 'Abraham begot Isaac,' the word 'begot' includes both the father's generating and also the mother's delivery
The word begot used thirty-eight times in Matthew 1:2-16 comprises both the generating of the conception and the completing of the birth
The second fact is that the words begot and begotten in Matthew 1 comprise the delivery as well as the conception
Because He was born into a virgin, He took on humanity and was delivered out of that virgin to become the God-man
Jesus' is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Joshua , which means Jehovah the Savior, or, the salvation of Jehovah
According to verse 5, Babylon the Great is called 'The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth'
Outwardly Babylon the Great is clothed in purple and scarlet and is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls
Christendom may have the golden cup, but the contents of the cup are idolatry, fornication, and every kind of evil
He tells us, 'Come out of her, My people, that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not receive other plagues'
Since Babylon the Great is twofold, to come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon
We shall go on to cover the building of the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God, and the establishing of the kingdom life
We need to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truth concerning the person of the Triune God
The pure revelation of the Triune God in the Bible occupies a central position between the extremes of modalism and tritheism
The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying the twofoldness of the truth of the Trinity
The Bible, true to the principle of balance in God's creation, is balanced and in the center; it does not go to an extreme
Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time
Modalism claims that the revelation of the Son ended with the ascension and that after the ascension the Son ceased to exist
Modalism has gone too far, not believing in the coinherence and coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Isaiah 96 says that the Father is eternal Hebrews 112 and 73 indicate that the Son is eternal and Hebrews 914 speaks of the eternal Spirit
In order to be balanced, we need to emphasize both aspects of the Trinity-the aspect of the three and the aspect of the one
The terms are not explanatory, but only approximately correct, as must necessarily be the case with any attempt to define the Nature of God
Some have used sunlight as an illustration: the sun is the Father, the ray is the Son, and the shining is the Spirit
Another illustration is that of ice, water, and vapor, with these three respectively representing the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Such illustrations may be used for temporary help; however, they should not be pressed too far, or they will lead to error
In his heresy Cerinthus separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ
To deny any aspect of this truth is to deny something of what Christ is and thereby to follow the principle of antichrist
In verse 23 John goes on to say, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
Because the Son and the Father are one , to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father
In verse 23 to deny the Son refers to the heresy that denies the deity of Christ, not confessing that the man Jesus is God
We see that the discernment of spirits is based upon whether or not a spirit confesses that Jesus has come in the flesh
To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ's redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood
According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father
These deceivers are the liars, the false prophets, who deny that Jesus is God incarnate and in this way deny the deity of Christ
They deny the deity of Christ and claim that His death was simply a kind of martyrdom and that it is not redemptive
If there were no resurrection, God's New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God's eternal purpose would be nullified
In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, 'And if Christ has not been raised, then is our preaching vain; your faith also is vain'
Without the living Christ in resurrection, both the preaching of the gospel and our faith in it would be empty and void, having no reality
Literally, the Greek means to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways, to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared
In their apostasy, the false teachers denied both the Lord's person as the Master and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers
Literally, the Greek words translated 'crept in unnoticed' mean to get in by the side, or to slip in by a side door
Jude speaks of ungodly men who pervert the grace of God into licentiousness and deny our Master and Lord, Jesus Christ
The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ
As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become God's sons, members of Christ, and parts of the new man
The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith , in which we believe for our common salvation
Concerning the person and work of Christ, we must preach that Christ is God incarnated to be a God-man, that He is both divine and human
In the Gospel of John He is 'without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life'
The New Testament indicates that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word is the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Because of the influence of traditional teaching, we may think that only the Son of God, not the entire God, was incarnated
The New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it says that God was manifested in the flesh
John 1:18 tells us, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized
The gospel here is the full gospel, including the teachings concerning Christ and the church, as fully disclosed in the book of Romans
We should stand in the full gospel, that is, in the entire New Testament, not just in certain teachings or doctrines
The gospel of Christ not only has life; it also has the life power to subdue death, to conquer death, and to annul death
The recovery of the church also requires that we be recovered to the truth concerning the person and the dispensing of the Triune God
Dispensation is a translation of the Greek oikonomia, which is composed of two words: oikos, which means house, and nomos, which means law
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
In Matthew 28:19 there is one name for the divine Trinity-the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The Father's fullness is the Son's fullness, and the Father's life and nature are also the Son's life and nature
In verse 14 speaking of the Spirit of reality the Lord says He shall glorify Me for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you
All that the Father is and has is the Son's, and all that the Son is and has obtained has been received by the Spirit
In verses 14 and 15 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality 'shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you'
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us
Just as Christ is far above all and sits in the heavenlies , so also the church sits together with Him in the heavenlies
Just as Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth , so also the church participates in His authority
Today the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, and in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory
The two Christ and the church are thus mingled and joined as one with Christ being the inward content and the church the outward expression
As the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ'
The building up of the universal church is altogether on the clear revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God
On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality
Verse 12 says, 'For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church
According to the grammatical construction of verse 12, 'the building up of the Body of Christ' is 'the work of ministry'
Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ
The four special gifts in verse 11the apostles the prophets the evangelists and the shepherdteachersdo not build the Body of Christ directly
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is also a necessity for the practical oneness
To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is to arrive at the full building up of the Body of Christ
The word 'Head' in verse 15 indicates that our growth in life with Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head
The more the processed Triune God is dispensed into us, the more the divine element becomes our constituent to make us the one Body
When the Lord Jesus was in the flesh, His body was the tabernacle and temple of God, both of which are God's dwelling place
Whereas the body of Jesus that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak, the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful
What was raised up by the Lord in resurrection was not only His own body, but everyone who was joined to Him by faith
Today we are still within the 'three days,' because the Lord is still working for the building of His Body under the process of resurrection
A great part of the Lord's Body has been raised, but there are still some members of His Body who have not yet been raised
All the damage that the enemy does to the church simply gives the Lord the opportunity to enlarge His Body in resurrection
We shall see that not only the Lord Jesus Himself is prevailing but that the church, His Body, the temple, also is prevailing
Timothy 3:15 and 16 reveal that the church as the house of God is also the manifestation of God in the flesh-the mystery of godliness
God is manifested in the church, the Body of Christ and the house of the living God, as the enlarged, corporate expression in the flesh
The church as the house of God is the continuation, the enlargement, the increase, and the expansion of God manifested in the flesh
In the church God is manifested in the flesh in a wider way according to the New Testament principle of incarnation
When the authority of God's kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life
To have such a living is to establish the kingdom life as typified in the book of Nehemiah by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem
Having considered the recovery of the church, we shall begin in this message to cover the stages of the church
The church in Ephesus depicts the end of the stage of the initial church during the last part of the first century
To love the Lord in incorruptibility is to love Him in the regenerated and renewed spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit
If we would love the Lord in incorruptibility, we have to love the Lord according to everything revealed in Ephesians
We should not love the Lord in corruptibility; we should love Him in a pure way, in the way of incorruptibility that can stand forever
Now the second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord
Him' here refers to Christ, the Word, who was in the beginning, who was with God, who was God, and through whom everything came into being
If, like the church in Ephesus, we leave the first love toward Him, we certainly shall lose the enjoyment of Him as the tree of life
Although we have loved Him in the past and may love Him now, there is the danger that our love for the Lord Jesus might fade
If we have love, then we shall have the life symbolized by the tree of life and the light signified by the lampstand
Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered merely doctrines to teach our mind but food to nourish our spirit
Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again
In the church's degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life
The Lord promises to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the paradise of God as a reward
The eating of the tree of life not only was Gods original intention concerning man but it will also be the eternal issue of Gods redemption
All His redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as their portion for eternity
As we are waiting for this we have a miniature of the New Jerusalem todaythe church life where we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the tree of life
According to the epistle to the church at Ephesus, the tree of life will once again be the center of the paradise of God
In the coming age the New Jerusalem will be a composition of all the overcomers as the heavenly part of the millennium
The matter of eating the tree of life brings us back to the beginning, because at the beginning there was the tree of life
Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as the life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life
In this message we shall consider the stages of the church signified by the church in Smyrna and the church in Pergamos
Although no one can continue Christ's redemption, His sufferings must be completed by all His followers both individually and collectively
In Revelation 2:9 the Lord Jesus said that He knew 'the slander of those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan'
Because the church under the new covenant in Gods economy had no part in their religious practice the Judaizers slanderously criticized her
Behold, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation ten days'
When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy
He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine's welcoming her as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century
Because the church as a chaste bride is the spouse to Christ her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God
In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion
The church has been called out of the world and has been separated from the world to God for the fulfillment of His purpose
By being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world
The church must be a golden lampstand, the pure expression of the processed Triune God, and have no connections with the world
The church should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a 'tree,' a lodge for birds, having its nature and function changed
At that time, the mustard herb became a great tree-Christendom, the worldly church, the church married to the world
In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Pergamos, 'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is'
Because the church entered into union with the world and became worldly herself, she began to dwell where Satan dwells-in the world
When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication
In Revelation 2:15 the Lord went on to say, 'You also have those who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans'
The Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group of people who esteemed themselves higher than the common believers
The worldlier the church becomes, the greater is the need for some to stand up and testify and to maintain intimate fellowship with the Lord
The placing of the hidden manna in a golden pot signifies that the hidden Christ is concealed in the divine nature
They come into the intimacy of God's presence, and here in this divine intimacy they enjoy the hidden manna in God's nature
In this message we shall cover two further stages of the church, the stages signified by the church in Thyatira and the church in Sardis
In 219 the Lord says I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first
In the Catholic Church today there is a strong teaching concerning the building up of a religious organization with its hierarchy
Sound teachers of the Bible recognize that the Jezebel in Revelation 2:20 is the same woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33
The woman in Matthew 13 is the Jezebel in Revelation 2 and Jezebel becomes the great harlot who is called the great Babylon in Revelation 17
The principle of the deeds of the apostate church is to mix the heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people
She helps God's people to worship Him, but she does not do so in God's way; rather, she does it in her own heathen, pagan way
As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant Church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ
The Reformation was God's reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, signified by the degraded church in Thyatira
To the messenger of the church in Sardis the Lord says, 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead'
The things which remain' are the things lost and restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith and the open Bible
To overcome here means to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism
Speaking of those who have not defiled their garments, the Lord says, 'They shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy'
White garments here signify the walk and living which are unspotted by death and which will be approved by the Lord
In 3:4 the Lord promises that the living ones, those who have not defiled their garments, will walk with Him in white
Being clothed in white garments involves our experience of Christ as the second of the two garments needed by every Christian
The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them
In this message we shall cover the last two stages of the church signified by the church in Philadelphia and the church in Laodicea
According to history, no other Christians have kept the Lord's word as strictly as those in the church in Philadelphia
To deviate from the Lord's word is apostasy, and to denominate the church with any name other than the Lord's is spiritual fornication
The Lord promises the recovered church that He will keep her 'out of the hour of trial' because she has kept the word of His endurance
If she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord's recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone
The name of God and the name of the New Jerusalem written upon them will describe their nature and declare what they are
The name of God means God Himself, the name of the New Jerusalem means the city itself, and the name of the Lord means the Lord Himself
In the eyes of the Lord, the church in Laodicea is not only poor in the riches of Christ but also blind in genuine spiritual things
Because of the lack of the subjective experience of Christ, the degraded recovered church is naked in the eyes of the Lord
The degraded recovered church needs to pay a price for the gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve, which she desperately needs
The 'eyesalve' needed to 'anoint' their eyes must refer to the anointing Spirit , who is also the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit
Because the degraded recovered church has been distracted by the dead knowledge of letters she needs this kind of eyesalve for her blindness
If we are overcomers, when the Lord comes in the kingdom we shall have the special privilege of eating with Him
The first four churches eventually issued in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church
As a reaction to the apostate church, the reformed church came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered
Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God's eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after
All the members of the church are produced in the church age, that is, in the age between Christ's first coming and His coming back
They have been justified by God in Christ , and they have been reconciled to God , so they have been redeemed back to God
The perfecting of the New Testament overcomers is a matter of transformation through the subjective experience and enjoyment of Christ
The perfecting of the immature believers in the age of the millennium will be through the Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline
The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming but that he does not expect Him
The Lord will not cut the evil slave in pieces; rather, He will cast him off from the glory in which He Himself will be
Whenever a person believes in the Lord, he is put into an organic union with the Triune God so that he may enjoy Him
The overcomers will be called into the Lord's enjoyment, which will be in the glory, but the defeated ones will be put outside this glory
Both the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be a sign of suffering the Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline
The Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline is also illustrated by the case of the slothful slave in Matthew 25:24-30
In verses 26 through 30 we see that the one-talented one who was not faithful in using his gift is rebuked by the Lord and punished
Verse 30 says, 'Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'
After the millennium, they also will be components of the New Jerusalem in the second stage, that is, in the new heaven and the new earth
The proper church life today is the enjoyment of the eternal and divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God
Its consummation will be also in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God for eternity
