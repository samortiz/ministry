<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S NEED IN THE PRESENT AGE</h1>
<p>In the first six messages our fellowship will mainly be to gain spiritual understanding. The purpose of this fellowship is not to discuss certain matters or to set up a training but rather to provide an opportunity for us to come together and fellowship concerning the work and the service. I am also burdened to fellowship concerning the building up of the church, our spiritual pursuit, and the supply through the ministry of the word.</p>
<p>According to my disposition, I am inclined to labor for a long time in only one place. In relation to our disposition, regardless of how much we experience salvation, God does not intend to annul our disposition. This is the reason that Paul&rsquo;s Epistles have Paul&rsquo;s flavor and that John&rsquo;s Epistles have John&rsquo;s flavor. The writing of the apostles was out of the Holy Spirit, but it has their flavor. Even though we usually associate disposition with naturalness, the Lord does not intend to annul the disposition of the people who are in His hand. The Lord desires that man be mingled with Him and yet maintain the distinctiveness of man.</p>
<p>After I graduated from school, I worked in one company. Many of my schoolmates and friends encouraged me to look for a better job, but I did not want to change where I worked. I worked in the same company for six to seven years before I began to serve full time. I worked in only one place until I served the Lord full time. Likewise, wherever I served, I labored diligently; I did not move from place to place.</p>
<p>I was in northern China for a long time, but I labored only in one place&mdash;the church in Chefoo. The more I labored, the more work I saw that needed to be done. Then one day the Lord raised up circumstances that sent me to southern China. I then labored for a long time in the Shanghai and Nanking areas. Again, if not for the circumstances, it is possible that I would still be in Shanghai. The more I labored, the more I felt the need to labor, because there was much to be done. But God raised up circumstances that did not allow me to continue to labor there.</p>
<p>Under the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement, I had to travel back and forth between two or three different places. Even though I traveled from one place to another, the Lord rarely led me personally. Most of the time the Lord raised up circumstances that forced me to move, or the senior co-workers charged me to move. Hence, I always felt dissatisfied because I expected to stay in one place for a long time and concentrate my energy and strength to labor and build up a local church as a strong model.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POVERTY AND WEAKNESS OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE RESULT OF A SHORTAGE<br />
IN THE SUPPLY AND THE LEADING<br />
OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s arrangement in various circumstances over the years compelled me to travel often. I once fellowshipped with the responsible brothers that I hoped to remain in Taipei, and not travel for a long period, in order to build up a model, because the condition of our district meetings is not what it should be. This is mainly because of a shortage in the supply and the leading in the ministry of the word. It seems as if the church is a shell, and there is a shortage in content. Even though there are more than twenty district meetings, the content of these meetings needs to be enriched and strengthened. In a certain sense, they are more impoverished than before. Therefore, there is the need for a supply from the ministry.</p>
<p>In the past the elders in the church in Taipei were willing to receive my help. However, after they received the help, the result they worked out was different than what I envisioned. To illustrate, the brothers and sisters in Southeast Asia have a good recipe for breakfast pastries. But when we follow this recipe, the breakfast pastries that we make are raw and unattractive. This shows that it is one thing to have instructions, and it is another thing to have the skill to follow the instructions. For example, after hearing messages concerning the enjoyment of God, the brothers tried to lead the saints. Yet somehow their practice turned out to be different from what it was supposed to be. This is similar to the Chinese saying, &ldquo;He painted a tiger, but it turned out as a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is a large church with about two thousand saints in the meetings. The greatest shortage is that the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is poor and weak. The saints lack color and energy, but this is not because the brothers have made mistakes. It seems as if the saints have not eaten for days, or they do not receive adequate nutrition from their food. Undoubtedly, the saints are weak because they lack a supply from the ministry.</p>
<p>The elders, the responsible ones in the district meetings, and the full-time serving ones have tried their best, but there is still a lack. This is the reason that I want to stay in Taipei for an extended period. I would rather sacrifice the work in other places in order to remain here and work together with the elders. I do not want to merely give them instructions. I want to work together with them and guide them.</p>
<p>A church as large as the church in Taipei has many needs, but the brothers and sisters who serve in Taipei do not have the skills to meet these needs. It seems as if we are building a house without the proper skills. We have labored in Taipei for many years, but the result of our work is poor and weak. Even though we may not be blamed for the shortage of our work, we cannot deny that it is poor and weak.</p>
<p>I have considered this problem before the Lord from many angles. On the one hand, because I could not be here continually, there has been a lack but not a loss. On the other hand, my frequent travels overseas have deepened and broadened my spiritual insight. If I had not traveled all these years, my spiritual insight would not be as sharp as it is now. A person who stays in one place for a long time can see only a partial picture. If I had stayed in one place, my understanding would not be as deep as it is now. On the one hand, my absence was a lack, but on the other hand, my traveling has enabled me to have a broader view and a deeper and higher realization. I feel that this gain is worthwhile. Therefore, I want to fellowship my observations with you. You may not feel the same as I do, because we are looking at things from different angles. Nevertheless, I want to fellowship my impressions.</p>
<p>I am about to visit nearly every major city on every continent except Australia. A number of these cities do not have a church that we know of; nevertheless, I would like to visit these cities. Most of the cities have local churches.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
