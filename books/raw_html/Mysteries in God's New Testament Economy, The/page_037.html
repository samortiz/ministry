<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Cooperation Needed by the Law<br>of the Spirit of Life in God's Economy</H2><P>Finally, point number eight talks about the cooperation needed by the law of the Spirit of life in God's economy. First, we have to cease from our own struggling and striving. Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live." Our old man, the first husband (Rom. 7:2), has been crucified (Rom. 6:6). We do not belong to ourselves or live to the law anymore. We have become the wife of Christ and have become those who depend on Christ. Hence, it is no longer we who live. We should cease from all our struggling and striving. When we stop and let go of whatever we are holding onto, it is no longer we who live. Following that, in our living or our service, we go along spontaneously with the operation of the law of the Spirit of life in us, cooperating with it. Then the two, that is, the law and us, act as one man, the outward being in harmony with the inward (Gal. 5:16a, 25). We are neither working alone nor are we giving up working altogether. Rather, we are cooperating with the law of the Spirit of life within, fulfilling the demand of this law, going along with the operation of this law within, and spontaneously developing the capacity of this law. For this, we need to cooperate by prayer and by having a spirit of dependence, thus maintaining our fellowship with the Lord of life and the Lord of work (1 Thes. 5:17; Eph. 6:17-18). When we continue to live in the fellowship with this Lord, who is the Spirit of life within us and the law in the Body of Christ, we will have the genuine living and service of the Body of Christ. This will enable us to grow in life, to be filled with the gifts of life, and to develop the organic functions for the building up of the Body of Christ unto the fulfillment of God's New Testament economy.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 21, 1990)</P>
