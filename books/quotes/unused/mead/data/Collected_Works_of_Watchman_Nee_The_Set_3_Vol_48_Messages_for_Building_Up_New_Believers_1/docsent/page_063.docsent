   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What time should believers rise up every day?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A sister once put it well when she said, "How much a person loves the Lord can be judged primarily by the way he chooses between his bed and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you love your bed or the Lord more?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you love your bed more, you sleep a little longer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you love the Lord more, you rise up a little earlier."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She spoke these words more than thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet they are still fresh to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man must choose between his love for his bed and his love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more he loves the Lord, the more he will rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A Christian should rise up early because the early morning is the best time to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Except for those who are sick, all the brothers and sisters should rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, many sicknesses are not sicknesses at all.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not want to go to extremes; we advise sick brothers and sisters to sleep more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the healthy ones should get up as early as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best time to meet the Lord, to contact Him, and to fellowship with Him is early in the morning.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we want to receive spiritual nourishment and spiritual edification, and if we want to have spiritual fellowship and spiritual supply, we need to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we rise up late, the manna will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The early morning is the very time when God dispenses His spiritual food and holy fellowship to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whoever is late will not gather anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many children of God lead a sick life, not because they have spiritual problems, but because they rise up too late.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many children of God have no lack in consecration, zeal, or love, but they cannot live a normal Christian life because they rise up too late.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They rise up early as a rule to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Proverbs 26:14 says, "As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here it says that a slothful person in bed is like a door that turns upon its hinges.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The slothful keeps turning upon his bed; he cannot leave it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He turns to one side on his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then he turns to the other side on his bed.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some Christians spend the whole day on other matters and kneel down to read the Bible and pray only at night when they are about to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No wonder they are ineffective in their Bible reading, their prayer, and their fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They wake up too late in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him.</S>
