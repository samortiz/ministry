   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Willing to Be Broken</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for the elders to be coordinated, everyone must also be willing to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without brokenness, there is still no possibility of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person cannot assert himself, protect himself, and preserve himself, and at the same time coordinate with others properly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may be the best one in preaching, in administration, or in visitation, but even in your specialty, you have to learn to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are only good in administration without being broken, you will not be able to coordinate with those who can preach or who can visit others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may feel that without your administration, the preaching and visitation of others are of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others may feel that without their preaching, there is no way for those who can only administrate and visit to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To have such a feeling means that you are absolutely not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is to annul others and to exalt yourself, to set yourself up and to trample others underfoot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should say, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the Lord has granted me mercy and has given me a little gift of administration, the church still needs the speaking and the visitation."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another may say, "Perhaps the Lord has given me a little gift of speaking, but there is still the need of administration and visitation."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I may say, "Perhaps the Lord has given me a little gift of shepherding and visitation, but I deeply feel that without the brothers' administration and their supply in the Word, my visitation would be useless."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we say this, there will be the sense of brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the self is overturned, yet no one has forsaken his own portion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only after the elders are broken will they not argue when they discuss matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Any argument is a sign of unbrokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A broken elder has no argument; he knows in what order he is set.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He can speak out his feeling in a serious way, but after he speaks, if the leading elder continues with his decision, he is able to submit himself to it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not mean that you will not speak out your feeling when you accept the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nor does it mean that when you speak out your feeling you are not accepting authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone has to learn to have no arguments and to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The leading ones may make wrong decisions and wrong moves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if everyone would take this way, there will still be a coordination, and there will still be the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone is still fully one and in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All wrong decisions and wrong moves can easily be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because everyone is broken and is not insisting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once the leading one discovers that the decision is wrong, he should be able to say humbly, "Brothers, I am sorry that my decision was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us change it right away."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How beautiful this picture will be!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that the brothers would see that if we insist on anything in an unbroken spirit and atmosphere, even if what we insist on is right, we have to expect a considerable problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not saying that we should not insist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we have to learn to be broken, and even if we insist on something, we still have to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some brothers are not insisting, yet they are not broken at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My opinion may not get through in a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Subsequently, I will not insist.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But neither will I touch the matter or inquire about it any further; I will just let it go by.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember that this way of not insisting is the strongest protection and preservation of oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, all the time we must learn to be a broken person among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, this requires God's grace and the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be smitten by God before we can be a broken person.</S>
