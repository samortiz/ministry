        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING UNTO SONSHIP, BEING HOLY,<br />
AND BEING TO GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 shows that God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is for the believers to be unto sonship (v. 5), to be holy (v. 4), and to be to God (v. 5). These three items are related and are the central significance and purpose of God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being unto Sonship</h2>
<p>In the original Greek the emphasis of <em>unto sonship</em> in Ephesians 1:5 is not on being a son but on becoming sons who inherit the position and status associated with sonship. God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is to gain a group of people to be His sons with His sonship.</p>
<p>The Bible emphasizes two aspects of being sons: the aspect of life and the aspect of inheritance. Life makes a person a son, but a son might not inherit the birthright. Esau is an example. He was Isaac&rsquo;s son, but he did not inherit the birthright (Heb. 12:16). According to His plan, God wants a group of people not only to be His sons with His life but also to have His sonship in order to inherit everything that He is. Those who have a share in the church have God&rsquo;s life and are His sons. In addition, they will obtain the sonship and inherit everything of God. God has not only given Himself in His life to the believers; He is causing those who have the status of sons to gain everything of Him as their inheritance.</p>
<p>God has given us His life to make us His sons; that is, He has given Himself to us so that we may gain Him. Our relationship to Adam is an example. On the one hand, Adam died; on the other hand, he is still living. Everything of Adam is in his life, which was given to us. Therefore, Adam is still living on the earth today. Adam is living in his descendants, because his descendants inherited everything of Adam in his life. God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is to make a group of people His sons. God has given Himself in His life to us for us to inherit Him. We have received God&rsquo;s Son. John 1:12 and 13 say that as many as received God&rsquo;s Son, &ldquo;to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God.&rdquo; To be begotten of God is to receive God. All that God is, is in His life, and this life has been given to us.</p>
<p>Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God,&rdquo; and verse 17 says, &ldquo;If children, heirs also.&rdquo; Being sons is a matter of life, but being heirs is a matter of inheritance. God has made us His sons; hence, He has also made us His heirs to inherit all that He is and all things. This is a glorious matter. The God of glory has entered into us; hence, we are now His sons. However, we have not yet been manifested as His heirs. The world regards us as the scum of all things (1 Cor. 4:13). But in that day we will enter into the glory of God to inherit all that He is and all things. This is the sonship that God has given us.</p>
<p><em>Unto sonship</em> in Ephesians 1:5 means to become sons with the sonship. Being sons is a matter of life; obtaining the sonship is a matter of inheritance. Life enables us to gain God; inheritance enables us to enjoy God and everything that God has. This is what God determined to accomplish in His eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Holy</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says that God chose us in Christ to be holy. In Greek the emphasis here is on being holy rather than being clean. Those who translated the Bible into Chinese added the character for <em>clean</em> to make this a two-character expression. When <em>holy</em> and <em>clean</em> are put together, people have the incorrect concept that this verse refers to being clean. The Greek word does not have the meaning of cleanness but of separation. Someone who is holy is separated. Our concept concerning being holy must be changed from cleanness to separation. We should regard <em>holy</em> as a matter of separation, not of cleanness.</p>
<p>The Bible says that God is holy (Lev. 11:44-45; 1 Pet. 1:16). God is holy, distinct, and separate from everything else. God&rsquo;s heart is love, and His nature is holy. God&rsquo;s nature is His substance, which is holy. The nature of a wooden chair is wood, and the nature of an iron rod is iron. Similarly, God&rsquo;s nature is holy. This means that He is distinct and separate from everything else. He is different not only from the filthy things in us but also from the clean things in us. He is separate not only from the bad things in us but also from the good things in us. God&rsquo;s nature is symbolized by gold, which is distinct from everything else. God is different not only from filthy things but also from very clean things. God is separate not only from bad things but also from the best things. The Bible uses gold, which is distinct in nature from everything else, as a symbol of God&rsquo;s nature. Gold indicates that God&rsquo;s nature is distinct from the nature of all creation and separate from the nature of everything else. Because God is distinct and separate, He is holy.</p>
<p><em>Holiness</em> refers to God Himself, God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to make the church holy. In a superficial sense, this is to separate the church unto God. In the Old Testament sanctification refers to being separated unto God. There are thousands of oxen and sheep that belong to the world and are used by the world. When an ox or a sheep was brought to the altar of God and offered up to God, the ox or sheep was separated unto God and thus was sanctified. Likewise, God&rsquo;s plan to make the church holy is His separating the church from all things to Himself. In a deeper sense, however, God&rsquo;s plan to make the church holy is His mingling the church with Himself, that is, His making earthen men into men of gold. Whatever is earthen is common; whatever is gold is holy. We were originally earthen, that is, common, but God is making us gold, that is, holy.</p>
<p>There is a picture in Genesis 2. God formed man from the dust of the ground (v. 7) and placed this man of dust in front of the tree of life (v. 9) and by a river that issued in gold (v. 11). This indicates that through His life, God wants to change the man whom He created from the dust of the earth into gold. Therefore, at the end of Revelation, a &ldquo;man-city&rdquo; of pure gold appears; this is the holy city, New Jerusalem (21:10, 18). The wall of this city is jasper, the foundations of the wall are adorned with every precious stone, and the gates are pearls, but the city itself is pure gold, and the street of the city is pure gold (vv. 18-21). This indicates that when God&rsquo;s work is finished, the church will be pure gold, completely holy. At that time, the church will no longer be dust but will be transformed into gold; that is, the church will be completely of God&rsquo;s element.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, sanctification begins with separation and ends with transformation, a change in nature. When we were saved, God separated us from the world. But that was merely a beginning. Since the time of our salvation, God&rsquo;s life has been working to transform us. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being &ldquo;transformed into the same image.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s life in us is transforming us, changing our nature, until we are fully in His image.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 the man of dust, whom God made, could stand before God, but God had not yet entered into him; God was God, and man was man. But because God is in His believers and is transforming them, God is completely mingled with them as one by the end of Revelation, and they have God&rsquo;s element. They no longer have a nature of dust but a nature of gold. In the process of transformation we have God&rsquo;s life as a treasure that is of pure gold, but we are still earthen vessels outwardly (2 Cor. 4:7). Therefore, God&rsquo;s life must continue to transform us. In resurrection our outward earthen body will be the same as the Lord&rsquo;s body of glory. Then the church will be completely holy. Thus, the manifestation of the church, the ultimate and fullest city, is called the holy city (Rev. 21:2). Sanctification begins with separation and consummates with transformation.</p>
<p>We should have experiences of both aspects of sanctification. After we are saved, we are different from our relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates. But this is only a beginning. We must ask, &ldquo;Has my nature changed? Do I live and walk by myself or by God being mingled with me?&rdquo; Sanctification is not merely believers coming to serve God in the meetings in contrast to unbelievers, who go watch movies. We must ask, &ldquo;Do I come to serve God in the meetings by myself, or do I come by God transforming me and mingling with me?&rdquo; Even regarding speaking from the podium, we should ask, &ldquo;Am I speaking by myself, or is the Spirit of God transforming me and mingling with me in my speaking?&rdquo; If we are speaking by ourselves, without the transformation of the Holy Spirit, then at the most we have an outward kind of sanctification. We are not sanctified merely by not doing worldly things. Our being sanctified depends on whether we take care of the things of God by ourselves or by God transforming us and being mingled with us. Even when reading the Bible, we must ask, &ldquo;Am I reading by my clever mind, or am I letting the Spirit of God transform me and mingle with me in my reading?&rdquo; If we are reading by our clever mind, it is only an outward &ldquo;sanctification&rdquo; without inward transformation. The Holy Spirit must transform us and mingle with us in our reading. This is sanctification according to the inward aspect of transformation.</p>
<p>After we are saved, we have two natures. Hence, we should not be the only one speaking; the Lord should be mingling with us and speaking with us. We should not be the only one walking; the Lord should be mingling with us and walking with us. Whatever we do should not be done by ourselves; we should let the Lord mingle with us and transform us. Everything we do should be by the Lord&rsquo;s transformation and should cause His element to increase in us. This is sanctification according to the inward aspect of transformation. This is sanctification in our living, that is, an inward sanctification, a practical sanctification, and a completing sanctification. Such sanctification not only separates us outwardly but also transforms us, changes our inward nature. The coming holy city, New Jerusalem, will not only be separate and distinct from all things outwardly but also changed in nature inwardly. It will be gold in nature; it will not have an earthen nature. The New Jerusalem will be a completely transformed and sanctified city.</p>
<p>Most believers do not have this experience. Some brothers and sisters conduct themselves properly and are without fault in their interactions with others, but they still bear a common and earthen flavor. Their humility, gentleness, considerateness, and blamelessness have an earthen, human, and common flavor. The world may praise such people, but those with a spiritual sense know that such people are altogether earthen, not holy. Such people are good outwardly, but they are not changed in their nature to be holy inwardly; they do not let God&rsquo;s life transform them.</p>
<p>Someone who lets God&rsquo;s life transform him may not have any particular strengths, but when we contact him, we sense that he has the flavor of God. Something in him makes him an extraordinary and uncommon person, one who is distinct from everyone else. When we contact him, it is as if we are contacting God. This condition is called holiness. Such ones have been mingled with God and transformed by God. The extent to which a person lets God mingle with him and transform him inwardly is the extent to which he is holy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is for the church to arrive at the goal of sanctification, that is, for the church to be extraordinary, distinct from all else, and to be full of God&rsquo;s element. Then one day in the universe the church will be completely transformed by God to be a city of pure gold, in which all the elements are God Himself. This is to be holy. If we have this vision, we will realize that most Christians are earthen, common, and outside of God. The church must be absolutely holy and must not be mixed with any common element. The church is not the city of Babel, which was built of burned bricks (Gen. 11:2-4, 9). The church is the holy city, New Jerusalem, made of pure gold. Hence, we cannot use worldly methods, which are the earthly, earthen, or human methods, in our carrying out activities in the church, working in the church, administrating the church, or leading the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
