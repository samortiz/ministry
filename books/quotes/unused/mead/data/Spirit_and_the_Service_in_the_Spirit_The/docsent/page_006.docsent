   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO OUR SPIRIT HAVING BEEN DEADENED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND MADE ALIVE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:1-5; Col 2:13; John 1:14; 3:3, 6; 6:63; 14:16-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we saw that God wants man to serve Him in spirit and that only the service which is in spirit can enable man to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore God created man with a spirit by which man may serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FUNCTION OF OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit as the innermost part of man is the kernel of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man s being man lies in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man is not for the existence of the body or for the enjoyment of the soul but for the service of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The function of the spirit within man is to enable man to know God, serve God, contact God, and have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as man cannot contact God with the five senses of his body, neither can he touch God with the mind, emotion, and will of his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither the body nor the soul can get through to God; only the spirit of man can.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man can only contact and touch God in, through, and with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OUR SPIRIT HAVING BEEN DEADENED</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because man sinned and became fallen, the spirit in man became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Adam sinned, not only did it cause him to have a record of sin before God and to have the nature of sin within him, but it also caused the spirit in him to become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God told him that in the day he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he would surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after he ate of it, outwardly he did not die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though outwardly his body did not die and his outward man was still alive, the spirit within him was deadened and lost its fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, it lost its function and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From that time on, due to sin, the spirit in man was deadened to God and had lost its function with respect to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirit within man is deadened and deflated ; therefore, it has lost its function and its consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This may be compared to the deadness of the ears of someone who is deaf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A deaf person is not without ears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has ears, but his ears have lost their function and their sensation; thus, his ears have died.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today although there is a spirit in man, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally the spirit within man enabled him to sense and contact God, but now because the spirit has been deadened, it has lost its function and its sense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, it cannot sense or contact God, just as the ears of a deaf person are unable to sense or contact sound.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To a deaf person, it is as if there were no sound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, to a person whose spirit is dead, it is as if there were no God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, man s fall not only has caused the spirit of man to lose its sense and function and therefore become dead; it has even caused man not to realize or know that he has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man does not know how to use his spirit to contact God, nor is he even aware that he has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man only knows that he has a body and a soul with the mind, emotion, and will; he is not aware that he has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man realizes that he has a body to contact the physical things and a soul with the mind, emotion, and will to contact the psychological things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not realize, however, that he has a spirit to contact the spiritual things, the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because man does not know that he has a spirit, he basically does not use his spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, he is unable to contact God or sense God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consequently, he feels and thinks that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is similar to a blind person thinking that there are no colors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although colors exist, he cannot touch them with his hands, smell them with his nose, or hear them with his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In his sensation it is as if colors do not exist, because his faculty for perceiving colors has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, God does exist, but man does not sense God s existence because man is ignorant of the fact that he has a spirit and therefore fails to use the proper faculty, the spirit within him, to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spirit of man has lost its feeling and function, and it has become dead to such an extent that even its existence is not felt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is due to the fact that man has fallen into sin and lives in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the Bible says, You, though dead in your offenses and sins Eph 2:1 and You, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh Col 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sin causes the spirit of man to lose its feeling and function and to become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more one lives in sins, the more his spirit loses its sense and function and becomes more deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more one lives according to his flesh, the more he does not sense that he has a spirit.</S>
