   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Allowing Everyone to Have</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Full Opportunity to Serve the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One responsible brother once assigned some sisters to make some tablecloths.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the sisters tried for a few times, the brother was still not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the end, when he asked other sisters to help, no one dared to try it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet this brother could not do the work himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His disposition was too strong, and he had frightened others away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he would repent of his way, he may be able to gain one or two hundred brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord has been very much restricted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have offended the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should afford all the brothers and sisters full opportunity to serve the Lord, to offer up their possessions, and to give up everything they have for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything should be consecrated, whether it is the person or the things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do this, the church will become the Lord's blessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you assign a brother to do something, you have to first pray and consider much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, when you speak concerning it, your words have to be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The matter should first be discussed among a few people, and then presented to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In helping a brother, you should try your best to utilize his strong points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To perfect a person, we have to do it slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hong Kong is a gold mine, not in the literal sense, but as far as talents are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If someone would work there diligently, it would affect the whole of southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should pray that the Lord would use us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Shanghai is the center of the whole of China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Swatow is the center for Singapore and Ceylon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hong Kong is the international center.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our work today cannot be like that of traditional Christianity; we cannot have a pastor to take over everything any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, we should have every brother and sister rising up to work and to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perfecting Men for the Migration</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning migration, the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong can migrate to Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church in Chefoo, once over sixty people migrated west from Chefoo to Inner Mongolia and the Ningsia regions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their traveling expenses were all taken care of by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May the Lord change our view so that we can see clearly the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, if we are not proper ourselves, there is no way that we can perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If some have passed through some serious dealings in the basic matters, the work ahead will have a free course.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some works experience periodic revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But after the revivals, everything subsides again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Time and time again there are consecrations, but no essential personnel are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not produce fresh recruits, mere revivals are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this, you can see the crucial need of perfecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We left the denominations not only because they are wrong, but because they have not come up to God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there were the possibility of joining or uniting with them, there would not have been the need for another group.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is an absolute difference, rather than a relative difference, between them and us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some have asked if we can help the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My answer is that we are like a shopkeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If others ask the shopkeeper for help, he would say that he does not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He works every day from eight in the morning until night.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, we do not need to ask how the elders should deal with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who help others to work do so because they have no work of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our work today is not a scattered work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The question is not whether or not we can cooperate with others or help others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The question is whether or not we know what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person who does a scattered work is one who does not know what kind of ground he stands on or what work he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are engaged in serious work will not walk into another's office asking for help, for they know that others are busy also.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may say that the work of sweeping the streets and hauling fertilizer is low, but some people are doing this work also.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would not criticize others' work, nor would I oppose others' labor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, I know what my own responsibility is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are always people who will sweep the streets, and there are always people who will pick up the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today I cannot do something merely because it is a good thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others may say that this is good and that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is true that street-sweeping is good and that hauling fertilizer is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is the need for both.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the question is this: what does God want you to do?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Already I do not have enough time to speak what the Lord wants me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How can I find the time to oppose others' work?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not a question of opposing or cooperating, but a question of what we are doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>CONCERNING THE APPOINTING OF ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The elders are produced mainly not through appointment but through manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is a matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a person can do many things only after he has been appointed to be an elder and will not do anything if he is not appointed, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Can I appoint Mrs. Chow to be the mother of her four sons? And can I remove her from being a mother after a while? If you appoint her, she is a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you do not appoint her, she is still a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Her being a mother is not due to your appointment, but to her relationship in life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Who is an elderly person?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is something relative.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a certain brother is the most elderly among us and another person comes along who is thirteen years older than this one, naturally this second one is the more elderly one.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no question about this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The same is true with respect to spiritual maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you have maturity, you have it, and maturity will manifest itself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is best for the work of appointing the elders to be done by the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The same is true with the appointment of the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To serve the Lord is not a question of a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The main thing is that we put ourselves in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The most necessary thing for a servant of the Lord to have is absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>ON BEING A GENUINE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>IN ORDER TO SERVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I know people in the same way that Brother Cheng knows his trade silk embroidery.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The minute he touches a fabric, he knows what kind of material it is made of.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to be a genuine person.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You may have a hot temper, or a bad disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But even if you oppose and criticize, you have to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must be a genuine person if we are to serve the Lord.</S>
