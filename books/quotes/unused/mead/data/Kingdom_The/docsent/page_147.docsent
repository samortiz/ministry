   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MISSING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The situation is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians pay attention to many things, but neglect Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although they think they are clever, they really do not know what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The men who tested the Lord Jesus completely missed the mark, but the Lord Jesus knew what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they missed the mark, He never gave up His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even as He answered their foolish questions, He held on to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that the Lord Jesus will take advantage of any opportunity to reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may inquire foolishly, but the Lord will always answer wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our question may be wrong, but the Lord's reply will contain something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>REVEALING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As He answered all of the people who were testing Him, the Lord Jesus revealed Himself in an all-inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it was in a mysterious and hidden way because He revealed Himself through parables.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider the parable of the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a simple and hidden way the Lord Jesus revealed Himself as the Son of God and as the Heir of God's universal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also declared that He would be rejected and resurrected as the cornerstone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anyone who falls upon Him will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we had been there at the time with this vision, we would have realized the seriousness of His words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who tested the Lord Jesus were quite foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not realize the significance of what the Lord Jesus was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the all-inclusive seed sown in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus as the stone has three aspects: He is the cornerstone for the building of God, the church; He is the stumbling stone for the unbelieving Jews; and He is the smiting stone which, at His return from the heavens, will fall upon all the nations and break them into pieces Dan 2:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see that the Lord Jesus is the stone in these three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This seed is sown in Matthew and is developed throughout the remainder of the New Testament where all three aspects sprout, blossom, and reach the full harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 4:11 Peter said that Christ was the stone rejected by the builders and raised up in resurrection to be the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He repeated this in 1 Peter 2:6-8.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Ephesians 2:20 Paul also refers to Christ as the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Romans 9:32-33, Paul said that Christ had become the stumbling stone to the unbelieving Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Testament also develops the thought that Christ will smite the Gentile nations Rev 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How marvelous that in such a brief parable the Lord Jesus revealed Himself in so many aspects!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At least five points were mentioned: Christ is the Son of God, the Heir of God's inheritance, the cornerstone, the stumbling stone, and the smiting stone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a rich revelation of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The religious people asked Him, "Who gave you this authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus answered that He was the Son of God, the Heir of God's inheritance, the cornerstone, the stumbling stone, and the smiting stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What other authority did He need?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No authority could be higher than this.</S>
