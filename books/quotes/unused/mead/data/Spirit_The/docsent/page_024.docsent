   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Or if also he asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the life supply is indicated by the fish, the egg, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 5 it is indicated by the loaves of bread.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As God s sent One, He speaks the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He speaks for God, and He gives the Spirit to us without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that the Lord s speaking gives us the Spirit, that is, the Lord gives us the Spirit by speaking the words of God.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the flesh which profits nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What He would give is the Spirit who gives life, who is Himself in resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Flowing as Rivers</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord spoke concerning the Spirit in John 7:38-39, He said that the Spirit would flow out of our innermost being as rivers of living water.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>An advocate is one who takes care of legal cases like an attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is like an attorney who takes care of us and our case in a very careful, detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus was the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When He was about to die, He told the disciples that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter.</S>
