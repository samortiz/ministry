   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already pointed out that if we walk by the Spirit, we shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, if we walk by the Spirit, we shall be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we walk by the Spirit, we have the Lord s leading, even in such ordinary matters as the way we converse with others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul says in 5:18, But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law is related to our flesh Rom 7:5 , and our flesh is against the Spirit Gal 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the Spirit is in contrast to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we walk by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit, we shall not fulfill the lust of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are led by the Spirit, we are not under law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of life, not the law of letters, is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we walk by the Spirit, automatically we shall be no longer under the law, for the Spirit will lead us away from the law in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE WAR BETWEEN THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 5:17 Paul says, For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other, that you should not do those things which you desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse indicates that there is war between the flesh and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The flesh and the Spirit oppose each other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flesh lusts against the Spirit for its own desire, and the Spirit fights against the flesh for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE WORKS OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 5:19 Paul speaks of the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The flesh is the expression of the old Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fallen life of the old Adam is expressed practically in the flesh, and the works of the flesh, as listed in verses 19 through 21, are different aspects of such a fleshly expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, drunkenness, and carousings are related to the lust of the corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Enmities, strife, jealousy, angers, faction, divisions, parties, and envyings are related to the fallen soul, which is very close to the corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Idolatry and sorcery are related to the deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This proves that the three parts of our fallen being body, soul, and spirit are all involved with the evil flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The works of the flesh are arranged in different groups.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fornication, uncleanness, and sensuality are of one group, concerning evil passions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Idolatry and sorcery are a group, concerning demonic worship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Enmities, strife, jealousy, and angers are a group, concerning evil moods.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Faction, divisions, parties, and envyings are a group, concerning sects.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek word rendered parties in verse 20 means heresies, which refer to schools of opinion, sects Darby s New Translation .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Drunkenness and carousings are the last group, concerning dissipation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 5:21 Paul says that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not related to a believer s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in these verses will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What the flesh does is works without life; what the Spirit brings forth is fruit, full of life v. 22 . The fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit who is life within us, is listed here with only nine items as illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It has more items, including lowliness Eph 4:2; Phil 2:3 , compassion Phil 2:1 , godliness 2 Pet 1:6 , righteousness Rom 14:17; Eph 5:9 , holiness Eph 4:24; Luke 1:75 , purity Matt 5:8 , and other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both in Ephesians 4:2 and Colossians 3:12 lowliness is mentioned as a virtue other than meekness, which is listed here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Romans 14:17 righteousness, peace, and joy are all aspects of the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But only peace and joy, not righteousness, are listed here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Peter 1:5-7 godliness and endurance are counted with self-control and love as characteristics of spiritual growth, but they are not listed here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Matthew 5:5-9 righteousness, mercy, and purity are reckoned with meekness and peace as the condition of the reality of the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, these three virtues are not named here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the flesh is the expression of the old Adam, so the Spirit is the realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is actually lived out in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit listed here are the very characteristics of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have indicated that the fruit of the Spirit is full of life in contrast to the works of the flesh, which are without life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, the fruit is singular, the unique fruit of life, whereas the works are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are many works, but there is just one fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fruit of the Spirit includes the different expressions of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After listing nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, Paul declares that against such things there is no law v. 23 . Notice that Paul says such things, not these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Had he said these things, the fruit of the Spirit might be limited to the nine items listed in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the fact that Paul spoke of such things indicates that there are many more aspects than the nine he uses as illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul says that against such things there is no law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason for this is that the law condemns what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since none of the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit is evil, there is no law against this fruit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is necessary to differentiate between our natural virtues and those virtues which are the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One aspect of the fruit of the Spirit is love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before we received the divine life and were saved, we had the capacity to love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also knew a certain amount of joy, peace, longsuffering, and kindness, as well as the other virtues listed here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we came into the church life, we brought our natural virtues with us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that we brought our natural love, kindness, faithfulness, and meekness into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose a certain believer exercises his natural self-control to deal with a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yes, he manages to control himself, but this requires a great deal of effort.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His self-control is with the gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a great difference between this kind of self-control and that which is the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Natural attributes do not contain anything of God, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is filled with a spiritual substance which is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should remember that it is the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The substance, the element, of the fruit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What we need in the church life is a love full of the substance of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The element of the Spirit must also be found in our joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All these virtues should be the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since the Spirit is the realization of Christ, these virtues as various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are actually Christ s characteristics and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that to live out these virtues is to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The difference between natural attributes and the fruit of the Spirit is that the natural attributes do not have anything of the Spirit, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is full of the substance and element of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When a person lives according to his natural attributes or virtues, there is no need for him to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He may love others or exhibit self-control by the self and in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, if we would have the various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For this, our natural being avails nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we walk in the mingled Spirit, we live out Christ in different aspects, in all manner of spiritual attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I expect that the churches will be enriched in such a life and be uplifted through our living in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then in the church life there will be the different expressions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This was Paul s expectation in charging us to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we walk by the Spirit, we shall automatically defeat the flesh and the Devil lurking behind the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As we win the war against the flesh in this way, God s purpose to express Christ will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God s intention is that we live by the Spirit to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What we need in the Lord s recovery today is a walk by the Spirit to express Christ in many different virtues.</S>
