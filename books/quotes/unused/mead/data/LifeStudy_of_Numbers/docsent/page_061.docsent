This verse speaks of the adversary, the enemy, and being remembered before God.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; they shall be to you for remembrance before your God: I am Jehovah your God" v. 10 . This verse speaks of three kinds of occasions: the day of gladness, the appointed feasts, and the beginning of months.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In typology God pays much attention to the new moon, to the beginning of a new month; we, however, may not pay adequate attention to the matter of a new beginning daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The burnt offering signifies Christ as our acceptance by God and as our living; the peace offering signifies Christ as our peace and enjoyment with God.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that when we are absolute for God, there will be a day of gladness, a day for both God and us to have enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same principle, when we and God live in peace, remain in peace, and enjoy peace as a mutual fellowship, there will also be a great day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When in the church today God's children are absolute for Him and dwell together with God in peace, there will be a great day, a day worthy of blowing the trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The guidance for the children of Israel in their move was both from the heavens the cloud and from the earth the two trumpets .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the cloud moved, all the people received the sign to move.</S>
