   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Forty-four JUSTIFIED BY FAITH Scripture: Rom 3:22a, 28, 30; 5:1 The works of man fail The requirement of God s law is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In contrast, the works of man are imperfect and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore no one can be justified according to his own works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The redemption of Christ is sure The redemption of Christ is entirely according to the requirement of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ s redemption also satisfies the requirement of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus the redemption of Christ enables man to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Justified through faith Since the works of law are not dependable, but the redemption of Christ is so dependable and sure, justification must not depend upon man s works, but upon the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for man to depend on the redemption of Christ he must believe in Christ and His redemption; in other words, he must receive Christ and His redemption.</S>
