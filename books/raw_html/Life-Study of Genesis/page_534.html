<H2 CLASS=HEAD6>b) Offering Sacrifices to God at Beersheba<br>before Going to See Joseph</H2><P>Genesis 46:1 says, "And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac." In 35:1 God told Jacob to arise and go up to Bethel and to make an altar there unto God. But in 46:1 Jacob went to Beersheba to offer sacrifices on his own initiative. This verse does not say that he offered a sacrifice; it says that he "offered sacrifices." He went to Beersheba for the purpose of offering sacrifices to God. This verse does not tell us that Jacob prayed, praised, or gave thanks to God. Rather, it says that he offered sacrifices. He did so that he might have true fellowship with God. Using New Testament terms, Jacob offered for God's satisfaction the Christ he had experienced in many aspects. This is the worship God desires to receive from us. But this worship is related to our growth in life. When we are matured, we shall frequently worship God in this way. God did not ask Jacob to go to Beersheba and offer sacrifices. Jacob went there of his own accord to offer Christ for God's satisfaction.</P><P>The next verse says, "And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night." Notice that this verse does not speak of a vision, but of visions. During that night in Beersheba, God appeared to Jacob at least twice and spoke to him. When we are young in life, we often say, "Lord, what is Your mind? Please tell me what You want me to do." However, in chapter forty-six Jacob did not say this. Instead of asking God for guidance, he offered sacrifices for His satisfaction. Then, during the night, God appeared to him. Here we see the kind of fellowship a saint mature in life has with God. There is no praying, praising, giving of thanks, or seeking. Instead, there is the offering of Christ to God for God's satisfaction. In this kind of worship, Jacob had fellowship with God, and God appeared to him. This surely is another manifestation of Jacob's maturity.</P><P>We cannot imitate Jacob's degree of life. Our degree of life is always related to our growth in life. If we do not have the growth, we simply cannot have the degree. Although you may pretend, perform, or act, you still do not have the degree of life you are imitating. Therefore, we all need to grow. When we grow into a certain degree of life, spontaneously we shall have the manifestation of life related to that degree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>c) No Excitement Showing Looseness of Self<br>at Seeing Joseph</H2><P>Another sign of Jacob's maturity was that he displayed no excitement showing looseness of self at seeing Joseph (46:28-30). Jacob was not excited, because his heart had become numb. It is all right for young people to be excited, but there should be no looseness in their excitement. There must still be a certain amount of control. Sometimes my grandchildren are so loose in their excitement that they are destructive. One of them became so excited that he even walked on the furniture. Children who display such looseness need to be disciplined. Nevertheless, you young people must be excited, and the churches and halls filled with young people must be exciting places. You may even "raise the roof" with your excitement.</P><P>The more the young people are excited, the better it is; for the more excited they are, the faster they grow. I have never seen a numb child grow. Children need to be active and excited. This indicates that they are living, healthy, and normal. I enjoy the excitement of the young people because it is a sign of their normality. This assures me that they will grow. However, in your excitement there should not be any looseness or lawlessness. In the midst of your excitement, your spirit may say, "Be careful. Don't do too much or go too far." This control is right.</P><P>Young people, I encourage you to be excited. Although I am an old man, I do not like to be in an old people's meeting. I prefer to attend the young people's meeting and stay in a church filled with young people. Although they may not yet have transformation and maturity, they are living. The presence of life gives me the assurance that growth, transformation, and maturity will eventually follow.</P>
