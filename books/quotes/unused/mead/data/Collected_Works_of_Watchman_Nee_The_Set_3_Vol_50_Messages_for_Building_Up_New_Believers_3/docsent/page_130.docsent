   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She took the lead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please bear in mind that independence in thought is the first step toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man refuses to learn from God's appointed deputy authority and if he never presents things to God but cultivates his own independent thought, considering only what is pleasant to the eyes, what is good for food, and what is desirous to make one wise, he is rebelling not only against God but also against His appointed authority on the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 5 says that through one offense, condemnation came to all men v. 18 , and through the disobedience of one man, the many were constituted sinners v. 19 . Please bear in mind that in God's eyes, what happened in the garden of Eden was not only an offense but an act of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that there was only sin in the garden of Eden; there was disobedience as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin entered the world through the disobedience of one man.</S>
