   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LAMENTATIONS MESSAGE TWO THE THIRD LAMENTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A LAMENTATION OVER THE AFFLICTED PROPHET</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IDENTIFIED WITH HIS PUNISHED PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Lam 3</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will cover Jeremiah s third lamentation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a lamentation over the afflicted prophet identified with his punished people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Jeremiah himself was not afflicted by God, he was one with God s afflicted people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that a servant of the Lord must learn how to identify himself with God s people, regardless of the situation, and especially in a situation of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is afflicted because he is identified with God s afflicted people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us now consider this lamentation as a whole and then pay particular attention to verses 22 through 25.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. THE PROPHET S</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>REPRESENTING HIS PEOPLE S AFFLICTION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 1 through 20 are the prophet s representing his people s affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This affliction was by the rod of Jehovah s wrath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both the prophet s representing his people s strength and his hope in Jehovah had perished v. 18 . In verses 19 and 20 the prophet says, Remember my affliction and my wandering, / The wormwood and the gall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ My soul remembers them well / And is bowed down within me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The affliction described in all these verses did not happen personally to Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not afflict Jeremiah directly in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, because Jeremiah was one with God s afflicted people, in his feeling, in his sympathy, he was suffering the same kind of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PROPHET S</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>REPRESENTING HIS PEOPLE S HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verses 21 through 39 we see the prophet s representing his people s hope.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The prophet s hope was in the lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness of Jehovah, who was his portion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He hoped in Jehovah by waiting on Him and seeking after Him for His salvation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>25-30 , while depending on the Lord s doing and judging vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>31-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE PROPHET S REQUEST TO HIS PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verses 40 through 54 we have the prophet s request to his people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, he requests that they would examine their ways and turn again to Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he requests that they repent of their transgressions and rebellion that caused the Lord to cover Himself from them and to stir up their enemies to destroy them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>42-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE PROPHET S REPRESENTING HIS PEOPLE S</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>PRAYER TO JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, in verses 55 through 66 we have the prophet s representing his people s prayer to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He called upon His name that He would plead their case and judge their cause vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>55-62 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then he asked Him to avenge them of their enemies because of their evils vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>63-66 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although this lamentation bears an Old Testament flavor, it is nevertheless in the sphere of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is true especially of verses 22 through 25, which we will now consider in some detail.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lamentations 3:22 and 23 say, It is Jehovah s lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail; / They are new every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>/ Great is Your faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I believe that this word came to Jeremiah as he was contacting the Lord in the morning, reviewing all the afflictions of his people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While Jeremiah was reviewing these afflictions, he must have regretted the sinfulness of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At this juncture the word of Jehovah came to him, that no matter how much He had punished Israel, He had not utterly consumed them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jeremiah and many others remained.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was God s lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Realizing that he and all the others who remained with him were under God s compassions, Jeremiah praised, saying, For His compassions do not fail v. 22b . The people of Israel had failed, but God s compassions did not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His compassions had preserved the remnant of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Referring to Jehovah s compassions, Jeremiah went on to say, They are new every morning v. 23a . This indicates that Jeremiah contacted the Lord as the compassionate One every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was through his contact with the Lord that he received this word regarding His lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 23b Jeremiah declared, Great is Your faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s compassions do not fail, because He is the faithful One.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The faithfulness of God refers to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His faithfulness is also related to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because He had made a covenant with Abraham and confirmed it with Isaac and Jacob, God had to be faithful to keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God had spoken to Israel s forefathers, and He was faithful to keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verses 24 and 25 Jeremiah continued, saying from the depths of his being, Jehovah is my portion, says my soul; / Therefore I hope in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>/ Jehovah is good to those who wait on Him, / To the soul that seeks Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This word about Jehovah being our portion and about hoping in Him surely has a New Testament flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This indicates that as Jeremiah was writing verses 22 through 25, he was in the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Jeremiah enjoyed Jehovah as his portion, and he put his hope not in himself nor in the people nor in anything else but only in Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the one hand, Jeremiah realized that God is a God of lovingkindness, that He is compassionate, and that His word is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the other hand, Jeremiah realized that we still need to contact the Lord every morning, put our entire hope in Him, and wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Jeremiah s time, the situation of the people of Israel was not good.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It did not seem that God was so loving, kind, compassionate, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, it looked just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we are in a similar situation, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Like Jeremiah, we need to realize that God is still our portion and that we should hope in Him, wait on Him, and call upon His name v. 55 . However, even though we do these things, we should not expect the situation to change immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since there may be no immediate change, we need to continue to wait on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In Jeremiah s case, the waiting on the Lord has been quite long.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The fulfillment of his prophecies concerning the age of restoration has still not come.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the contrary, the situation of Israel today does not seem to be a confirmation of these prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This indicates that we need to learn the lesson of waiting on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today is not the time of the ultimate consummation; therefore, we must wait on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>With us there is the matter of time, the time element.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because we are in time, the time element is very important to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are conscious of the time element, and therefore we easily become impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But with our God there is no time element.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To wait on the Lord is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God is our portion; He is full of lovingkindness and compassion; and He is absolutely faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now we need to hope in Him, wait on Him, and call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, we should not expect that He will act quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A certain Bible teacher pointed out that God acted quickly in saving us, but in many other things He does not act quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>For example, we know that the Lord answers prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may pray to Him about a particular matter, but He may wait for several months before He answers our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This helps us to realize that our God is true, living, compassionate, and faithful, yet He often does not do things as quickly as we expect.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The reason God delays is that He intends to test us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He will test us to such an extent that we will lose our hope and feel that we are utterly finished.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When we feel that the situation is hopeless, that is often the time when God will come in. This is our experience under God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In verse 55 of this lamentation, Jeremiah said, I called upon Your name, O Jehovah v. 55a . In the Lord s recovery we have learned to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>However, many New Testament believers do not know about calling upon the name of the Lord and do not practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Some even criticize us for this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What an unfortunate situation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I appreciate the three matters we have emphasized in this message: to have our hope in the Lord, to wait on Him, and to call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we practice these things, we will be under God s dispensing in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When the situation around us seems to be hopeless, we need to realize that our God can never be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Whatever He has spoken, He will be faithful to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Therefore, we should believe all that the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In addition, we need to realize that God is the portion of His people, and we need to put our hope and our trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need to trust in Him and wait on Him whether He answers us now or later.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Even if He seemingly does not answer our prayer, we should continue to pray and wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The eventual result will be according to His purpose, and we will be the ones benefited by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May we all learn this lesson.</S>
