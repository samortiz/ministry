[1]  Words of Training for the New Way, Vol. 1 CONTENTS
[2]  In the New Testament not only does God reveal to us His New Testament economy, but He also shows us step by step the administration of that economy by means of both clear words and patterns of practice.
[3]  Unfortunately, due to the degradation of the church in the last two thousand years, the church followed after man s desires and became mixed with the world so that the clear revelation and pattern of the administration of God s New Testament economy became completely obscured.
[4]  However, every time we testify for God according to this mystery, there is a big conflict between us and Christianity over the matter of the church practice, that is, the matter of the administration of God s New Testament economy.
[5]  In Matthew 16:16, after Peter received the revelation from the Father to recognize Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus spoke to him, saying, And I also say to you...on this rock I will build My church v. 8 . The Lord Jesus shows us here that it is not enough to know Him as the Christ and the Son of the living God, but we also need to know the church which He will build on this rock.
[6]  After the apostles establish a local church, they appoint elders to take care of the church and to take the lead, and appoint deacons to serve and to handle business affairs in the church as well.
[7]  In 1 Timothy 5:19-20 the Apostle Paul charged Timothy, saying, Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.
[8]  Those who sin referring to the accused elders who have sinned reprove before all referring to the church that the rest also may be in fear.
[9]  We have already seen the basic principles of administration and finances in God s New Testament economy.
[10]  Following this, we need to know the beliefs in the Lord s recovery.
[11]  First, we believe that every word in the sixty-six books of the Bible is the divine speaking revealed by God.
[12]  Concerning the way of practice, the work, and the meetings in the Lord s recovery, we believe that the most effective way to preach the gospel, according to the revelation in the Bible, is to take the gospel directly into people s homes by door-to-door visitation so that they may believe and be baptized to belong to the Lord.
[13]  I hope that all the brothers and sisters serving in the ministry station realize what it is you are serving and what is the purpose of your service.
[14]  I often heard you pray in the meeting, saying, We need to follow the ministry, or We need to be one with the ministry.
[15]  Now we have already seen clearly that the ministry spoken of in the Bible does not refer to a person, but to God s building work.
[16]  Moreover, in God s building ministry, there are those who take the lead in that ministry in every age.
[17]  May the Lord open our eyes to see that as long as we are human beings, we should be Christians; as long as we are Christians, we should enter into the Lord s ministry in this age.
[18]  Today, we also need to be in God s building ministry to work out our own salvation, that is, to bring our salvation to its ultimate conclusion so that we can be exalted by God in glory as the Lord Jesus was.
[19]  Afterward, I began to understand that those brothers all wanted to do a work which was also for the Lord s recovery, but whenever Brother Nee had a certain leading, there were some who had other opinions so that it was difficult for Brother Nee to carry out the work in the Lord s recovery.
[20]  In 1949 I came to Taiwan due to the unstable situation in mainland China.
[21]  Before I came to Taiwan, southeast Asia was the only place overseas that had local churches, and the total number was less than one hundred.
[22]  When the Lord s recovery came to the United States, the things that attracted the American brothers the most were the truths and the life supply in the Lord s recovery.
[23]  We have already seen that the administration of the Lord s move on the earth began with the apostles and the apostles ministry.
[24]  Not only have we seen the light from the Bible, but we have also checked with the history of Christianity and our own sixty years of experience, especially the Lord s leading given to us in the last thirty years, along with the many admonitions and warnings we have received through our practice.
[25]  For this reason, the ministry station needs many more people to come to serve.
[26]  AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 20:22 EIGHT IMPORTANT TERMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[27]  THE LORD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT TO US
[28]  In such a profound book as the Gospel of John, the first verse of the first chapter says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[29]  However, in chapter 20, after the Lord Jesus had resurrected, He came into the midst of the disciples and did one thing.
[30]  No one would have thought that the Lord Jesus would not give a sermon, but would breathe into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit.
[31]  But the Bible says clearly that this God who is incomprehensible and mysterious is the Word.
[32]  CHAPTER FIVE THE VISION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 2:16; 3:6; 4:4, 11-12, 16; Col 1:18, 24; 3:15; Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:12-13, 18, 24-25; 10:17; 11:29 THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION
[33]  Beginning with this message, I hope that the Lord will grant us grace that we can see the Body of Christ.
[34]  Every one of us who is saved, especially every one who loves the Lord, follows the Lord, and learns to live to Him and serve Him, needs to see such a vision.
[35]  God s economy is God s administration, and God s administration is God s plan, arrangement, intention, and work.
[36]  Formerly, you could be a Christian in a locality with your door closed and not be bothered with the brothers and sisters in other places.
[37]  Today, however, for you to be a Christian, it is not sufficient to be a national Christian, nor even an international Christian; you need to be a universal Christian.
[38]  Three years ago when I came back to Taiwan to change the system, I had no intention of letting the American brothers know what I was doing.
[39]  Since we have seen the vision of the Body of Christ, we need to have our practice according to this vision.
[40]  We need to start practicing in small areas by first mingling with the brothers and sisters next to us.
[41]  Rather, it is my desire that you see the light, broaden your view, and realize that we are in God s eternal economy, that you would allow God to have the Body of Christ on the earth.
[42]  CHAPTER SIX THE VISION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13, 23; 2:16; 3:6 THE HOLY SPIRIT AS THE SEAL
[43]  The Holy Spirit being the seal means that, at the time of our believing, the Holy Spirit applies within us the seal, which is constituted of what God the Father is and what God the Son is, plus what God the Father has done, that is, His selection and predestination, along with the redemption that God the Son has accomplished, plus God the Spirit Himself.
[44]  The Holy Spirit applies this Triune God with all He is, all He has done, all He has attained, and all He has accomplished, as a seal within us so that all these can become our possession.
[45]  The redemption of our bodies implies that the Holy Spirit will have eliminated all the things within us that are of our natural constitution, of our self, of our flesh, and of our old creation, and will have sealed within us all the elements of the Triune God, having saturated and transformed our bodies.
[46]  Ephesians is a book on the Body of Christ.
[47]  Ephesians chapter one shows us how the church is produced, and Ephesians chapter two shows us what kind of people these were originally who have now become the glorious Body of Christ.
[48]  The salvation in Ephesians chapter two is different from that in the realization of many Christians, that after we believe in Jesus, God is gracious to us and saves us so that we will not go to hell, but go to heaven.
[49]  IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Matt 18:20; Acts 5:42; 20:7; 1 Cor 14:23a, 26; Heb 10:25
[50]  One is what I have shared with you in the past concerning the vision of the Body of Christ; the other is what I am going to share with you now concerning the way of meeting as revealed in the New Testament.
[51]  Concerning the proper way of meeting for believers, there are five passages in the New Testament that are the strongest and can afford us the practical help.
[52]  In the minds of most people, the highest and most genuine religion is Christianity because Christianity worships the true God and also because the Bible is the most superior book.
[53]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE KEY TO THE NEW TESTAMENT MEETINGS
[54]  Some of you brothers and sisters here were born in Christianity and were Christians there, some were born among us and have grown up in the churches of the Lord s recovery, and some were Gentiles originally who were saved and came into the churches of the Lord s recovery.
[55]  Today there are still many Christians who may have read the Bible for years, pursued the Lord diligently, or studied theology, and yet may nevertheless have difficulty pointing out what were the meetings among God s people in the Old Testament, and again what are the meetings among God s people in the New Testament.
[56]  But this morning, after so much experience, so much study, and so much consideration, I can stand before you to tell you in simple words that the meetings of God s people in the Old Testament were of the law, of the letter, and of knowledge; the meetings of us believers in the New Testament are of the Holy Spirit, of life, and of reality.
[57]  THE NEW TESTAMENT MEETING NOT REQUIRING TEACHING, BUT REQUIRING TRANSMISSION
[58]  Because the meetings of the Old Testament were of the law, of the letter, and of knowledge, there was a need for teaching, just like people attending schools need to be taught.
[59]  However, since the meetings of the New Testament are of the Holy Spirit, of life, and of reality, strictly speaking, there is no need of teaching.
[60]  First, Hebrews chapter eight tells us that God has put His new covenant, which is the law of life, in us so that we would know the Lord and would not need the teaching of the outward letter.
[61]  When we are filled in spirit, full of the Spirit, the four major factors for our meetings the word, the Spirit, singing, and praying will all become useful.
[62]  IN THE SPIRIT WITH THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18-19; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom 8:16; 12:11; 2 Tim 4:22; Matt 10:32; John 17:21
[63]  In the preceding message, I presented to you the matter of being filled in the spirit with the Triune God.
[64]  You may say that you bring the Triune God with you to knock on doors to preach the gospel; or you may also say that the Triune God brings you with Him to knock on doors to preach the gospel.
[65]  In Matthew 10:19-20, the Lord Jesus says, But when they deliver you up...it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.
[66]  The Triune God filling the redeemed tripartite persons is a matter of His heart s pleasure.
[67]  This pleasure of God is simply His desire, and it has become His will.
[68]  For the purpose of dispensing this Spirit into us, God in His creation of man particularly created a spirit for him that he might receive this God who is the Spirit by the spirit and with the spirit.
[69]  What I speak to you this morning may surprise you.
[70]  However, if you have some deeper knowledge of the Bible and have experience in the spiritual life, you will know that what I am transfusing into you is accurate.
[71]  Now I would use an illustration from the Bible to show you that matters of spiritual life are normal matters.
[72]  Romans 10:6 says, But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?
[73]  It is also the same with the matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[74]  The resurrected Christ as the reality of the filling of the Holy Spirit is within us, accompanying us day by day.
[75]  The Lord s word says clearly, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age Matt 28:20 .
[76]  CHAPTER ELEVEN PRACTICING SPEAKING THE LORD S WORD WITH OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 6:63; 7:38; Rom 10:8; Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16-17
[77]  According to my observation, for the most part your meeting this morning has been like a theatrical performance.
[78]  Those of you who have had meetings together with me can testify for me that in the past few decades, I have had the release of the spirit, pray-reading, and speaking in the meetings, but not once was there the flavor of a theatrical performance.
[79]  This morning, I would like you to see that our meetings, whether home meetings, small group meetings, or even large meetings, are a matter of speaking the Lord s word with the spirit.
[80]  First Corinthians 14:26 says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm...
[81]  Also, Colossians 3:16, the sister verse to Ephesians 5:19, says the same thing, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
[82]  In this morning s training meeting, I would like to fellowship these matters with you clearly.
[83]  You need to realize that the genuine Christian meeting according to God s New Testament economy is one where every believer uses the spirit to speak the Lord s word as soon as he arrives at the meeting.
[84]  If you want the meetings to be living and rich, they need to be full of the Lord s word, and the word must have the Spirit.
[85]  Therefore, fundamentally, Christian meetings should be full of the word of God, and the word of God should be filled with the mingled Spirit of God.
[86]  Our foremost brother, Watchman Nee, who brought the Lord s recovery to us, pointed out quite early in his messages that the Lord s Day morning message meeting is according to the customs of the nations; it is a waste, and we do not need to maintain it.
[87]  Fifty years ago, not only did I hear him say this, but I also discussed with him how to eliminate the Lord s Day message meeting.
[88]  I still remember him saying that 1 Corinthians 14:26 tells us clearly that when the whole church gathers together, it is not one person speaking and the rest listening, but each one has a hymn, or has a revelation, or has a teaching.
[89]  THE ISSUES AND MANIFESTATIONS OF THE FILLING AND OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[90]  The New Testament shows us that concerning the issues and manifestations of the filling and outpouring of the Spirit, only a small number of items are miraculous, such as tongue-speaking, healing, works of power, and predicting.
[91]  In Paul s Epistles, he did not encourage people to exercise these four kinds of gifts in the meeting.
[92]  On the contrary, he said in 1 Corinthians chapter fourteen that if there is one who wants to speak in tongues in the meeting, but there is no one to interpret, then that one should be silent vv.
