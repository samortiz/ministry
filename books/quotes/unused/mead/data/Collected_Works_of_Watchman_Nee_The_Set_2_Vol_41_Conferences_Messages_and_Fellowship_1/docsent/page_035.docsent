   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN WHAT IS FAITH Date: November 16, 1935, morning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Heb 11:1 FAITH BEING THE SUBSTANTIATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews 11:1 is the only verse in the Bible that gives a definition of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse tells us that faith is the substantiation of things hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Faith makes the things that are hoped for real.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is like the nose making smells real, the eyes making colors real, and the ears making sound real.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only faith can make spiritual things real.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Faith is spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without faith there is no spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A man may have eyes, but all the colors in the world will be invisible to him if he shuts his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same is true with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we do not exercise faith, we do not see anything spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we allow faith to make spiritual things real to us, all spiritual experiences become real.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many believers' prayers never reach God because their prayers are void of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only prayers that are out of faith will touch God, and only these prayers will bring in the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose a man has been blind for thirty years, never having seen a color in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once his eyes are opened, he will immediately see colors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord says that He is the vine and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we believe in this word, this word will become reality to us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a man exercises his eyes to see, things will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if he does not exercise his eyes to see, things will seem to be nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same is true with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Faith substantiates spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>FAITH REQUIRING REVELATION FROM GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faith is given to us when we are saved Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is like saying that a child is born with two eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man does not see, he can only blame himself for not seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His eyes are present, and they belong to him, but he can choose to see or not to see.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same way, as soon as we are saved, faith is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether or not we appropriate spiritual things depends on whether we exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people have faith already, yet they do not exercise their faith to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to ask God to show us a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's revelation can unlock our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation is like God lifting the veil and showing us what is behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I am hiding behind a veil, you will not know what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if you have faith, it will be as if you move beyond the veil and see everything that I am doing behind the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before we have faith, we can only vaguely comprehend the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot understand them clearly, because the veil is not yet lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, after we have faith, everything becomes real.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we have faith, we can say, "Now I know, because the veil has been removed."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past, we might have been veiled concerning some truths.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now the veil is lifted, and everything becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who has lifted the veil?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has lifted it through His revelations and has made all the spiritual things behind the veil real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE NEED TO BE HUNGRY FOR REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's revelation is His lifting of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition to believing, a man must be hungry if he is to receive any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only a hungry heart will receive God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A hungry heart is a desperate heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are desperate, we will see God's revelation as soon as it appears.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we come to this meeting only as spectators, we may gain many doctrines and even be able to analyze these doctrines clearly, but our analysis will only remain an analysis; it will not become our revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Doctrines will not make us see, and we will not gain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On God's side, He is willing to give us revelation, but on man's side, we must be thirsty and desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we take this attitude, we will receive revelation every time we read the Word or come to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a meeting it is easy to jot teachings down in our notebooks.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our minds may be filled with the knowledge, but if our hearts are not open to God, we will still not receive any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If our hearts are not open to the Lord, we will never gain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must pray humbly before the Lord, saying, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Break me!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Open my heart!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Under normal circumstances, salvation and victory occur at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This can be seen from the Israelites in the Old Testament, who ate the flesh of the lamb on the day that they struck the blood of the lamb on the side posts and the upper doorposts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The striking of the blood of the lamb was for their salvation, whereas the eating of the flesh of the lamb was for their empowering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should experience salvation and empowering at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unfortunately the condition of most Christians is abnormal today, and we find that we have to preach the overcoming life to them after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our preaching of the overcoming life today is a kind of make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Recently when I was conducting conferences elsewhere, some brothers and sisters complained that I did not preach this message earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We received the overcoming life at the time we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The victory that I am speaking of today is nothing more than a make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This lesson tells us that we are not just saved but are able to overcome.</S>
