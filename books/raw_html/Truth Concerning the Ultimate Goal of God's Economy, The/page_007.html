 <h2 class="head2">The Diamond in the Box</h2>
<p>We conclude this section with a reference to Brother Lee&rsquo;s illustration of the &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; in the &ldquo;box&rdquo; taken from the <em>Life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel</em> (pp. 203-204):</p>
<p class="indent1">God&rsquo;s intention is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead....Eventually, the whole Bible consummates with this matter. The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the Bible, involves God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, and God and man being mingled together to be one entity.</p>
<p class="indent1">If we read the Bible without paying attention to this crucial point, then, in a very real sense, the Bible is to us an empty book. This means that although the Bible is real in itself, in our understanding of it the Bible is empty. As an illustration, let us suppose that a certain box, which is quite attractive, contains a large diamond. A child may be interested in the box but not in the diamond. An adult, however, would focus his attention on the diamond contained in the box. Today, many Christians care for the Bible as the &ldquo;box,&rdquo; but they have not seen and do not appreciate the &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; which is the content of this box, and they may even condemn those who have a proper appreciation of the &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; in the &ldquo;box.&rdquo; The &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; in the &ldquo;box&rdquo; of the Bible is the revelation that in Christ God has become man in order that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p class="indent1">The vast majority of today&rsquo;s Christians neglect the crucial point in the Bible that in Christ God has become man in order to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead and that God desires to mingle Himself with man to be one entity. Some not only neglect this; they falsely accuse as heretical those who teach it. Today many believe one aspect of this crucial point&mdash;that God became a man named Jesus&mdash;but they do not believe the other aspect&mdash;that man is becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p>According to what J. S. says in &ldquo;The Worst Blasphemous Words...,&rdquo; he not only has an empty &ldquo;box&rdquo;; he even tries to use the &ldquo;box&rdquo; to deny the existence of the &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; and to condemn as heretical those who appreciate the &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; and who encourage others to treasure it, even as God does.</p>

<h1 class="title">MISREPRESENTATIONS IN TRANSLATION</h1>
<p>One subtle attempt to misrepresent Brother Lee is J. S.&rsquo;s use of the expression &ldquo;GOD BECAME MAN&mdash;MAN BECAME GOD&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p23-1.jpg" width="115" height="12" border="0" alt="" />). The original Chinese wording for this expression is &ldquo;God becoming man, man becoming God.&rdquo; This original expression in Chinese bears no reference to time and tense, yet the context of Brother Lee&rsquo;s speaking clearly indicates that Brother Lee means &ldquo;God becoming man, so that man may become God&rdquo; (from pages 38-39 of the book The Dispensing, Transformation, and Building of the Processed Divine Trinity in the Believers, <img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p23-2.jpg" width="282" height="12" border="0" alt="" />, given during the Chinese New Year, 1994. This book is only published in Chinese; J. S.&rsquo;s English quotation is supposedly a translation from the unedited taped message.) In fact, in the first line of stanza two of Brother Lee&rsquo;s new hymn, which J. S. quoted in his second quotation of Brother Lee (from pages 12-13 of the Chinese book The Highest Vision and the Reality of the Body of Christ, <img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p23-3.jpg" width="166" height="12" border="0" alt="" />, not yet published in English), it clearly says, &ldquo;God incarnated to be a God-man, in order that I can become God.&rdquo; Elsewhere in the same book, Brother Lee clearly points out that &ldquo;God becoming man, man becoming God&rdquo; means &ldquo;God became a man, so that man may become God&rdquo; (pp. 14, 23-28). This shows that J. S.&rsquo;s use of the expression &ldquo;GOD BECAME MAN&mdash;MAN BECAME GOD&rdquo; is clearly a deliberate misrepresentation of its Chinese meaning.</p>
<p>J. S.&rsquo;s quotation of the second message by Brother Lee in his article, in which we find the new hymn mentioned above, is not complete and fair. Immediately preceding the paragraphs which J. S. quoted, we find the following explanation, which J. S. did not quote:</p>
<p class="indent1">The expression &ldquo;God became a man in order that man may become God&rdquo; was spoken by Athanasius in the fourth century, around the time of the Nicene Council in A.D. 325. At that time he was a young, unnoticed theologian. His word became a famous word in church history. As time went on, Christianity did not talk about this and did not dare to mention it anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indent1">God is God, and He has begotten us to be His children. What is begotten is always the same as the begetter. A goat begets a goat. You cannot say that the mother goat is a goat but that the young goat is not a goat. God has begotten us; we are God&rsquo;s children. First John 3 says that God will work on us until we will be the same as He in every way (v. 2). This was God&rsquo;s intention from the day He created man. He created man, yet the man He created had the image of God. Adam was created in God&rsquo;s image and with His likeness. After man was created, God placed the tree of life in front of him, in order that this man, who had God&rsquo;s image, might receive God into him to be his life. In the end, if these ones who have received God into them to be their life are not God, what are they? Of course, the Lord shows us clearly that we are God only in life and nature. If a father begets a son, the son must necessarily be the same as the father in life and nature. But suppose the father is an emperor. We cannot say that all his children are emperors. The children only bear the life and nature of the father; they do not have the person of the father. God does this in order to produce a Body for Christ, that is, to produce an organism for the Triune God. The ultimate expression of this is the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It is clear from the above explanation that Brother Lee teaches that believers are the same as God only in His life and nature; they do not have any share in His Godhead.</p>
<p>The use of the word occult (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p24-1.jpg" width="26" height="12" border="0" alt="" />) as an alternate translation of the word mystical in describing God&rsquo;s economy (p. 1, &ldquo;The Worst Blasphemous Words of Witness Lee against God&rdquo;) is obviously another attempt to misrepresent Brother Lee. The word in Chinese bears no connotation of anything evil or cultic, as the translator would have readers to believe by the insertion of the word occult.</p>
<p>The use of the words mixed up (p. 2, line 1 of the same article) is another misrepresentation. The original Chinese expression (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-1.jpg" width="13" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), which appeared in the taped message only, merely means the two (God and man) being involved with one another.</p>
<p>Other instances of outright error in translation are as follows: &ldquo;God as well as man, man as well as God&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-2.jpg" width="115" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is translated &ldquo;God who became man, and man who became God&rdquo; (p. 2, lines 19-21, 25-26; p. 3, lines 6-7). (Incidentally, the same expression is translated by the same translator as &ldquo;God and man, man and God&rdquo; on p. 2, line 16 of the same article.) &ldquo;God, who mingled Himself with man as one&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-3.jpg" width="115" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is translated as &ldquo;God who mingled Himself with man to became [sic] a human body&rdquo; (p. 2, lines 24-25). &ldquo;A man in the new creation, constituted of the God-man and man-God&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-4.jpg" width="231" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is translated as &ldquo;a building of a new man, who is God becoming man and man becoming God&rdquo; (p. 3, lines 5-7). &ldquo;Man&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-5.jpg" width="16" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is translated as &ldquo;Man-God&rdquo; (p. 3, line 8).</p>
<p>We find many other errors in the very poor and flawed English translation of the above-mentioned hymn by Brother Lee. &ldquo;Having no share in His Godhead&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-6.jpg" width="102" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is rendered &ldquo;only His deity I have no part&rdquo; (stanza 2, line 2). &ldquo;His attributes become my virtues&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-7.jpg" width="102" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is rendered &ldquo;His own nature becomes my virtues&rdquo; (stanza 2, line 3). It seems the translator has trouble differentiating between deity and Godhead, and between nature and attributes. The most glaring mistakes lie in stanza 3 of the same hymn, where &ldquo;Coordinated with the saints in God to be built up as the universal house of the Trinity&rdquo; (<img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p25-8.jpg" width="218" height="12" border="0" alt="" />), is rendered &ldquo;I also coordinate with all the holy Gods to build up the triune universal family&rdquo; (stanza 3, lines 2-3). It is clear that the translator either does not have a full grasp of the Chinese language or is attempting to say that Brother Lee calls the believers &ldquo;holy Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should also be noted that all the boldfacing in &ldquo;The Worst Blasphemous Words...&rdquo; is supplied by J. S.; it is not in the original text, and its implied emphasis is the innovation of J. S.</p>
<p style="text-align:right"><em>Andrew Yu</em></p>
<p>The original hymn, written by Brother Lee in Chinese and referred to above, follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0870838148_chinese/p26.jpg" width="388" height="350" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<h1 class="title">A HISTORICAL SURVEY</h1>
<p>J. S. asserts, &ldquo;To use this verse [Psalm 82:6] to teach that we can become gods (whether with big or small &ldquo;G&rdquo; does not make any difference) is to perverse [meaning &lsquo;pervert&rsquo;?] the word of God and to teach the greatest and worst blasphemous heresy.&rdquo; Concerning John 10:34, he also claims, &ldquo;It is altogether nonsense and darkness to use this portion of the scriptures to teach people and to support the heresy that men can become God.&rdquo; In so claiming, J. S. wishes to argue against Witness Lee&rsquo;s recent ministry that in God&rsquo;s salvation man becomes God. Unfortunately, however, Brother Lee does not use these particular verses to demonstrate this matter. Thus, J. S.&rsquo;s response to this aspect of Brother Lee&rsquo;s teaching does not address the actual scriptural basis used by Brother Lee. In the first section of this book we have provided a compilation of Brother Lee&rsquo;s ministry on this matter, and there it is obvious what scriptural basis he has used. What J. S. does address is a major scriptural basis for the same teaching&mdash;that in God&rsquo;s salvation man becomes God&mdash;held by the early church of the first through fifth centuries. Hence, J. S.&rsquo;s attack is not merely against Witness Lee but also against the early church. Further, because large segments of the Christian community today accept this teaching as that which has been handed down from the early church, J. S.&rsquo;s words are to be taken as against them as well. We find ourselves, then, defending this teaching not only as presented by Witness Lee alone but also as first produced by the early church and held by a large portion of the community of believers today. This we feel should be done.</p>
<p>We cannot be certain of the motivation for J. S.&rsquo;s complaints. On the one hand, it appears that his charges are propelled primarily by ignorance&mdash;ignorance (1) of the historical standing of this teaching, (2) of the proper and accepted enunciation of this teaching, and (3) of the acceptance of this teaching today by large segments of the Christian community. On the other hand, we have demonstrated in the second section of this book that there is malice involved in J. S.&rsquo;s presentation, and thus our suspicion against ignorance on his part gains even greater credence. At any rate, ignorance, whether actual or feigned, is the chief characteristic of J. S.&rsquo;s polemic, and this ignorance can best be dispelled by a presentation of the three points mentioned above.</p>
