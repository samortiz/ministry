Although the messages did not form a series, every one of them was an exposition of scriptural passages and not a free talk.</P><P>This magazine was comparatively simple in nature. It was published for young believers-those who are young spiritually. It sometimes contained news with reports on the work of the brothers in Shanghai and elsewhere.</P><P>The magazine was published twice a month, beginning in April 1930 and ending in June 1934. There were a total of fifty issues. We have published them in three volumes. Issue Nos. 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 are missing. Issue No. 27, entitled "Who Can Draw Near to God," was given by Brother Meek and is not included in this work. Four additional messages, "Forgiveness and Confession," "The Power of Resurrection," "A Noble Deed," and "The Pathway to Glory-Through Jerusalem" are, according to reliable sources, articles that were published in this magazine and are included in this series. The fourth message in the series on "The Rapture and the Tribulation," was printed in The Christian (Resumed) and not part of these fifty issues of Notes on Scriptural Messages. Nevertheless, it is a continuation of the last few messages of this magazine and, as such, is included in this series.</P><P>Some of these articles appeared later in the series Twelve Baskets Full in twelve volumes.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
