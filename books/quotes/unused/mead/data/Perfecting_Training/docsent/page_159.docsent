   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>YOUR REAL SITUATION AND CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you will get into these negative items and even pray-read these negative items, you will see who you were and perhaps still are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You will see in what condition and situation you were and still are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You will realize and you will see your real being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of these eleven negative letters, two tell us who we were and perhaps who we still are: dead persons and debtors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the rest of the nine negative letters tell us something of our condition and our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as you are even a little bit involved with these nine items of your natural situation, you are not under the leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The leading by the Spirit is altogether outside the sphere of these eleven negative items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this you can see how mistaken Christians have been in their talk about the leading of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have thought that they have the leading of God, yet they are still under sin, under the sinful law, even under a kind of spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They don t have peace with God; rather they have a kind of enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their mind is not on the spirit but rather on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have a lot of practices of the mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet they think that they are under the leading of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regardless of how much you think or feel that you are under the leading of God, you are actually outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are actually far beyond the leading of God, because the leading of the Spirit is altogether something far beyond these eleven items.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You say that you have the leading of God, but are you a living person or a dead person?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You say that you have the Lord s leading to do this or to do that, but when you do that are you a debtor, or are you a released person?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Forty to fifty years ago I had many experiences of this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time I could even tell people boldly that I had the leading of the Lord, yet truthfully I felt I was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand I thought I was under the leading of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But on the other hand I had the sensation that I was dead, that I was a debtor, that I was not free.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I did not have the peace with God; there was a kind of enmity within me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to remember all of these eleven items of negative letters in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will help us to realize whether or not the leading we have is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the leading is by the Spirit, it surely does not have any of these eleven items.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Too many times what we thought was the leading by the Spirit actually was not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, it was composed with some other letters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LETTERS ON THE POSITIVE SIDE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the positive side there are eleven letters to spell out the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are such positive components.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is the law of life, there is the Spirit of life, and there is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is also the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means our human spirit mingled with the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then there are the things of such a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the mind set on such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then follows the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then comes God, the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that the Spirit and God, God and the Spirit, are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of God means God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way the Spirit of Christ means that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is the One, the resurrecting One, who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So the Triune God is here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit of life is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit of God is God the Father as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And the Spirit of Christ is God the Son as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All three are here as the One who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THREE ASPECTS CONCERNING THE RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you noticed that the New Testament tells us three aspects concerning Christ s resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Firstly, the New Testament tells us that God, that is, God the Father, raised Him up Acts 2:24, 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this case Christ was not active; He was passive because He was raised up by God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But other verses in the New Testament tell us that Christ Himself rose up 1 Thes 4:14; 1 Cor 15:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not the passive voice but the active voice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thirdly, the New Testament also tells us that God raised Jesus by the power of the Spirit Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These three aspects show us that in the resurrection of Christ, the Three of the Godhead are all involved.</S>
