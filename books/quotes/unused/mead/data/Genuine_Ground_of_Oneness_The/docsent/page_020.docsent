   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BABYLON THE GREAT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 17 also indicates that evil is related to division.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter presents a vision of Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to verse 5, Babylon the Great is called "The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 4 exposes the fact that although this woman has a pleasant appearance, evil is concealed within her: "And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly Babylon the Great is clothed in purple and scarlet and is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, she has a golden cup in her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this cup is full of abominations and unclean things of her fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a picture of Christendom today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christendom may have the golden cup, but the contents of the cup are idolatry, fornication, and every kind of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the element, the composition, of division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ultimate issue of division is the Babylon the Great unveiled in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today's Christianity is altogether in a state of division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This division has opened the way for idolatry and spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In many cases, it has even opened the way for literal idolatry and physical fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we have pointed out again and again, this is the issue of division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SERIOUSNESS OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we turned to the way of the Lord's recovery and came into the church life, the negative things associated with division were spontaneously set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, as we have pointed out, those who forsake the proper oneness automatically become subject to the very evil things that once were put away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This should cause us to see that division is an extremely serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing is more dreadful than division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan knows that even the thought of division is sufficient to undermine our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is like a termite that eats away at the very structure of a house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, even the thought of division must be repudiated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are in the oneness, we are in life, and we enjoy every positive virtue and attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, our spiritual condition gradually improves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, simply by accepting a divisive thought, the way is opened for evil to enter in once again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should never think that the church ground is not a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ground of the church is the very base of our experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To remain in oneness is to remain in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apart from the ground of the church, it is vain to talk about holiness or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such things are directly related to oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is marvelous to stay in the oneness, but it is terrible to be involved in division.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of today's Christians have lost the Lord's blessing and grace simply because of division.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This must be a warning to us in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us not repeat the history of the divisiveness of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May we all look to the Lord that He may preserve us in His oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to loathe even the thought of divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord for the oneness!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord keep us in His presence by keeping us in this oneness.</S>
