   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOING OUR BEST TO SOW K'UN-MING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been in K'un-ming for almost half a year learning to serve God with Brother Dao-sheng under the leading of Brother Ruo-tien.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Ruo-tien is mostly responsible for edification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Dao-sheng and I are responsible for preaching the gospel on the Lord's Day afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are very busy in the gospel work in K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters are very burning for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to the large weekly gospel meeting on the Lord's Day, there are two or three home gospel meetings or outdoor gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are doing our best to sow the seeds of the gospel, leaving it to the Lord to do the work of bringing in the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We went to Mongtze County recently and stayed there for two months.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We preached the gospel for twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some were saved, and they have begun meeting and having the table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We feel really ashamed that we have not met the people's needs enough!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May God have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We hope you could instruct us more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your brother,</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FEELING ALONE PINGYUAN, HONAN PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I returned from Shanghai, I went home quickly because my father was ill.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After several days my father recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then it snowed, and I was trapped in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of the Chinese New Year, I touched something of the world which bothered my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I left home on the second day of the Chinese New Year and went more than two hundred li to Handao to visit the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At Chingfeng I saw that the brothers were blessed through tribulations, and I rejoiced very much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I personally felt, however, that I was set aside by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While I was at the North China Seminary in Teng Shian in 1940, I read The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since then I returned to this region to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past two years, I have felt a deep need I am lonesome and without a partner.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have read the messages in The Ministers concerning the coordination between the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is my need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the work is regional, there must be a local church like Antioch as the center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I feel that it is very difficult for me to be alone here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The churches in this region all need edification for new beginners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The distance between churches is over one hundred li.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can I do the work?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How should I choose the way ahead of me?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am praying to see how the Lord would lead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope the leading brothers could give me some direction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, I am really not worthy to preach the word!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your little brother,</S>
