<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Sixteen</H2><P>Verse 16: "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth."</P><P>The Lord demanded His messengers to repent and to drive the sinning ones from their midst. The Lord considers the messengers the ones responsible before Him. When men follow the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans, the Lord holds the messengers responsible. The Lord rebuked the messengers because He considers them the representatives of the church. The Lord considers it their responsibility to excommunicate from the church those who follow the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans. To excommunicate those who believe in heresy does not mean to drive away the unbelievers from the midst of the believers. It means to drive out those Christians who have erred in conduct and in doctrine. The Lord has to preserve the purity of the church. If the church will not execute punishment, the whole body of the church will be damaged by errors. The Lord wants His children to be firm and pure in conduct and in doctrine. If this cannot be maintained, the sinning ones should be excommunicated for the sake of protecting the other children of God. A heresy or a sinful act must be punished, even if it is committed by a saved Christian. Otherwise, this heresy or evil will become the leaven that ferments the whole lump. For the sake of the purity of the church, and in order to prevent other believers from being deceived, it is indispensable for the church to punish the sinning Christians. Moreover, this punishment is beneficial also to the excommunicated believers, for when the church exercises righteousness and love to remove the sinning ones from the church according to the teaching of the Bible and the leading of the Holy Spirit, the sinning ones will be recovered to their true faith and will repent of their sinful acts through the punishment. If this is not done, the condition will worsen and there will be no chance for turning back. Hence, excommunication either leads one to turn back or preserves the purity of the whole. In either case, it is beneficial. It is beneficial not only from man's point of view, but it is a necessary removal from God's point of view. Apart from doing this, there is no way to maintain the Lord's honor and holiness. The Lord is in the midst of the churches. His person and attributes must be honored. If any man in the church follows sin or heresy, he is despising and damaging the person and attributes of the Lord. The church in Pergamos did not execute judgment according to the Lord's intention. As a result the Lord called them to repentance. Often believers do not remove sinful ones from among their midst because of natural affections, fear of troubles, considerations, indifference, and apathy. The Lord's way is to wait patiently and to stir up the conscience of the believers by suitable means so that they will become zealous for the Lord Himself and for His house. If they continue to remain cold, He will then come to judge the sins that the church cannot judge. If believers would remember that the house of God should be pure and that God Himself is a consuming fire, they will know how to preserve the order in the house of God and will not come into conflict with God's holiness.</P><P>What are the limits of the excommunication of believers? These are covered clearly in the Bible. First, there must be obvious sins. Naturally, it is unavoidable for believers to become weak or to fail, and sometimes they are liable to sin. However, these are not the basis of excommunication. A believer should be excommunicated only on the ground of obvious immorality. We can see this clearly from 1 Corinthians 5.</P><P>Second, there must be heresies involved. We know that even the best believers may have differences in biblical exposition and doctrinal views. What then are the heresies? The Bible allows believers to have freedom of opinions. In many things man has the freedom to be led directly by the Lord. Many particular views should be tolerated with forbearance and love by Christians. We can see this clearly from Romans 14 and 15. However, those who do not believe in the Lord Jesus coming in the flesh and other fundamental doctrines concerning the person of the Lord Jesus should be excommunicated. First John 4 and 2 John 6-7 along with other places have covered the matter clearly. Hence, in order for the church to excommunicate a person, he must have obvious immoral sins or must be one who denies the fundamental doctrines.</P><P>The Lord did not consider the whole church as having failed. He only considered this sin to be local and not global. The whole church must surely bear the responsibility. However, judgment will only come to the sinning ones. "I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth." It is not to war with you. Although sin can grow and can corrupt the whole church, the Lord considers His faithful people as a remnant. When the Lord comes, His people will either rejoice or be sorrowful. The reason for this is that there are differences among them in faith and work. The Lord Jesus has the authority to judge all those who have sinned.</P><P>"I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth." The Lord's sword is not in vain. Here He is telling us that He Himself is judging His own servants with the power of God's judging word. We have mentioned that the spiritual significance of the sword is the word of God. If believers despise God's word of teaching, warning, and correction, the same word will in that day judge and punish the believers through the power of Christ.</P>
