   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we extol You again, acknowledging that You are the One whom God sent to speak His words and that You are also the One who gives the Spirit, the bountiful Spirit, all-inclusive Spirit, life-giving Spirit, the indwelling Spirit, not by measure.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Oh, this really meets our need!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need the word and we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need the words of life and we need the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we thank You that through the years You have been speaking Your word to Your recovery and that You have been also giving Your Spirit to Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank You for Your revelation and for Your move.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We praise You that You have shown us Your economy, with Christ as the centrality and the universality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Oh, what a Christ we have!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We thank You for Your organic salvation, we thank You for Your Christ, and we thank You for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, we are still here receiving Your revelation with Your vision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every day You give us new words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank You for showing us that we participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have received Your life and Your nature, and by these we participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We thank You that we also have the divine mind, the mind of Christ, and by this also we participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We thank You that we are enjoying the riches of Christ as the element that transforms us metabolically so that by this metabolism we can participate in God s divinity to the fullest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, we are here before You to enjoy something further.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, as we come to the matters of conformation and glorification, we ask You to be with us and to give us the words, the new language for a new culture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once again, we pray that You will cover us from Your enemy, the troublemaker.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Bind him and put him into the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I. THE SECRET OF CONFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Conformation is the seventh section of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. God s Intention</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s intention is to make man like Him in His divine life, in His divine nature, and in His image as His expression, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For God to make man like Him in this way actually means to make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has imparted Himself into us to make us the same as He is in life and in nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the divine intention.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. God Regenerating the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to carry out His intention, God regenerates the believers in Christ with His divine life that they may begin to participate in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we, the believers in Christ, participate in God s divinity, we are gods.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Peter 1:4 says that we partake of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To partake of something is to participate in that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We partake of God s nature and thus we participate in God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine One has imparted Himself into us to become our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He dispenses Himself into us to be our life, our nature, our mind, and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are not those who participate in God s divinity, then who participates in it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The angels cannot participate in God s divinity, because they do not possess anything of God as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are more blessed than the angels, for they are merely God s servants, but we are God s sons, possessing God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. The Believers Beginning to Grow</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After they have been regenerated, the regenerated believers begin to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Feeding</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as a child grows through feeding, the regenerated believers grow through the divine feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, many of today s Christians are not growing, because with them there is no feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Due to their lack of feeding, they also lack the proper sanctification, renewing, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We grow first through the divine feeding and then through the divine sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sanctification causes us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we are sanctified, the more we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In John 17:17-19 the Lord Jesus prayed, saying, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And for their sake I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be sanctified is to be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Daily we need to be sanctified, separated from the world, so that through this sanctification we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Renewing</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The regenerated believers grow also through the divine renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Renewing is therefore a factor of growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The divine transformation in the divine life is a strong factor of the believers growth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without the divine transformation we cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many of today s Christians do not grow because they do not have the divine feeding, the divine sanctification, the divine renewing, and the divine transformation.</S>
