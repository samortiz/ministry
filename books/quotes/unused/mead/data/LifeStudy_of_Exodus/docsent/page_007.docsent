   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As slaves in Egypt, the children of Israel built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses v. 11 . Pithom means mouth of integrity, and Raamses means thunder of the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These names indicate that Pharaoh s treasure cities were built for pride and boastful display, just as the pyramids were.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that, under Pharaoh, the Egyptians had these treasure cities built in order to boast of their integrity, honesty, and goodness and also to propagate their cultural standard.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In contrast to the worldly people, the Lord Jesus did not boast of His integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of boasts, words of grace issued from His mouth Luke 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, with the Lord there was no thundering of the standard.</S>
