   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Revelation 1:4; 4:5; and 5:6 the Spirit is referred to as the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, for the overcomers in the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, the churches were degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit needed to be intensified to deal with the degraded situation among God's people on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Revelation 1:4-5 the seven Spirits are ranked among the three of the Triune God, showing that the seven Spirits are the Spirit of God in the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these verses the Spirit is mentioned second, not third, indicating that in the carrying out of God's recovery work in a degraded situation, the Spirit is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today everything of the Triune God has been processed and consummated in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, what we need is this all-inclusive Spirit intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament, this intensified Spirit is typified by the seven lamps of the lampstand Zech 4:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The seven lamps before the throne in Revelation 4:5 are for the shining, the enlightening, and the burning in carrying out God's building work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Exodus 25 with the tabernacle and in Zechariah 4 with the rebuilding of the recovered temple, God needed these seven lamps to burn, to shine, and to expose for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, these seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God Rev 4:5 , and the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the recovery today we need the seven Spirits to come in to search us, to enlighten us, and to shine into us in order to expose our worldliness, our fleshliness, our deadness, and our lukewarmness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to become vital for the practice of the vital groups, we need to exercise to have a thorough confession before the Lord, until vitality is brought in. For such a confession we need the searching and shining of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need the shining and burning of these seven Spirits so that the building work can go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the Spirit is the consummated Spirit to be the reality and the realization of the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God to be one with the bride of the Lamb Christ to proclaim the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 22:17 says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And let him who hears say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this verse the title the Spirit indicates that everything of the Triune God has been processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now as the Spirit He brings the Triune God into us to be one with us as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This consummated Spirit has joined Himself to the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, at the end of Revelation the Spirit and the bride speak together, saying, "Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the Lord's coming He needs people who have been searched and burned by the sevenfold Spirit until in their being and their living, the Spirit and the bride are speaking together, saying, "Come, Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>7 brothers</S>
