<h1 class="title">LEADING PEOPLE TO LIVE<br />
THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>After their salvation people often ask how to live the Christian life. This question is related to our work. As those who serve full time, our work is to lead people to salvation, and after a person is saved, we need to lead him to live the Christian life. I would ask this question: according to our knowledge and experience, how should a person live the Christian life?</p>
<p>Some say that to live the Christian life is to live in spirit, to live a life according to the spirit, and to know that Christ is our life. This answer is too general; it is not specific. If we use only these items to lead the newly saved ones to live the Christian life, they will feel empty. Others say that the Christian life is a life that depends on the Lord. Although this answer is not wrong, it is vague. A new believer will not be able to touch the substance of what depending on the Lord means. Hence, we should not use theories or high and profound spiritual doctrines when we speak with new believers. Since we are speaking about practice, we must be specific.</p>
<p>Some have proposed that we use the sequence recorded in 2 Corinthians 3 through 7 to speak to new believers concerning how to live the Christian life. This way, however, is too particular. We cannot use it to lead new believers in living the Christian life. We need a practical and normal way. Of course, it would be more practical to use only some verses in 2 Corinthians instead of using an entire section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying, Reading the Bible, Meeting,<br />
and Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>When we lead new believers, we must be practical and help them build up a living of praying, reading the Bible, meeting, and preaching the gospel. Among these items, prayer must be the first. This can be likened to newborn babies, who first learn to breathe and then learn to drink milk. A Christian&rsquo;s breathing is praying. Hence, when helping the new believers, we should not help them first to read the Bible but to pray. We may say to the new believers, &ldquo;Now that you are saved, you must live the Christian life. The first item in the Christian life is prayer.&rdquo; In practice, we may speak from our own experience concerning prayer, but we should not speak too long. Later, we can tell them that the second important thing in the Christian life is reading the Bible. We can tell them how to read the Bible or suggest which book to read. If the new believers have questions, we should endeavor to answer them. When time allows, we can explain the structure of the Bible, telling them about the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p>
<p>The third important thing is to meet with other believers. We must tell new believers that the church is a corporate body and that the church is also our home. A newborn baby needs a home; it is a pitiful thing for a baby to be homeless. The church is now our home, and it can take care of us in many aspects. The fourth matter in the Christian life is to preach the gospel. In leading new believers to live the Christian life, we must help them in these four matters: praying, reading the Bible, meeting, and preaching the gospel. We would have good results if, after their baptism, the new believers could spend three or five days together, eating their meals together, having morning revival together, and being taught how to pray, read the Bible, meet, and preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Leading new believers to practice these items depends entirely on how much we know and experience these items. If we neither pray much nor know much about prayer, we will not be able to render help to others. This also applies to reading the Bible. If we do not spend time reading the Bible or know the Bible well, having little light or experience, we will be able to give others only knowledge and doctrine, not real help. Today the education level in Taiwan is rather high, such that even a newly saved brother in junior high school will have many questions concerning the Bible. He may ask why he should read the Bible, what the Bible is, and what is its source and content. We should explain that the Bible is God-breathed, that we can know and gain the Lord by reading the Bible, and that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. However, we must remember to be very careful when answering questions. When we say that the Bible is God-breathed, he may want to know what we mean by God-breathed. Perhaps we would say that the Bible is the word of God, but he may ask why the Bible is the word of God and what <em>the word of God</em> means. Hence, we must be careful and thoughtful when we answer the questions of a new believer in order to not introduce more questions. This requires learning. Since we are serving full time, we must be prepared by using the publications and reading the Bible as often as we can. We must cultivate and build up these matters first in ourselves.</p>
