 <h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A LOVING HEART<br />
AND A RECEIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that we were made as vessels so that the Lord could be our life and content. It is rather easy to take a cup and to fill it with water. It is not so easy, though, for God to fill us with Himself. In order to be filled, we need a heart that loves the Lord and a spirit to receive the Lord. Thus, when we were regenerated, the Lord renewed our heart and our spirit. Ezekiel 36:26-27 says that the Lord gave us a new heart and a new spirit and that He put His own Spirit into us.</p>
<p>As physical beings, we need food. However, in order to receive the food, we need a heart to desire the food and a mouth and stomach to receive the food. Without a heart to desire the food and a mouth and stomach to receive the food, we could never take in the food. Sometimes we cannot eat because we do not have the appetite, and other times we cannot eat because there is a problem with our mouth or an ulcer in our stomach. Thus, even though the food may be quite delicious, and though we may truly need it, we may be unable to eat it. This is often the situation in our relationship with God. Many times we simply do not have a heart for Him. Even though we may pray to Him with our mouth, our heart may be far away from Him (Matt. 15:8). Furthermore, we may not know how to exercise our spirit to receive Him. How can we receive the Lord if our heart is far from Him and we do not know how to use our spirit?</p>
<p>The real Christian life is not a matter of teaching; it is a matter of Christ Himself as a living person. It is not good enough to come to the Lord merely to learn something. We must come to contact the Lord as a living person and take Him as our food. When we come to a meal, there is no need to learn anything. What we need is an appetite and to know how to exercise our mouth and our stomach to take in the food. Whenever we come to a meeting, to the Word, or to the Lord directly, we must exercise our heart to love Him and exercise our spirit to contact, take in, and receive Him. However, many times when we come to the meetings or read the Word, we do not have a heart that is turned toward the Lord, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. We are like people who are sitting at a dining table spread with delicious food but are only looking at and examining the food, not knowing how to exercise our mouths and stomachs to eat the food. We must ask ourselves whether or not we have a real, sincere heart that loves the Lord and whether or not we know the best way to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. We may have a brilliant mind, but do we have a loving heart and a seeking spirit? Do we have a sincere heart and a right spirit toward the Lord? Our primary responsibility is not to learn about the Lord but to take and receive the Lord. We must take the Lord in first by our heart and then by our spirit. We must exercise our heart to love the Lord and exercise our spirit to take in, contact, and receive the Lord. This is not a doctrine; this is a spiritual reality.</p>
<p>The Lord is so real and living to us because He is the Spirit and is in our spirit. If we know how to exercise our spirit, we will be able to contact the Lord and be in the current of the transmitting Spirit. The Holy Spirit as the transmitting current will transmit the essence of the Lord into us. However, we must allow our concepts and thoughts to be adjusted and corrected. It is not by thinking in our mind that we contact the Lord; rather, it is by loving the Lord with our heart and receiving Him with our spirit. We must pray again and again that the Lord would enable us to love Him. Day and night, morning and evening, we must pray that the Lord would strengthen us to love Him in a full way. The more we love the Lord, the more our heart will be purified and renewed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE HEART</h2>
<p>In order to have a heart that loves the Lord, we must deal with our heart, which has four parts&mdash;the conscience, the mind, the will, and the emotion (Heb. 10:22; Matt. 9:4; Heb. 4:12; John 16:6, 22). The conscience must be purified and cleansed by the precious blood of Jesus. We must have a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16). If there is any condemnation or offense in our conscience, this will spoil our heart, and our heart will not be at peace. Thus, we must confess all our sins to the Lord and have our conscience sprinkled from every evil thing. Then we will have a conscience void of offense and will be at peace in our heart.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our mind must be simplified. When we are with the Lord, we should not consider or think too much. Instead, we should be simple in our mind. We must be careful that our thoughts would not be corrupted by the enemy from the simplicity toward Christ (2 Cor. 11:3). The brothers must especially be careful not to exercise their mind too much. If you have a brilliant mind and exercise it too much, your mind may be corrupted from the simplicity toward the Lord by too much considering. Much of the time we are troubled by this kind of corruption. Therefore, we must ask the Lord to simplify our mind. We must have a mind like a child&rsquo;s (Matt. 18:3; Mark 10:15). Also, our will must be meek and soft, and our emotion must be full of love. Then our heart will be a right heart, a pure heart, and a heart that loves the Lord. This was the kind of heart that Mary had as she poured the precious ointment upon the Lord (Matt. 26:7). Her heart was a heart with a clean conscience, a simple mind, a meek will, and an emotion full of love. How she loved the Lord! We must ask the Lord to give us such a heart and to renew our heart to such a condition.</p>
