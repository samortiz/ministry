   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Release of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Release of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the release of the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The release of the spirit means the release of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has entrusted the Holy Spirit to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His intention is for the church to be the innermost being out of which will flow rivers of living water of the Spirit John 7:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church is the vessel of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize what is the work of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is the vessel of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has not poured out His anointing oil indiscriminately on the whole world; He has poured it out on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church now anoints men with this anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meaning of the church being a vessel of the Holy Spirit is not that it is an instrument used by the Holy Spirit but that it is a vessel to contain the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is a vessel, which means that the Holy Spirit is contained in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But how is God s Spirit contained in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The part in us that contains God s Spirit is simply our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All Bible students acknowledge this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The type in the Old Testament is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The dove sent out by Noah could not descend on the old creation; it could only descend on the new creation Gen 8:6-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our entire being, only the spirit is of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the Holy Spirit can only remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exodus says that the holy anointing oil could not be poured on the flesh 30:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No part of the flesh can contain the Holy Spirit; the spirit is the only place that can contain the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ezekiel 36 says this in a more explicit way: A new spirit will I put within you....And I will put my Spirit within you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The new spirit is our spirit, while my Spirit is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not have a new spirit within us, we cannot possibly have God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must have a new spirit before we can have His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meaning of pushing out our spirit is to release the Holy Spirit together with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All Bible students know that in many instances in the Greek language it is hard to differentiate between the human spirit and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word spirit is spoken of most frequently in chapter eight of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet in Romans 8 it is hard to tell which occurrence of the word spirit refers to the human spirit and which refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In English there is a distinction of capitalization, but in Greek, there is no distinction of capitalization.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man s spirit is already united to God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more training we receive, the more released our spirit becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Holy Spirit is released when our spirit is released because the Holy Spirit dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the release of the spirit does not refer just to the release of our spirit, but to the release of the Holy Spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The extent of the release of the Holy Spirit depends entirely on the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit is limited by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we speak to a brother or to an unbelieving sinner, our spirit determines the degree of the release of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The matter hinges on the vessel; there is no problem with the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers, we should not be so foolish as to put all the responsibility on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today the Lord has placed the responsibility on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew 18:18 shows us the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 20:23 says nearly the same thing as Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both speak of the Lord forgiving the sins of those whom we forgive and retaining the sins of those whose sins we retain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is because we have received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord did not say, I have given you the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you recognize the Spirit s forgiveness of someone, you should forgive him yourself as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you recognize the Spirit s retaining of someone s sins, you should retain his sins as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord only told the church to acknowledge the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After it has acknowledged the Holy Spirit, it can then forgive someone, and the Lord will forgive that one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It can retain someone s sins, and the Lord will retain his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today the authority of the Holy Spirit is at the disposal of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How great is the responsibility of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God acted alone, it would not matter much whether or not the church failed a little.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God has entrusted everything to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If authority rested solely with the Holy Spirit, the success or failure of a minister would not be of much consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the Holy Spirit has bound Himself to the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the minister fails, the Holy Spirit has no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If God kept all authority in His hand, it would not matter much whether or not we stumbled or failed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But today God has not kept the work of the Holy Spirit in His hand; He has put this work in the hand of the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the spirit of a minister is released, God s Spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If his spirit is not released, God s Spirit is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God is willing and happy to entrust His authority to the ministers, giving them a free hand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only the most foolish person will think that he can act hastily; only the foolish ones are nonchalant.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must remember that the problem today is with the ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether or not the Holy Spirit can be released is in the hand of the ministers.</S>
