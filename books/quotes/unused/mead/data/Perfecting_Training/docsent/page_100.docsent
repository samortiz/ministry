   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR THE MAIN FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we have a high mountain to climb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In expression or in terminology, it may not sound that high.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in actuality, in biblical doctrine, very few points are so high, so deep, so difficult to explain, so difficult to get.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The high mountain is this: What is the main function of the law of the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the main work, the major work, that the law of the Spirit of life does within us?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The terminology is very simple, but it is very hard to tell and to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us read Romans 8:2: For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you come to this verse without so much knowledge, you can see the major function easily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The major function of the law of the Spirit of life is to free us from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Its major function is to free us from another law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AS THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to remember that while Romans 8 is on the law of the Spirit of life, its major work is to free us from another law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That law is the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we could be freed from that law, we would have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We would be regulated, we would be conformed, we would be spiritual, we would be victorious, we would be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main thing is that we need to be freed from another law, the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we have two laws.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the Triune God processed to be the indwelling Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This title means a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Don t think this is merely my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is exactly what Paul is teaching in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul doesn t say that just God dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He didn t write in such a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why very few Christians can understand Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul uses many terms: God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Jesus, the One who raised up Christ Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, you have God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul used so many complicating or implicating expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why was Paul so troublesome, so complicating, in his writing?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had a strong purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, Paul said that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Three things are here: likeness, flesh, and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was Paul s way of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consummately speaking, He is the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the indwelling Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God as mentioned in Genesis 1 where the Spirit of God was brooding over the darkness upon the water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 8 is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to realize that all of the complicating, implicating expressions indicate that God is triune and that this Triune God has been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This Triune God after being processed is now ultimately the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This very God is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the law of the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The law of the Spirit of life is such a Triune, processed, indwelling God as the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Within us, He is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I don t believe many Christians have ever considered God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Mostly we were taught that God is powerful, merciful, faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever God says, He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He will help us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we all can testify that He didn t help us so much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We wanted to get rid of our temper, but God didn t help us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seems the more I pray asking God to kill my temper, the more temper I have.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a husband, the more you endeavor to love your wife, praying that the Lord would help you to love her, the more you may be disgusted with her.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE ENTIRE TRIUNE GOD IS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In school you have been educated, and in the church you have been edified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many wives like to see their husbands coming to the so-called church to be edified, hoping that their husbands would love them more.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Likewise, the husbands like to see their wives going to the so-called church so that they will be edified and not trouble them so much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the situation among so many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But who knows the law of the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Very few!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hardly any Christians know that this law is the very God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the Creator, the One who was incarnated, the Redeemer, the Savior, the processed One, and consummately He is the Spirit indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some would even oppose our saying that the Triune God is such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They have forgotten that even the Lord Himself said that God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Does this mean that only the Creator God is Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That the Father is not the Spirit and the Son is not the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Does this indicate that only the Spirit is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the traditional teaching of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Is God in John 4:24 only God the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Is He not God the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Is He not God the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, the Triune God is there the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the Spirit is the Spirit, is not the Son the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Is not the Father the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord Jesus said that God, meaning the Triune God, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Most Christians today only know the so-called traditional, theological terminology concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They say God the Father is one, God the Son is one, and God the Spirit is one.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They say these are three separate and distinct Persons, that you cannot say that the Father is the Spirit, and the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You can only say the Spirit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have to ask them about John 4:24 which says God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christians today have never been told and never been taught properly what is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
