   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TURNING ON THE SWITCH TO TOUCH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, within this life-giving Spirit, there is God, man, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is Jesus, Christ, the Triune God, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the One all men need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is also the One we love to preach about.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is life, and He is also the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the true I AM.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever we need, He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is love, patience, power, authority, and everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His name is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His person is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we call "O Lord Jesus!'' what comes to us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is the Triune God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the Lord, the life, and the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through calling on His name, we receive the Spirit who, as the Spirit of life that gives life, becomes everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is easy to say, but the fact is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can illustrate this with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know that electricity is in the power station, but through the installation of the electric wires, electricity is joined to our house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the house there are many electrical appliances, such as the electric fan, the air conditioner, the electric lamp, and the sound system.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we need to use these appliances, all we need to do is to turn on the switch, and the electricity will come; the fan will turn, the air conditioner will work, the lamps will light up, and the sound will come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What I am speaking about here is like the all-purpose electricity; there is light, air, and sound.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It supplies whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Chinese characters, the words electricity and Spirit are made of the same root character, which means rain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The two are of the same kind; both come from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible says that the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It also says that when the Son of Man comes, He will be like the lightning Matt 24:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, we all know that in order to have electricity, we need to turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, in order to apply the all-inclusive Spirit of the Lord, we need to learn to turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, all the millions of truly regenerated Christians have the heavenly electricity installed into them, but they do not all know where the switch is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not even know that there is such a switch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the reason, when I came to America twenty-seven years ago, I told people right from the start that the Lord Jesus today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within us is a spirit, and the Lord as the Spirit desires to enter into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spirit within man is made to receive God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is like a radio receiver with a receiving device within it made especially to receive the radio waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In God's creation, there is a part in man that is very peculiar, which is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the organ to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I first came to America, everywhere I went, I spoke to people about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many had never heard such words before.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They knew of only two kinds of spirits, the Holy Spirit of God and the evil spirit of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They did not know that there is a spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I often quoted three verses from the Scriptures and read to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every one of these three portions speaks of two spirits, the Spirit of God and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first portion is John 3:6, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second is John 4:24, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The third portion is Romans 8:16, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.''</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are saved, our spirit is regenerated, and God's Spirit enters into our spirit, strengthening our spirit and bringing God's life into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have preached the gospel to some Chinese Confucianists before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They always think that Christianity is a foreign religion: that the Bible is merely a book translated in very good contemporary literary style; that what it talks about is nothing but "Wo-men, Ne-men, Ta-men, and Amen,'' that is, "We, you, they, and Amen,'' and that there is nothing deep or profound about it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was young, I was taught briefly under the old Chinese school system, and I learned some classical Chinese works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I knew that the highest teaching of the Confucianists tells men that "the Way of the Great Learning lies in the development of the bright virtue.''</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The development of the bright virtue is equivalent to the function of the conscience expounded by Wang Yang-ming, a Chinese philosopher.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is also the same as the conscience that we speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Way of the Great Learning in Confucianism is the enlightening and development of this bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible, however, clearly tells us that man is composed of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Within the body there is the soul, and within the soul there is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we believe in the Lord and call on Him, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The two spirits are added together, joined, and mingled as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through this, He brings to us God and the life of God as well, and He enlivens our deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now, within the spirit of the saved believers, there is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is also God and the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is much greater than the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The bright virtue, which is the conscience, is only a part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In addition to this part, the spirit also has two other parts: fellowship and intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For my whole life, I have been reading mainly this one book, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not say that this is a foreign religion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although it did come from the West, it is not a product of the West.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Its origin is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is God in heaven who prompted over forty writers to complete this book within a period of fifteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The revelations contained in it are too deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This revelation is what I am speaking this time, that is, the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This Spirit is simply God Himself entering into us to be our life and all our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you want to live Christ and serve in coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All you need to do is to touch this Spirit and to allow this Spirit to operate within you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The way we touch this Spirit is by turning on the switch, which is to call "O Lord Jesus!''</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The wonder in the kernel of the Bible is that the Triune God as Jehovah has passed through all the processes including death and resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the One we preach and testify today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is also the One we believe in, receive, follow, and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is in heaven, and He is also with us and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is our life, to be our way in everything.</S>
