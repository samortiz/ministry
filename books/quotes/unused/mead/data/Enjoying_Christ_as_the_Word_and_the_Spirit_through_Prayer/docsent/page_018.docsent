   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>READING AND PRAYING TO BE FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE WORD AND WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ten minutes before dinner is served, we can come to the word to read and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the time dinner comes, we already will have had a good meal, eating the word and feeding on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Try this; you will see the difference in your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your Christian life will be different from what you had in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You will know how to feed on the Lord and feed on the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, you will be filled with the word and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It will be hard to differentiate between the word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Colossians 3:16 the word of Christ fills us, but in Ephesians 5:18 we are filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two the word and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we are filled with the word, we are filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is wrong to be filled with the word but not with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not forget this formula: The word without the Spirit is knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Knowledge without life is death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When death becomes old, it has a stench.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Always reading without eating, without praying, merely amasses knowledge in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The letter kills 2 Cor 3:6 , and death brings its stench.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we have to transfer the word into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we have the Spirit, we have life, and when we have life, we have a sweet fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sweet odor of Christ will constantly spread within us 2 Cor 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The secret, the key, is to transfer the word to the Spirit by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that we should not read and study the word to gain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to do this, just as we need to go to the supermarket to buy groceries and store them up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, that is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may know much about the Bible, but how much have we eaten?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the problem among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not accustomed to eating, so we must now learn how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why I have a burden to stress the matter of our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If someone does not have the desire to eat, he is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only sick people do not have an appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a one must pray that the Lord would cure him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Healthy Christians, however, must practice to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if you feel you are clear about this, you still need more practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT NEEDING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING WE READ, NOT READING TOO QUICKLY,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND NOT COMPOSING FORMAL PRAYERS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 35:1 and 2 say, Strive, O Jehovah, with those who strive with me; / Battle against those who battle against me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>/ Take hold of buckler and shield, / And rise up as my help.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not very easy to apply a passage like this, except if under the Lord s sovereignty we have a case like the psalmist s. If we do not have such a case, we need not apply these two verses to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not try to force anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is something in verses like these to digest, then we can digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, we can simply go on to the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no need to get something from every verse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible is very rich; if we continue to read, we will get something eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It might be that on one morning we receive nothing from a particular passage, but a few months later when we have the need, the Spirit will bring it back to our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time we can pray in a better way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we eat physical food, we should not swallow it too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to chew it for a certain amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the same way, when we read and pray with the word, we should not read too quickly, and neither should we compose formal prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We simply should read and talk to the Lord in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I was young, I was very religious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever I prayed, I felt I had to kneel down and speak properly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was too religious and formal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later I realized that the Lord does not honor this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, He honors that we know how to contact Him and eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, we should not be light, loose, and wild, but on the other hand, we should forget about formality and religion and simply be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes we may read the word in the garden or in the car, sometimes we may sit to read and speak to the Lord, and at other times we may have to kneel down to read and speak to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We simply should contact the Lord by talking with Him in a very spontaneous way, yet in the spirit, to absorb Him by reading and praying, that is, by talking to the Lord based on what we have read and understood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>DEALING WITH ALL OUR PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we try to do this, we will see the difference in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many problems will be solved spontaneously by this kind of eating, because we will digest many spiritual vitamins that deal with the problems and swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are many problems that we cannot solve and that no one can help us to solve.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Likewise, there are many questions that no one can answer for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, simply by feasting on the Lord in this way, the inner supply and nourishment will take care of all our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The nourishment will solve the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The vitamins will meet the need and kill the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At one time I felt that I had a problem with my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>By the evening time it was hard for me to see or to read.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When I contacted an eye specialist, he told me that I needed to eat something with vitamin A. I said to him, There is something wrong with my seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why are you talking to me about eating?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He laughed and said, Just go buy some vitamins or cod liver oil pills and take them daily.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After three days you will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I learned from that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The problem was not that I could not see; the problem was that I was short of vitamin A. In the same principle, many problems in our Christian life are due to one thing we are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I do not mean that we are short of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We may have too much knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are short not of the prescription but of the vitamin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We simply need to take more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not argue with this; simply go to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then you will be thankful for this word.</S>
