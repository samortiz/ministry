   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PLANTED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to be rooted in Christ, we must first be planted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a number of places, the Bible speaks of planting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the song of Moses we read these words: Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in Exo 15:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 92:13 says, Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Jeremiah 2:21 the Lord says of His people, Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed, and in 32:41, I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 15:13 the Lord Jesus said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to John 15, the Lord Jesus regarded Himself as a vine and the Father as the husbandman, the One who planted the vine and cares for it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul says that we, the believers, are God s farm Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>. He also declares, I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth 1 Cor 3:6, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>. Now in Colossians 2:7 we see that we have been rooted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the land, the soil, and God has planted us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Scriptures, Christ is the unique tree into which we have been grafted and also the land, the soil, into which we have been planted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have been both grafted into Christ and planted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the good land with the soil is equal to the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is another indication that Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since Christ is both the tree and the good land, we can say that we have been grafted into Christ and also that we have been planted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to John 15, God the Father is the Planter, the Husbandman, whose Son, Christ, is the universal vine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Christ is also the good land with the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been grafted into Christ as the vine and planted into Him as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Colossians 2:11 speaks of circumcision, a type of cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is related to being grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out, 2:7 speaks of having been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is related to being planted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this message our concern is not with the aspect of grafting, but with the aspect of planting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As those who have been planted into Christ, we have been rooted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as the tiny root hairs absorb the riches from the soil, so we absorb the rich nourishment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are trees, and Christ is the soil into which we have been planted and in which we are rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we are absorbing His riches into us, and we grow by the nourishment we receive from these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ONE UNIT IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul says that he planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the believers are plants and that Christ is the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we need to ask in what part of our being this planting has taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certainly it is neither in the mind nor in the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The experience of being planted into Christ and rooted in Him takes place in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a plant is rooted in the soil, it becomes one with the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First the plant gets into the soil; then the nourishment in the soil comes into the plant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, the plant and the soil become one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The nourishing element in the soil corresponds to the life in the plant, and something within the plant corresponds to the element in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that there is a fellowship between the plant and the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this fellowship those factors in the plant and in the soil which correspond to each other become one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the plant and the soil become one unit in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our spirit we have the experience of being planted into Christ, for here we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord, who is the soil in which we are rooted, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be planted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Praise Him that He is the Spirit and that we have been created with a spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we had only a body and a soul but had no spirit, it would not be possible for us to be planted into the Lord as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, because the Lord is the Spirit and because we have a spirit, there is a correspondence between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we were regenerated, Christ as the life-giving Spirit became one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As John 3:6 clearly indicates, regeneration takes place in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we were regenerated, we were rooted in Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason Paul uses the perfect tense in 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were planted and rooted in Christ when we were regenerated in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to 2:6 and 7, we must be rooted in Christ before we can walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to walk in Christ, we must absorb the rich nourishment from the Spirit who dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, if we remain in the soul in our mind, emotion, or will we shall not receive nourishment or supply.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to turn to the spirit, to the very place where we have been regenerated and planted into the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The transaction that took place between the divine Spirit and our spirit at the time of regeneration remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may say that our spirit has married the divine Spirit and thus the two spirits have entered into an eternal union.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With this marriage there can be no separation, no divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although the natural mind may not like this marriage, our spirit appreciates it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever we face difficulties in our daily living, we should not remain in the natural mind, but turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we often prefer to remain in the mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we stay in the soul instead of turning to the spirit, we shall not be able to walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To walk in Him we must be rooted in Him in a practical way in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only when we remain in the spirit are we actually rooted in Christ and thus able to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have been planted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But when we turn to our spirit, we have the experience of being rooted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Having been rooted in Christ, we are able to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way we experience Christ as the good land with the rich soil that affords us the nourishing life element.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we are rooted into this soil, the more we absorb the nourishment of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not the objective Christ in doctrine; it is the subjective Christ in our experience.</S>
