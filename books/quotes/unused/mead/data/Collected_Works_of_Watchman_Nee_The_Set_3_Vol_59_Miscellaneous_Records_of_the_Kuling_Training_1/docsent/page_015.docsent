   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S WORD SEPARATING THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The breaking of our outer man is through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God does not intend to just break our outer man, but to separate it from the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, God wants to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, the outer man must not become a hindrance to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason God has to divide our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning this, we have to read Hebrews 4:12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These two verses show us that the soul and the spirit can be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The inner man and the outer man can be divided from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This division is done by the word of God, and this division is like the separation of the joints from the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's word divides the soul from the spirit, and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is living and operative, and it is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The innermost parts of man's body are the joints and marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The two-edged sword is so sharp that it is able even to divide these two things and to expose them to the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same can be said of the word with regard to its function in dividing the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The function of God's word is to divide the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we are made as naked and bare before our own eyes as we are before God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no creature that is not manifest before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the One who created them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God divides our soul from our spirit, we will see ourselves as God sees us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE REASON FOR THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEING MIXED UP WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>LIVING IN DARKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God deals with us in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the outer man has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is done mainly through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, the outer man, the soul, and the inner man, the spirit, must be separated from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is mainly done through the light of revelation from God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should study how this process is realized in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The division of the soul from the spirit is not accomplished through one particular act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God gives us light, we see what is of the spirit and what is of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to realize that darkness is the reason for them being mixed up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without darkness, there could not be a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spirit and soul are mixed up because of man's ignorance, blindness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are in darkness, we do not know what the spirit is and what the soul is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not know what the outer man is and what the inner man is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a man is in darkness, he feels that everything is good and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people think that they are Christians already, that they obey God, enjoy His blessings, receive answers to their prayers, and turn men to the Lord through their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As they consider themselves in this way, they may say that the heart is wicked, but they do not actually know how wicked the heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may say that they are corrupted, but they do not know how corrupted they are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even while they are saying these things, they are appreciating themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They think that they cannot be all that bad since they are a recipient of God's blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These ones are void of light within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not know what things are done by the spirit and what things are done by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not realize that their soul is mixed up with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>GOD'S WORD WITH HIS LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>EXPOSING MAN'S TRUE CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order for these ones to be delivered, they have to see God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day and we do not know when that day will be, but sooner or later God's word will come, and it will come with light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God's light comes with the word, it manifests the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Prior to this, a person may think that his inward motives, thoughts, and everything else are for the Lord and that he is a totally consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, when he steps into God's light and he is enlightened, he will realize the wickedness that lies within him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He will realize how much his thoughts and motives are for himself, how much his work is according to the flesh and the soul, and how much he seeks for man's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His many thoughts and hopes are set on position, fame, and gain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a man lives in darkness, he has many problems, and he does not know the thoughts and motives of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When light comes, he will realize that nothing is as he thought.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will abhor the many base thoughts in his mind, and he will realize that he is a totally self-centered person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He will feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not a miraculous act of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God merely shines His light on him and shows him his true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, the light is so strong that his true condition will be fully exposed and unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will repent and groan, and he will fall down like a lame man helplessly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This repentance and remorse will result in the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When God's word comes, His light also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It comes as a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The word does not ask anything about our work or occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When it comes, God exposes our intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His light exposes our thoughts and intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We will no longer be able to justify ourselves or go on in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Under the light we will see that our virtues are sin, our zeal is carnality, and our service to God is nothing but the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Formerly, we had one kind of evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we have a different kind of evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through this fundamental and intense revelation of our soul, the spirit and the soul are divided and the thoughts and intentions of the heart are discerned.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If our soul is not divided from our spirit, we cannot work by the spirit; we can only work by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God wants us to know how strong our soul is and how weak our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once we see this, we will identify many areas as being soulish; they belong to the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our inner man will be enlightened through this seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This revelation will separate the inner man from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our soul will be paralyzed; it will deflate like a punctured tire.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the separation of the soul from the spirit.</S>
