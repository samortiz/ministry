<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mysterious Ultimate Consummation<br>in God's Economy&#151;the New Jerusalem</H2><P>Finally, we have point number nine, which is the mysterious ultimate consummation in God's economy, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). This is the peak, the climax, of the union and mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man, resulting in the tabernacle where God dwells and lives with man, and the temple where man dwells and serves God. The two become the mutual habitation of the redeeming God and the redeemed man (Rev. 21:3, 22). On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the habitation of God. On the other hand, it is also our habitation. God dwells in it and lives with man. Man dwells in it and serves God. In such a place, the Triune God is the life supply, and the tripartite man is the outward appearance for the expression of God (Rev. 21:12, 14). The Triune God on the throne is the center of the holy city from which flows the river of life with the tree of life growing alongside to be the supply of the whole city (Rev. 22:1-2). This is the inward condition of the New Jerusalem. Outwardly, the redeemed nation of Israel, indicated by the names of the twelve tribes, is the gates of the city. The redeemed church, indicated by the names of the twelve apostles, is the walls of the city. The two are the outward appearance of the city, expressing the effulgence of God's glory (Rev. 21:11-14). Because the gates are of pearl and the walls are of jasper, they are transparent and shining, and the effulgence of God's glory is expressed this way.</P><P>Today, the church, which is joined and mingled mysteriously with the Triune God, is a miniature of this New Jerusalem. Everything should have this holy city as its highest standard and its matchless hope. If we have such a profound and transcendent realization concerning the mystery of Christ, the church, our goal and hope will be uplifted. We will see and identify with the New Jerusalem as the highest standard of everything in our lives, and our ultimate hope will also be the New Jerusalem.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 19, 1990)</P>
