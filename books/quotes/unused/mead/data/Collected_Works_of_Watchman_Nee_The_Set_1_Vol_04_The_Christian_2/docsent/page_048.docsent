   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although we may think that the suffering of Smyrna was in the nature of a chastening rod, we cannot consider her suffering to be purely of this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who suffer with Christ may not be the ones who suffer for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, sometimes God would have us suffer for Christ while we are suffering with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The saints in Smyrna suffered because of their submission to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were faithful in serving Christ, and as a result, they were put into death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their suffering was for Christ as well as with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This suffering then is not a vain suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the time comes, they will receive their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The root of the word "Smyrna" in Hebrew means "bitterness."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word was used in conjunction with myrrh, the spice for embalming the dead John 19:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is connected to death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The characteristic of this church is linked to its name and has to do with suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a church suffering for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord had lovingly restrained the roaring of the enemy so that His people would recover the freshness they had for the Lord, which otherwise would have been lost in their comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the Lord allowed His children to suffer, He stayed His harsh wind in the day of the east wind Isa 27:8 , promising them, encouraging them, praising and cherishing them, so that they would move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had no word of rebuke for their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, He kindly revealed His own power and experience as their comfort in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord revealed Himself as "the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again" Rev 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first expression reveals His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is God, and He has power in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the God that opposes Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the Holy Spirit calls the Lord Jesus by the name used by Isaiah in the ancient time when He fought for Jehovah Isa 41:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is there a name so great that our Lord is not worthy to bear it?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a comfort this name is to those who are suffering and are oppressed!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times, when hope is lost, the shaking faith would wonder where God is, thinking that it is in the world alone, fighting the cruel force of the enemy by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this is not the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever might have happened, our Lord is always "the First," promising us with the precious promises.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, He is also "the Last," being full of authority and power to execute what He has promised and will not fail even one iota or tittle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the First and the Last.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, He can lead His people on from the beginning to the end. Since He is the First as well as the Last, all the causes of His people are taken up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What more then is there to fear?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, wavering believers, what more is there to cause us to worry?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is also the One "who became dead and lived again."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet He descended to the death-place and came out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has trodden the path that His people are now treading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, He has sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who is the One that was speaking to them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the God-man who had experienced the greatest suffering on the whole earth and had Himself passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them" John 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He asks of His people only to drink the cup that He has drunk and to be baptized in the baptism that He Himself has been baptized into.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has gone through all their sufferings already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, He knows how to comfort them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted" Heb 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The end of His death-road is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For His faithful disciples, the same must be true.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus is God, but He also is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was a suffering man, and a victorious man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, He is able to comfort those in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Is there anything that He has not tasted?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we are tried, we are being brought before such a Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a gospel there is for those in suffering and trials!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How fitting it is for the church in Smyrna and the saints in Smyrna to see the Lord's nature as such here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although He was the judging One, He was still mindful of His people's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the difficult and perilous days, He was still with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is no longer rescuing His people as He did in the Old Testament, because at that time, men did not yet know that He is the victor over death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His deliverance then was to deliver them out of the furnace and the lions' den, and to save them from death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although Satan could try Job with sufferings, he could not kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life" Job 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here there was not such a restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, they should be faithful unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord did not promise to save them from the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They should instead die to glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ is able not only to deliver us from death, but to overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He wants us to realize the power of the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The death of the body does nothing but lead us to the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Who became dead and lived again."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This underlines the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord's death is not a death forever.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, it leads to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many times it is the hope of resurrection that is the strength of the martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second Corinthians 1 to 5 links the resurrection of the dead to the comforting of the suffering ones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The greatest power of the enemy is death.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the Lord transcended death and passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After the body is dead, the authority of the enemy will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Death is not for death alone, but for the initiation into a life more abundant, which is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, why should one be concerned about death?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ is the First and the Last.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is the One before death and the One after death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Moreover, He has experienced the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, the saints need not be afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Savior has passed through its stronghold.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is almighty, and He will open up the way to save His people.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After they die, they will receive their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Here the Lord Jesus is declaring His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These are the foundations of victory for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord's death and His resurrection are the only way for the Lord to overcome sin, death, and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Likewise, His saints cannot find victory in any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The victory of the church lies in her union with the Lord in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The unique ground of defeat for sin is Golgotha, the place of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Devil and all his powers meet their deathblow at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In particular, this is true with the matter of death.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the Lord's death operates in us, we will bear in our body the Lord's death 2 Cor 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The spirit of martyrdom is derived from the death of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Although the Lord has no intention that every believer be martyred, He does have the intention that we live as martyrs and that we maintain a spirit of martyrdom in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is not easy to be courageous all the way and to be unchanging in the face of death.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only by setting our mind on the Lord on the cross, on His suffering, and on His final victory in life will we be filled with the Lord's boldness and not be afraid of the death of our body, but will be a martyr in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Not only has the Lord's resurrection given us a hope and a boldness to be a martyr, but through a union with His resurrection, He has given us a life to live out the spirit of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord's death and resurrection are not two historical events only.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>These are spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we are joined to them, we will see the Lord's life prevail in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Lord is calling the church to tread the path that He has taken, because it is only proper for the Body to go through what the Head has experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Mere knowledge of the Lord's death and resurrection will not produce much effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Only those who are joined to the Lord in His death and resurrection will experience a walk that the Lord has walked.</S>
