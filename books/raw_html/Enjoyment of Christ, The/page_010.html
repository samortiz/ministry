<p>When we are fellowshipping with the Lord in our spirit, we enjoy Him in our heart. If we have no fellowship with the Lord, after receiving Him into our spirit, we will not enjoy Him. We must love the Lord with our heart and give the Lord more ground within us. Then we will enjoy Him. We cannot enjoy Him until we love Him with our heart and give Him the ground to take over all the parts of our heart. We have to realize that Christ as the Spirit is given to us as the foretaste, as the firstfruits, for our enjoyment.<p>We have to exercise our spirit to receive Him, to absorb Him, and we also have to exercise our heart to love Him. Then we will enjoy Him. Mark 12:30 tells us to love the Lord with all our heart. The heart is the loving organ. Many of the Chinese do not enjoy American food, because they do not have the heart for it. But we enjoy American food, because we have a heart for it. Many have received the Lord into their spirit, but not many have the enjoyment of Christ, because their heart is not for Him.<p>Ezekiel 36:26 speaks of a new heart and a new spirit. We need a new loving ability with a new receiving ability. We need a proper heart to love Him and to seek Him. We also need a spirit to receive Him. We must learn to contact and receive Him by exercising our spirit and to love, treasure, appreciate, and seek Him by exercising our heart. Then He will become our enjoyment in our heart.<p>In Mark 12:30 the Lord Jesus said, “You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.” The heart includes the soul and the mind. The mind is in the soul, and the soul is in the heart. Our whole strength refers to our physical strength. We love the Lord our God with all our being, that is, from our heart, through our soul, our mind, to our body. We have to love the Lord in such a specific and detailed way.<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:16 Paul said, “We have the mind of Christ.” Christ must saturate our mind from our spirit, making our mind one with His. We must give Him more and more ground to spread out of our spirit into our mind. That means our mind will be saturated with His mind, and we will have His mind. In the same principle, our emotion will be saturated with His emotion. In other words, our love will be saturated and permeated with His love. Thus, we will have His love in our love. Also, our will must be saturated with His will. Eventually, we can say that we have His heart as our heart because He has made His home in our heart. Our mind, emotion, and will must be thoroughly saturated, renewed, and transformed with Christ. Then we will have the heart of Christ as our heart.<p>In order for Christ to be our enjoyment, He must be the Spirit. John 6 says that He is the bread of life and that it is the Spirit who gives life (vv. 35, 63). Christ must be the Spirit to be the bread of life, the heavenly food, for us to enjoy. In John 7 He is the Spirit as the living water for us to enjoy (vv. 37-39). If Christ were merely the Word, He could never be our enjoyment. He must be the Spirit in order to be our enjoyment. The Spirit is given to us as the foretaste, the firstfruits, for us to enjoy in our heart.<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT BY EXERCISING OUR HEART AND OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>We have to learn how to enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit by exercising our heart and our spirit. In the Lord’s decree of the kingdom’s constitution in Matthew, He deals with these two organs. He said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens,” and, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God” (5:3, 8). Our heart must be pure, and we must be poor in spirit. To be poor in spirit is to have the capacity in the spirit for the Lord to come in. If we are rich in spirit, that means we are filled up and do not have the capacity to receive the Lord in a fresh way. We need to be emptied in our spirit to have more capacity to receive the new things of Christ. We also need to be pure, single, in our heart so that we may see God. We have to exercise our spirit that we may contact and receive the Lord and deal with our heart that we may enjoy and experience Him more and more as the Spirit.
