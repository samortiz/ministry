<h2 class="head1">A FEW POINTS REQUIRING PERSONAL ATTENTION</h2>
<p>As teachers of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we need to pay attention to this one thing: we should not dress sloppily; rather, we should dress neatly and properly. We need to dress as if we are delivering gifts to people&rsquo;s homes. Today even a salesperson dresses in a presentable way when he contacts his clients. If we do not tuck in our shirt and do not wear a tie when we bring a meeting to people&rsquo;s homes, they will think that the meeting we bring is not valuable.</p>
<p>Mormonism is a big heresy. For example, the Mormons believe that the Lord Jesus was born of Adam and Mary, and they also advocate polygamy. Yet their way of preaching is very clever. It seems that everything the Lord has led us to do in Taiwan has been &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; by them. They go out two by two, visiting people from house to house, bringing the meeting to people&rsquo;s homes, and teaching people how to begin a meeting at home. The most impressive thing is that all of their young people are in suits and are neat and tidy, giving people a very positive impression. They do not smoke or drink. Neither do they drink coffee or tea. They can gain people because they have this kind of outward appearance and a clever way of preaching.</p>
<p>Recently, in my visits to different places, I noticed that some of the brothers neither wore a tie nor a proper shirt when teaching <em>Truth Lessons.</em> This is to sell our &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; cheaply. I do not believe that anyone who sells diamonds would not wear a proper shirt and tie. Although we do not have any dress regulation or requirement, I hope that all the ones responsible for the truth classes will dress properly. In the full-time training, I once told the trainees that the colors of their shoes and their socks did not match, and the color of their ties also did not match. They needed to learn how to dress properly. In the same way, we also need to dress appropriately. If we are not properly attired, people will not be interested in us and will not believe what we say. Hence, we need to give people a feeling that we are proper and serious; moreover, we need to speak appropriately. Then people will think that we are weighty.</p>
<p>The same is true when we attend meetings. We should all dress in a serious manner. Today there is a heretical group in the Philippines that teaches people that Jesus Christ is not God, though they say He is a supreme human being. However, this group is very successful in the Philippines. The reason is that their meetings are orderly. Every attendant dresses properly, as if he were attending a banquet. The ushers wear nice uniforms, not extravagant ones but very proper ones. The area outside their compound is very messy, like all the streets in general. However, once one enters their compound, everything is orderly and regulated, and there are even attendants in the parking lot directing cars. In their meetings they exhort people to behave well, to be polite, moral, and loyal. They do not have much content in their preaching. They mainly teach people to be diligent and not slothful, to be honest and not tell lies, and to do everything by being punctual and by abiding by the rules. Many highly educated people agree with them, and many rich people like to hire members who belong to their group. Thirty years ago they had a membership of one million, and now they have four million. They surely are heretical, but because of their proper outward practice, they are very successful.</p>
<p>When I look at the situation of other groups and then consider the situation among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, my heart truly aches. Please allow me to speak a frank word, for I do have the ground. In a training I held here thirty years ago, I spoke on thirty character points. I also built a simple, plain workers&rsquo; home, but everything in it was orderly&mdash;even the plants were well trimmed and tidy. After I left for America and handed the home over to your care, it deteriorated year after year. Several times when I came back to Taiwan, I felt that the construction of hall one was good but that it had not been used properly. The entrance is not presentable. The books on the shelves are not tidy; some are worn out, and some have missing pages. Please consider this: If some educated ones who have a heart to seek the Lord, and who occupy high positions in society, came here, would they want to join us? We have erred in the Lord&rsquo;s work and misrepresented the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>I am not asking that we build magnificent meeting halls. Our meeting halls should be simple, clean, tidy, and practical. I hope that the co-workers, elders, and full-timers would have a change in concept. Today the Taiwanese society has advanced. The shop fronts and restaurants have changed their appearances. Hence, we also cannot stay the same. We should neither be as crude and simple as in the past nor should we be fashionably extravagant. We must realize that we are representing the Lord to bring &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; and &ldquo;gems&rdquo; to people. We are bringing truth, life, and the Spirit to God&rsquo;s children and God&rsquo;s chosen ones. Therefore, we should have a certain appearance, especially in our meetings.</p>
<p>Moreover, as teachers and leading ones in the meetings, we should pay attention to our speaking in public. Our natural man does not pay attention to speaking, so we need some adjustment and practice in this aspect. We should practice speaking to ourselves in front of a mirror at home and improve our speaking. Since we have received a commission to teach <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we should learn how to speak them. In particular, we should pay attention to our tone and speed. Sometimes we need to speak loudly; at other times we need to speak softly. Sometimes we need to speak fast, and at other times we need to speak slowly. Otherwise, even though we may have spoken much, people still may not understand what we have said. This is a waste. I hope that for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we all will learn this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CHANGE</h2>
<p>If the Lord wills, I will gradually hold more trainings. In the past I have held trainings in the big meetings and for the co-workers. However, I feel sorry that these trainings were failures because the co-workers did not practice accordingly. We have a vast amount of spiritual assets in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, yet our work has not been effective. This is because we have not paid attention to our appearance, and we do not have a practice that represents us well. Hence, we cannot break through in our work. The heretical group in the Philippines tripled its number in three years; however, our number has not increased; on the contrary, it has decreased. We have the truth and life, but because our method is inappropriate, we lack a proper practice to represent us. Since we have brought in the loose character of the Chinese, we are now in our current situation.</p>
<p>Please bear with me in my speaking. Today in Taiwan, people in the industrial, commercial, political, military, and academic fields are aggressively making changes. They discard old things and adopt new things. They are not the same as they were in the past. I hope that all the churches can have a big change, including the change of system that I introduced. Because of our weak foundation, our work will be quite complicated. I myself am not able to personally lead us in every detail. I hope that we all will seriously pay attention to what I have fellowshipped.</p>
<p>What I have shared is not merely related to changing our method of teaching <em>Truth Lessons.</em> I want us to see that meetings for the teaching of the truth are crucial. If the truth classes are carried out in a good way, all the other aspects of our work will be successful. The foundation of the entire church is the home meetings, and the key to successful home meetings is the teaching of the truth. If we are successful in establishing these two meetings, we will be able to spread to the communities, towns, and villages.</p>
<p>We cannot rely on big meetings in which one person speaks and everyone else listens. In the big gospel meetings that we have held in stadiums, we gained quite a number of people, but in the end only a few remained. Now we must concentrate on the home meetings. When the saints coordinate together to go door-knocking, the result is better than that of the big gospel meetings. Presently the full-time trainees go door-knocking twice a week in the communities; later they will propagate in the towns and villages. If we continue to labor in this way, we will give the Lord a way to advance.</p>
<p>We must clearly see that the change of system is intended to be a thorough change, a complete change. The change of system will enable the saints to have good habits and good character. For example, they will not dress casually for the meetings, but they will dress neatly and properly. When they go door-knocking, they will not be careless. Because we have neglected our outward appearance in the past and did not pay attention to a wise practice that could represent us, we encountered difficulty in every step of our propagation. The truths are here like a pile of diamonds, but we have treated them as if they were dung. This is the reason people do not recognize them as diamonds and do not want them. Now we need a big change to turn everything around so that people will see the diamonds and come for them.</p>
<p>I beseech that we pray much concerning the burden of this message and to ask the Lord for His mercy. We need to call on the Lord and tell Him that we truly need His mercy. In the past He gave us so many rich truths, but if we do not give Him the way today, He will not have a way to advance. May the Lord turn us absolutely and have mercy on us so that we will not receive His riches and grace in vain.</p>
