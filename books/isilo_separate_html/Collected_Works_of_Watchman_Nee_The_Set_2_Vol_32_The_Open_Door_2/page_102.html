Thank the Lord that we saw His protection and presence everywhere we went. After arriving in Tai-Yuen we found a rented place. Thank the Lord for His grace! After conducting meetings in the villages in Ho-Jin, we passed Chu-Wo, Lin-Fen, and came to Tai-Yuen. Everywhere we met seekers of the Lord. We sincerely hope that the Lord would lead some to come to south Shansi to work. May the Lord raise up many more obedient ones. In Ho-Jin County the Lord's table is in three places: Sin-Chun, Shia-Niu-Chun, and Yan-Chun. In each place there are twenty to thirty people. Thank the Lord. Most of the ones we knew from Tai-Yuen have left for other places. Thank the Lord that we can get to know more new brothers and sisters. Please pray much for the work in Tai-Yuen. May the Lord raise up men to bear the overcoming testimony of the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brother and sister in the Lord,<br />Chai En-shang and Chai Ying-fang, April 3</p><h2 class="head2">Chuanchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord. Although Chuanchow was bombed a few times, we were all preserved by the Lord and are all safe. Over the past year the Spirit of the Lord has comforted us with several verses. Proverbs 1:33 says, "But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil." Isaiah 26:3 says, "You will keep the steadfast of mind/In perfect peace/Because he trusts in You." Verse 12 says, "O Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us." Please pray for us so that we will not receive grace in vain or make the ground useless.</p><p>Brothers representing the church in Chuanchow,<br />Yang Shi-chao, Wang Bu-jou, Gu Teh-en, April 13</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brothers Kuo and Liu:</p><p>I have been in Yang-Jia-Wan for over a month. Although I do not see the Spirit's obvious work, He is operating here. First, the Spirit has been guiding us in the matter of prayer. Now we have meetings practically every evening. Every adult and a few children are opening their mouths to pray in the name of the Father. We believe that our God is a God who answers prayer, and soon He will perform great works. Second, there are three co-workers here. They have been enlightened afresh by the Lord and brought to Golgotha, and they have consecrated themselves afresh to the Lord. Presently, the women and children in Yang-Jia-Wan are studying Bible Studies for Beginners. We ask that you pray for me all the time so that I can stand faithfully for the Lord and have a life and an attitude of crucifixion, preaching "Christ, and this One crucified." Concerning the matter of divine healing, I do not doubt, nor dare doubt, its reality. Indeed, God's promise of healing is wonderful. Those who have faith to receive it will see the manifestation of God's glory. However, we should realize and be reminded that we are still in the flesh and still carry weakness. We are still restricted by natural laws. I am referring to our daily life after being healed. We should not overexert ourselves in walking or working. Our Lord rested by the well when He became weary of walking on earth. This teaches us that though He is God, He was limited by His body...Here I cannot help but consider how excellent is the Lord's coming! We will see Him as He is. He will change our body, and we will be like Him. Hallelujah! O Lord, come quickly! Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Yang Dai, March 8</p><h2 class="head2">Chou-Jia-Dien, Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><p>A year ago I was living in Mei-Chuang by myself. At that time I prayed that God would raise up a work in Ch'ang-Teh. After a few months God sent His servant Brother Han Fu-shen...In Ch'ang-Teh, we now have a meeting. But my home is about seventy to eighty miles from Ch'ang-Teh, and I cannot go to the meetings often. I then asked God to raise up His children and work in Chou-Jia-Dien, a small town five or six miles from my home. A few months later God sent His servants Han Fu-shen and Brother Shang to Chou-Jia-Dien. My wife, my mother, my sister, and I often pray and study the Word together. In the middle of the first month, the Lord led us to have a seven-day evangelistic conference, which was followed by a ten-day edification conference. The Lord used Brother Han greatly. The Lord saved my whole family. Glory to His name! The members of the Alliance Church as well as the preacher were greatly touched. We borrowed their hall for our meeting. Starting last Lord's Day, there is a table meeting in my house. We have seven or eight people breaking bread together. Even the missionary and the members of the Alliance Church joined us in the table. They are all beloved of the Lord, and they all love the Lord and desire to learn the truth. From now on there will be regular meetings. We will also be preaching the gospel to our friends and relatives. Please pray for us.</p><p>A weak brother,<br />Mei Han-keh, March 15</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
