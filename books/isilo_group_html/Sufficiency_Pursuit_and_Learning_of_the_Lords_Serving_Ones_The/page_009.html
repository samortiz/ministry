Being between Bethel and Ai</h2>
<p>Genuine spiritual life grows in desolate circumstances. We should not expect to always receive light when we read the Bible, to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence when we pray, to save many sinners, or that our wife, husband, children, parents, and siblings will be spiritual. These expectations are unrealistic. Those who are genuinely spiritual pitch their tent between Bethel and Ai. God does not allow us to be free of desolate situations, that is, to become a monk or an ascetic, nor does He want us to become mystics. God desires that we remain in the status in which we were called (1 Cor. 7:20). Those who have a wife, a husband, children, or a family should remain where they are. They should learn to labor and work with their hands. If we can be normal human beings in our troublesome, complicated, and fallen situations, then we will have the genuine exercise of spirituality. Living between Bethel and Ai should be our normal experience.</p>
<p>We all want the church in our locality to be spiritual, free from problems, full of harmony and God&rsquo;s presence, and in a glorious situation. However, no matter how much we try to maintain the situation, a storm may come, there will be discord, or the flesh surfaces. In other words, Ai always accompanies Bethel. Like Abraham who followed God, we must pass between Bethel and Ai. We will see God&rsquo;s house on one side but a heap of ruins on the other side. No matter how we pray or labor, we should be prepared for desolate situations. The church may be Bethel today but Ai tomorrow. This is a picture of our true situation.</p>
<p>Our outward circumstances in coordination with the operation of God give us the opportunity to develop a genuine spiritual life. We should not expect to be in a situation that is heavenly and without any problems. God did not create us to be human beings in heaven. He ordained that we be human beings on earth. His desire for us to be genuinely spiritual does not mean that we should break away from human relationships. Rather, we need to live and conduct ourselves properly in these relationships.</p>
<p>No matter how much we grow in life and no matter how many visions we see, there will always be a feeling of desolation in us, because we live on earth, remain in our old man, and have the flesh. As long as we are on earth, our circumstances will give us a sense of desolation, a sense of Ai. We are in between Bethel and Ai, and we seek progress. On the one hand, we have a sense of desolation, but on the other hand, we are in the house of God and have the presence of God. On the one hand, we are not satisfied with the ministry of the word, but on the other hand, we receive grace and are supplied. We have weaknesses and desolation, but we also have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. We must leave our spiritual longings and learn to experience God in our desolate situations so that we may have genuine growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE REVELATION<br />
OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We should not have unrealistic spiritual longings, but we should live and serve with a vision. Our vision is the central line of the Bible&mdash;Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ and the Church<br />
Being the Central Line of the Bible</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Revelation of Christ and the Church<br />
in Revelation</h2>
<p>At the beginning of Revelation there are seven golden lampstands, which refer to seven churches in different localities (1:20, 11). In chapter 12 there is a universal woman &ldquo;clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars&rdquo; (v. 1). This woman refers mainly to the church. In contrast to this woman, in chapter 17 there is a great harlot, Babylon the Great (vv. 1-6). The harlot is produced by the union of religion and the world. The ultimate expression of the church, the New Jerusalem, is at the end of Revelation (21:2). The church reveals Christ. In the beginning of Revelation the Son of Man, Christ, is walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands (2:1). At the end of Revelation the Lamb, Christ, is the center of the New Jerusalem (21:22-24). This shows that Christ is the center and the Executor of everything in Revelation. Hence, Revelation presents Christ and the church. For a clearer revelation of Christ and the church we must look at the rest of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Church Being the New Man<br />
Created by God in the Image of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:32 says that Christ and the church are a great mystery. The central line and the key to the revelation of the Bible are Christ and the church. Genesis 1:26 and 27 say that God made man in His image and according to His likeness. These verses imply Christ and the church. God made man in His image. Colossians 1:15 says that the Son &ldquo;is the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; Since the Son, Christ, is the image of God, when God made man in His image, He made man in the image of Christ. Christ was the model, the image, according to which God made man.</p>
<p>In Ephesians the man created by God is no longer Adam of the old creation but the new man of the new creation. God&rsquo;s work in creating man did not stop with the old creation because God&rsquo;s work was not completed in the old creation. God continues to work in man in order to produce the new creation out of the old creation. When the new creation is produced, God&rsquo;s work in man will be completed.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:10 says that the believers are God&rsquo;s masterpiece. Verse 15 says that the believers are the new man. Verse 24 of chapter 4 says that the new man was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality. This word corresponds to Genesis 1:26, which says that God made man in His image. When we compare Genesis 1:26 with Ephesians 2:15 and 4:24, we see that the man created in Genesis ultimately refers to the church. The creation of man points to God&rsquo;s central desire, which is for Christ to be the model for producing the church.</p>
<p>Although there are many believers, God&rsquo;s work is not completed. The first step of God&rsquo;s work is finished; that is, the work of creating the old creation has been completed. However, the second step of God&rsquo;s work is not yet complete, because most believers have not allowed God to complete His work and produce the new creation. They have allowed God to begin His work of the new creation, but this work is still not complete. God is doing a work of further creation. This work is not the creation of the first man in the old creation but that of the second man in the new creation. The new creation is in the image of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Sufficiency, Pursuit, and Learning of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
