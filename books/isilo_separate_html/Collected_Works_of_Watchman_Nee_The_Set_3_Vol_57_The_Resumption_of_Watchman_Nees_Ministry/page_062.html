First Timothy speaks of the pillar of the truth (3:15). Why does it say the pillar of the truth? It is because a pillar is something immovable. It cannot go up or down. It is not like a chair that can be moved from one place to another. If we are not sober, the truth will not have any effect on us. The truth cannot be entrusted to a person who walks according to his feelings. This is a great test. A man must stand on the side of the truth to oppose himself. Only by this can he maintain the truth instead of himself. Those who have never been dealt with do not know what the truth is. Some people lower the truth a little when they are wrong, and lift up the truth a little when they are right. This means that they are like elevators. The truth goes up and down with them. Only those who have dealt with themselves are able to maintain the truth. Praise the Lord, He is the "elevator''; and we are going up and down with Him!</p><p>The reason for so much darkness today is that man sacrifices the truth and forces the truth to yield to him. If you can take the truth as the unique standard and if you have the courage to say that since the Lord has done such and such a thing, you admit that you are wrong, new light will come, and a new way will be opened to you. Otherwise, you will end up thinking that you are the only right Christian on earth and that everyone else has to go along with you. Even the truth will have to go along with you. Those who make allowances for themselves are not of much use in the hand of the Lord. A person must be able to say before the Lord, "This is the truth, and I am wrong.'' If you do not sacrifice the light, the light will uplift you. Blessed are those who can go along with the truth. Only those who judge themselves have the hope of going on. Those who cannot go along with the truth, but instead lower the standard of the truth, will forever live in darkness. Light will have no way to shine on them.</p><p>On the one hand, a man cannot preach the truth unless he has the experience. But on the other hand, a person has to know that the truth has nothing to do with him. If a man is brought to a point that he can no longer withstand God's word and he finds God's word condemning him, he will receive the light. This is the basis of revelation; it is the secret to receiving revelation. Throughout history no one who has received God's light sacrificed God's word. If we are not up to the standard of God's word, we have to catch up, and we have to go along with God's word. If we cannot catch up, we can only say that we have sinned. If we do this, the way ahead will be clear, and we will have more and more light. Otherwise, our reading and preaching of the truth will become vain talk and vain preaching. Man's emotions can never affect God's word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Truth Not Being Affected<br />or Changed by Human Factors</h2><p>If a thing is right, we should do it. If it is not right, we should not do it. If we do not do something just because we forgot to inform a certain brother about it, the truth has slipped away because of our failure to inform him. In this case our informing becomes the truth.</p><p>We have to see that God's word is right and we are wrong. Personally, I can have problems with you, but this must not affect the truth. God's work is always sacrificed because of human relationships. The reason the truth is not absolute is that problems have developed in human relationships. We can sacrifice God's truth today, but what will happen to the next generation? What will happen to those a hundred years after us? If we sacrifice the truth, they will not be able to see the truth. In order to be absolute, a man has to pay a great price. But if we are willing to pay the price to drop ourselves, others will receive the blessing.</p><p>If I want to be near this pillar, the way is not for the pillar to move two feet closer to me; the way is for me to move my chair two feet closer to the pillar. I can move, but the pillar cannot move. I can change, but the pillar cannot change. Many people have changed the truth because of human or historical considerations or because of friendship.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
