   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY 2 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Monday, 6:30 p.m., April 12, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Chu-en asked: Will the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch become another form of a "central" church or "head" church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>SEEING THE BODY LIFE The Holy Spirit Being</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>the Starting Point of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee answered: Our work today does not begin from Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nor does it begin from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our work today begins from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The basic question is the starting point of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Work Being Carried Out in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to realize that the church is a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As such is the case, our work cannot be carried out individually, but it must be carried out in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither can we be a Christian individually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps a person is a well-behaved Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, he must be put together with others before his real condition is made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only those who know the Body will deal with themselves and coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man may have the greatest achievements and may appear to be very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But this should not be mistaken as true progress and true spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only by working with others will we realize whether there is true progress and whether the self is truly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the self assumes the throne, it sees no one but itself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if the self is dealt with, we will see others and will not see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body Being the Test of Spirituality</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must always bear in mind that our life is but a part of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must live together with the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are severe disciplines in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way of the Body is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have not seen the cross do not see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When relatives live far away from one another, they maintain good harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when they move close together, they become enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a person lives in a house by himself, there is comfort and bliss.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when two brothers live together, they have to learn to take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more people live together and the closer they are to one another, the more crosses there are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes a person is put in a situation where he has crosses all over him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What man considers as spiritual progress does not count unless it can pass the test of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The only thing that will count is that which can pass the test of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter how great a person's works are, how many gifts he has, and how much life he possesses, if he is not in the Body, none of these matters count.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only when a person puts himself among the co-workers and the brothers and sisters will he know how much he has been delivered from the self and how much he knows about the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Accepting the Limitations and</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>the Coordination in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first thing we have to know is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once a person sees the Body of Christ, spontaneously he will see coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Body, the Lord has His assigned authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who is an authority?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whoever has the ministry has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ministry is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to accept our own limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must realize that we are only one minister before the Lord and that we have to work together with other ministers before we can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should seek for coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When one member cannot meet the need, he needs the coordination of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only by coordination can we receive the supply from the Body everywhere we go.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A man needs the coordination of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, he needs to accept the limitations of the Body.</S>
