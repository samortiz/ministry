   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO BE SAVED BEING TO RECEIVE GOD'S LIFE IN ADDITION TO MAN'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's salvation is not only for the forgiveness of our sins and the washing away of our filthiness; God's salvation is to give Christ to us at the time we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ enters into us, He becomes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the instant we are saved, we receive Christ as our life; that is, we receive God as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This life in us is different from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We receive another life in addition to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, from the time we are saved, we have two different lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One is the life we had originally, and the other is the life of God, which has been added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Never think that we need to be saved because our life is poor, and therefore God wants to improve our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God saves us, He gives us another life His own life in addition to our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the beginning we did not have God's life, but when we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Savior, God's life was added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic matter with a Christian is that he has God's life added into him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once this life comes into him, he has two different lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is the life he had originally, and the other is the life of God, the life that was added into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his own life there are all kinds of wickedness, such as evil, filthiness, darkness, hatred, jealousy, guile, and covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is his original life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the life that is added into him, because it is the life of God, is good, bright, meek, loving, righteous, and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seeds of the goodness of God are all in this life, which is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life which is added into us is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before we are saved, we live by our own life, the life that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We walk, live, and work entirely according to the life we have originally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In that life we have a little bit of goodness, love, meekness, humility, and other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, that life is not pure; it is mixed with darkness, evil, hatred, jealousy, and all kinds of deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, through our living, we find that in our being we have hatred as well as love and jealousy as well as sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also find that we harm others as well as help others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are so complicated and so contradictory; sometimes we are like bad people, and other times we are like true gentlemen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LIVING NOT BY OUR OWN LIFE BUT BY GOD'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is pride in our humility, hatred in our love, falsehood in our honesty, and there are evil intentions even in our good intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many evil things hidden in all of our good elements.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because man's life has become evil, corrupted, and filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is impossible for man's life to be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, even if man's life were not evil or filthy, man's life would still be man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how good man's life is, it still is not God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians are people who have received God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once a person is saved, he has Christ, God, and God's life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From that time on, God's life is in him not for him to change his outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, God wants him to live by God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Formerly he lived by his own life, but now God wants him to live by God's life in him instead of by his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may use the following illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past we lit kerosene lamps, but now we have lamps which run on electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, many people, owing to their habit of lighting kerosene lamps, still prefer lighting kerosene lamps instead of switching on electric lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the question is not whether or not the light shines but what the source of the shining is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot assume that once the light shines, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must also ask, "Does this shining come from kerosene or from electricity?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our life was formerly a "kerosene lamp," but after we were saved, God's life came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was like the installation of an electric lamp into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, instead of using the "kerosene lamp," we should switch to the "electric lamp."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all know that if a kerosene lamp is not shining, it will not smoke; however, the more the kerosene lamp shines, the more it smokes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is both light and smoke in the kerosene lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, in our natural life there is both good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more we try to do good by ourselves, the more mistakes we commit; that is, the more we "shine," the more we "smoke."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our being there is good and there is also evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In fact, our natural life is simply the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's intention is not for us to forsake evil and to do good by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is man's concept, not God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's intention is that we would live not by our own life but by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we live by God's life, we will "shine" but not "smoke."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we walk by God's life, we will immediately see that there is only good and no evil in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, when we live by God's life, we live by God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way what we live out is not only good but also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is expressed through us is God's nature and His flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we live by our own life, we may do good or evil either way it is lived out by our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>People may touch the goodness in us, but they cannot touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They may not notice any wickedness in us, but neither can they see God's nature in us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is because at the most we have only improved our behavior; the source of our life within remains unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Strictly speaking, this is not to be Christians but to be moralists.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christians are not merely ethical; they also live by God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christians have Christ as their life, and they live by Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result, what they live out is not merely something good or ethical but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must be clear that since we are saved, we now have Christ in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For example, if we have a body that is without life, we will be unable to speak, think, see, hear, sit, or walk.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our whole being will be unable to move.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The reason why we can move and think is that we have life within us, and all of our actions are according to this life and are of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>That Christ is our life means that all of our actions, thoughts, words, and doings are according to Christ and are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our moving is Christ's moving in us, our speaking is Christ's speaking in us, and our thinking is Christ's thinking in us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our entire living and walk are according to Christ in us; we do everything by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not think that this is merely a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We all must grasp this basic point firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A Christian is one who has Christ in him as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Baptism is being immersed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What is bread breaking?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Bread breaking is to eat Christ to eat the Lord's body and to drink the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is to eat and drink of the Lord Himself and to receive the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The basic principle of the Christian living is to be in Christ, by Christ, and of Christ for the gaining of Christ.</S>
