   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now that you are clear about the significance of the feet, we have to go on to consider the meaning of defiled feet.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Defiled feet are feet that have to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not wrong for the feet to be defiled; this is something that is inevitable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This defilement has nothing to do with sin; sinning is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not talking about sin, we are talking about the things that separate us from God, the things that tire us out spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is having defiled feet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose we come to the meeting and say something in an old and habitual way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we have opened up our mouth, nothing is touching us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Or we may be reading the Bible and know what we are reading, yet we may have no feeling about what we have read.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is having defiled feet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can summarize defiled feet with a few words staleness in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Clean feet, however, denote fresh fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day someone said to me, "Mr. Nee, when I was in Chuenchow, I had a wonderful time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I felt that the Lord was very precious to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But today all those feelings are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I still believe in the Lord, I still pray to the Lord, I still love Him, and I am still consecrated to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have not lost any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet I must admit that something within me is not the same as it was before."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is having defiled feet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A man defiles his feet through contact and communication with the world, and through working and conducting business in that realm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you ask such a one if he has sinned, he may answer, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Outwardly he is the same as he was before, but inwardly he is different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can still say that the Lord is precious and that he loves the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this only describes his condition last year, the year before last, or five or ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How many can say today that they treasure the Lord and love the Lord as much as they did five or ten years ago?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people have to say that they do not have the same feeling that they had a year ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their feet are defiled, and they have become weary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is spiritual weariness; it is the loss of spiritual freshness and vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Lord says that we need foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What does foot-washing mean?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It means recovering our former feelings, bringing us back to the freshness of life, and giving us fresh strength to treasure what we previously treasured.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the meaning of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord that He washes our feet all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times when we speak, our words do not match our inward feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today many believers in Christ have become stagnant in their spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They sing, praise, and pray reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes this is the result of sin, but many times this is not the result of any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They simply have defiled feet, and they have become spiritually enervated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to realize that the Lord wants us to be fresh all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why He says that He leads us to the green pastures Psa 23:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have a brother in Shanghai who is a manual laborer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He lost his job a few months ago but recently found another job.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His work involves cutting grass.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For every thousand catties a Chinese unit of weight of grass he cuts, he gets a dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the grass is dried, it is bundled up into bundles of six hundred catties and sent to the dairy farms.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He gets fifty cents a day for this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He cuts, dries, and delivers all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Last month I met him while he was drying the grass and asked him about his job.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said, "I have to dry the grass and deliver it to the dairy farms.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The farms store it in their barns and feed the cows with it in winter."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I then said, "The dairy farmers feed the cows with yellow grass, but the Lord feeds us with green grass."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord wants us to be fresh; He wants us to be fresh every day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may have been yellow yesterday, but we can be green again today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may have been yellow this morning, but we can be green this afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord is fresh running water; He does not flow for five minutes and then stop.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He flows continuously, daily, monthly, and yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is not a minute in which He is short.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is always fresh, and He is constantly refreshing us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the life that the Lord is leading us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here is power, joy, peace, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only by living this way can we express the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the victory at Jericho, there is still the victory at Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After great victories, there are still small, daily victories.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This should be our daily experience before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible says that Saul was taller than any of the people from his shoulders and upward 1 Sam 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet God was not pleased with his reign.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, God did not choose him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, He chose David to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible does not indicate David's height; it merely says that he was ruddy and of a beautiful countenance 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This implies freshness, like the freshness of a newborn baby whose face does not have any wrinkles; there is freshness and vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God wants our life to be fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Psalm 1 says that the blessed man is one who is like a tree planted beside streams of water, yielding fruit in its season, and whose foliage does not wither v. 3 . We have leaves, which are our outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may be patient, meek, humble, and perfect in our conduct and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the question is whether this conduct and virtues are green or whether they are wilting and yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Are they fresh, or are they old?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Leaves denote our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we are not under the fresh operation of the Holy Spirit, we will be doing the same things that we have done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The result will surely not be green and fresh, but dry and old.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A person may have risen at five o'clock in the morning yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He may do the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But yesterday he felt God's presence very near to him, yet today he does not touch Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Outwardly, he is doing the same thing, but inwardly the feeling is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The inward freshness is gone because the leaves have dried up like the things in Noah's ark that belonged to the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They are not like the fresh olive branch that appeared after the flood receded.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Such people are of little use to the Lord.</S>
