TO ENJOY GOD AS ONE&rsquo;S ALL</h2>
<p>If we learn to assimilate God in our spirit, we will experience Him as everything, and He will be whatever we need. As we assimilate Him this way, we will discover that God is our comfort when we need comfort. He is our power when we need power. He is the word when we need a word. He is light when we need light. He is our patience when we need patience. He is love when we need love. He is holiness when we need holiness. He is our way when we need a way. He is wisdom when we need wisdom. All parents need forbearance toward their children. Once we receive God, He becomes forbearance to us. All children need to honor and obey their parents. Once we receive God into us, there is honor and obedience. Our God is everything to us according to our need. When we assimilate Him, He is whatever we need. This is wonderful!</p>
<p>In a traditional wedding a pastor, based on the Scriptures, asks the husband to love his wife and the wife to submit to her husband. However, it is difficult to find a married couple who truly love one another and are obedient to one another. This is because the love that the husband needs in order to love his wife is not something that issues from teachings, nor is the obedience that the wife needs in order to obey her husband something that issues from instructions. Love is simply God Himself, and submission is also God Himself. When a husband exercises his spirit, even a little, to breathe in God, he cannot help but love his wife. Even the most unlovable wife becomes lovable. This is because God Himself is simply love. In the same way if the wife breathes in God, the Triune God, the Father who is in the Son and the Son who is the Spirit, enters into her. There is no need for teaching; she will simply obey in an absolute way. When God enters the husband, He becomes the sweet love in the husband, and when God enters the wife, He becomes the absolute submission in the wife.</p>
<p>Have we ever noticed the number of times the Bible speaks of what God is? God is light. God is power. God is food. God is the living water. God is healing. God is peace. The Lord says that He is the way, the truth, and the life. He is the light of the world. He is everything. Do we need boldness? God is our boldness. We are not bold because we do not have God. When we are filled with God through drinking, we will be bold. We do not have eloquence because we do not have God. In Greek the word <em>eloquence</em> is the same as the word for <em>speaking.</em> Speaking is the Word, and the Word is God; hence, eloquence is God. When we say that we do not have eloquence, we are saying that we do not have God. The brothers who give messages should no longer complain that they do not have eloquence. Saying that they do not have eloquence proves that they do not have enough God. When we are filled with God, we will surely be full of eloquence and utterance. Do we need to be persuasive? God is our persuasiveness. We do not need to worry whether our speaking is eloquent or persuasive if we are filled and satisfied with God before we speak and if we continue to breathe Him in while we speak. I do not need to speak too much regarding this. Our lack of anything is a sign of our lack of God. As long as we are filled with God, we will not lack anything. God is everything. The apostle Paul said that he could do all things through the power of the One who empowered him. God is everything. There is no thing that He is not. As long as we enjoy Him, assimilate Him, and abide in Him, we can do all things. The key lies in our receiving God with our spirit. We need to learn to receive God all day long with our spirit. We need to learn to exercise our spirit even when we are walking on the street. In our busiest moments we need to learn to fellowship with God in our spirit. Please do not misunderstand me, but we need to learn to exercise our spirit even when we lose our temper. If we learn to fellowship with God in our spirit while we are losing our temper, our temper will vanish. Whenever we are about to lose our temper, we should take a deep breath of God, and the temper will surely disappear.</p>
<p>Therefore, in any circumstance and at any time, we need to learn to contact God and enjoy Him in our spirit. God is the omnipresent Spirit. He is also the all-pervading Spirit; no place is too distant for Him to reach. No matter what our condition is, He is willing to draw near to us. Even when we think that we are at our worst, He is willing to be received by us. We should realize that we can receive Him and touch Him in our spirit, even at our lowest moments. Once He enters, all our problems are solved. I believe we now understand that even though we may have myriads of needs, our unique solution is the living God. He is everything. He is the solution to whatever we need. He is all in all!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
