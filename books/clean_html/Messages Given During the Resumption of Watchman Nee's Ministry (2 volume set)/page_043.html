<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CENTER OF GOD'S TRUTH</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (3)</H1><p>Date:January 11 to 12, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TALK AFTER DINNER ON JANUARY 11</H2><P>Brother Lee: Men beget children according to a law. As long as a person fulfills that law, he will beget children, whether or not the begetting is a legal one. In the same way, saving people through the gospel is a law. As long as there are those who preach the gospel, there are those who will be saved. This will happen spontaneously. But the question today is not one of being saved or not being saved. Rather, it is a question of the method we use, of whether or not the methods are up to the standard of God's desire.</P><P>Many of God's children have been spoiled by Christianity today. They are like a piece of material, which is best left alone to itself, because once it has been touched and has been made into some kind of vessel, one can never change it anymore. It is better to leave a piece of fabric alone than to cut it into something. Once it has been cut into something, nothing can any longer be done to it. The same is true with Christianity's work on some people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TALK AFTER BREAKFAST ON JANUARY 12</H2><P>God is going onward all the time; He never goes backward. In every age, He raised up men who would afford Him a way to go on, men like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and so forth. God's works are different for different people. God would never raise up another David, and He would never raise up another one like George MÃ¼ller to do a similar work. Of course, these people can give us some principles of conduct. But this does not mean that we have to imitate them and be the same as they were. In northern China, a few people tried to imitate Madame Guyon. At the beginning I dared not say much, but in the end I realized that this would not work.</P><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi asked: In 1934, Brother Nee spoke concerning Christ as the centrality of God. Brother Sparks also emphasized this same thing. Is this the same as what Brother Lee is speaking this time, that is, God working Himself into man, and man being filled with God? Or is what Brother Lee is speaking another aspect of God's centrality?</P><P>Brother Lee answered: There is no difference between these two things; they are the same thing. No other truth is more crucial than this truth today. Christ is God's centrality; this is the overall center. At the same time, the center of God's creation of man is His working Himself into man. This is for the purpose of establishing Christ as the centrality of all things. The Bible shows us this fact in a clear way.</P><P>Concerning the question of the Triune God, we can say that "God" is the personal name of the Triune God, that "Christ" is the official name of the Triune God, and that the "Holy Spirit" is the administrative name of the Triune God. It is better for us to say the Triune God than to say the Trinity. The end of Matthew mentions the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This name is singular. The relationship between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit can be illustrated by the sun, the sunlight, and the heat. It can also be illustrated by the water, the ice, and the vapor.</P><P>Sister Pearl Wang: Christ is the embodiment of God, whereas the Holy Spirit is the embodiment of Christ.</P><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi: Brother Nee said before in Canton that the Holy Spirit is the second coming of Christ.</P><P>Brother Lee: Darby was a great teacher. But he did one thing wrong, and that was to excommunicate Newton. Newton believed that all believers will have to pass through the great tribulation before they will be raptured.</P><P>Two hundred years ago, the Brethren released many biblical truths, but they did not touch the center. Instead, they only paid attention to the study of biblical teachings.</P><P>In God's eyes, all His works are done in a corporate way. His salvation is a corporate salvation. In the Old Testament, salvation for Noah was directed toward his whole household. Salvation also came to the whole house of Israel. Although God's work in the church today has its individual aspects, it is all for the whole Body. God never saves people individually.</P>
