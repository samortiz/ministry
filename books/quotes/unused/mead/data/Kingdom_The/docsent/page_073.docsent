   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIRST CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many of those who have been involved in the Pentecostal or charismatic things say that 1 Corinthians is a book concerning speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They quote 1 Corinthians 14:18 where Paul said that he spoke with tongues more than all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From this they infer that we should all speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No doubt there is such a verse in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, let us consider 1 Corinthians 4:17 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 17 says, "As I teach every where in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you read the context, you will see that this verse has nothing to do with speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 20 says, "For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we put these two verses together and consider the context, we will realize that the church is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 17 Paul says, "Everywhere in every church"; in verse 20 he says, "the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After referring to his teaching in every church, Paul said that the kingdom is not in word but in power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Church and kingdom are used interchangeably, proving that the proper church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The situation of Christianity today is abnormal, making it difficult for us to see the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many have held the concept that today is the age of the church and that sometime in the future will be the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some teach that it is not necessary or possible to have the proper church today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Few know what the church is, and still fewer know that the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CHURCH LIFE BEING THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In both Romans and 1 Corinthians Paul indicates clearly that the church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew shows the same thing: "I will build my church..and I will give to you the keys of the kingdom" Matt 16:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church built by the Lord Jesus is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The seed that is sown in Matthew grows in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, Paul also tells us that the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus spoke about the church as the kingdom in a simple way because Matthew contains the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Epistles Paul expounded upon the church as the kingdom in a fuller way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need the whole book of Romans and the whole book of 1 Corinthians in order to know the church as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FEEDING FOR THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based upon this we come to 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, the word "kingdom" is not found in this chapter, but other verses in this book indicate that the church life is the kingdom 4:17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First of all, Paul says, "I fed you."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to have the church as the kingdom, we need the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not say, "I taught you"; he said, "I fed you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not need the teaching; we need the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both the milk and the meat mentioned in verse 2 are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Paul says, "I fed you with milk," it means that he fed them with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How we long to see the leading ones in all the local churches constantly feeding the younger ones with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although Paul was a great teacher, he was also a wonderful feeder.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He fed people with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul goes on to say that he planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth v. 6 . Eventually, Paul said that by the grace given to him, he was a wise masterbuilder v. 10 . Paul was a marvelous person: he was a feeder, a planter, and a builder.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For God's kingdom in the local churches today we also need to feed, to plant, and to build.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to feed people, and we need to sow the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to plant vegetables which by growth and transformation will become minerals gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How could the plantation become minerals?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What kind of tree did Paul plant that, as it grew, became gold, silver, and precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul says, "Ye are God's farm, ye are God's building" v. 9, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>. How can we reconcile these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The farm is something of vegetables; the building is primarily of stones and minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can we be both vegetables and minerals?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The answer is that the life which grows within us is a transforming life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It not only grows, but it also transforms.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While it grows, it transforms, and the more it grows, the more it transforms.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This life transforms us from vegetables to minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we can see that Paul's concept in 1 Corinthians 3 is exactly the same as the Lord's concept in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have seen already, the first four parables in Matthew 13 concern the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The seed grows, matures, and produces fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The next two parables concern the treasure and the pearl, representing transformed items.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, in Matthew 13 there are both growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 1 Corinthians 3 there is also growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The concept is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Following Matthew 13, the Lord told us that the stones are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"You are a stone, and..I will build my church" Matt 16:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>. In Matthew we see the growth with transformation to produce stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Matthew all of this was in seed form and was somewhat undeveloped, but the growth and the blossoming of this seed in 1 Corinthians 3 is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Following the growth, there is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While the plant grows, it is transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones to be the materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Eventually the planter becomes the feeder, and the feeder becomes the builder.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The kingdom is a matter of planting, feeding, watering, growing, transforming, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Finally Paul says, "Ye are the temple of God" 1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not a Christian organization or religious society; this is the church, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The kingdom is something that is planted, that grows, that is transformed, and that is built up into the very temple of God.</S>
