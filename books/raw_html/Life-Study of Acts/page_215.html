<h2 class="head1">THE BASE THOUGHT AND FOLLY<br />OF THE SAILORS AND SOLDIERS AND<br />THE ASCENDANT WISDOM AND CARE OF PAUL</h2><p>In 27:27-44 we have a contrast between the base thought and folly of the sailors and the soldiers and the ascendant wisdom and care of Paul. This indicates that those without Christ are base and foolish. The sailors attempted to flee out of the ship, but they were caught by Paul, who was watching over them like a king. &ldquo;And when the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship and were lowering the small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow, Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved. Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall off&rdquo; (vv. 30-32). Paul told the centurion and the soldiers that they could not be saved unless the sailors remained in the ship. It seems that Paul was the one in charge, giving orders to his &ldquo;army&rdquo; to do what was necessary.</p><p>Verses 33 and 34 continue, &ldquo;And until day was about to come, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing. Wherefore I encourage you to take some food; for this is for your salvation; for not a hair will perish from the head of any one of you.&rdquo; They had been watching over the storm for fourteen days, and they did not have the heart to eat anything. Now Paul encouraged them to take food, for it would be for their salvation. The word &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; here means that without eating the men would not be saved from the storm. They needed to eat in order to have the strength to swim and to do what was necessary once they were on land.</p><p>Verse 35 says, &ldquo;And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat.&rdquo; Here Paul conducted himself like a king, or at least like the head of a large family. He gave thanks for the food and went on to eat. The storm was still raging, the boat was shaking, and they were afraid of losing their lives. Nevertheless, Paul told them to cheer up, to be at peace, and to take some food in order to have the strength they needed. Then, in front of them all, he took the lead to eat. All the others were frightened and did not have the heart to eat. For this reason, Paul set up an example and seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I am cheerful and at peace. I encourage you to follow me, for I am a man living Christ.&rdquo; Because Paul took the lead to be cheerful and to eat, &ldquo;all became cheerful, and they took food&rdquo; (v. 36). According to verse 37, there were in all &ldquo;two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship.&rdquo; As we have indicated, they all were actually subjects in the kingdom ruled over by Paul.</p><p>In 27:30 the sailors wanted to flee, and in verse 42 the soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners: &ldquo;Now the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest anyone should swim away and escape.&rdquo; However, the Lord in His sovereignty protected Paul. &ldquo;The centurion, intending to bring Paul safely through, prevented them from their intention and ordered those who were able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to the land; and the rest, some on planks, and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were brought safely through onto the land&rdquo; (vv. 43-44). What the centurion did in keeping the soldiers from their intention was once again the sovereignty of the Lord to preserve His servant&rsquo;s life. Because of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign protection of Paul, all those on the ship were brought safely to land, to an island called Malta (28:1).</p>
