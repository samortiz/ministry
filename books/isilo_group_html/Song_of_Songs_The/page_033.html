Lips&#151;Signifying Expression</H2><P>If teeth signify reception, lips must signify expression. If teeth are for food, lips must be for expressing what has been digested. In the new creation, the Lord cares not only for our insight, our consecration, and our power of receiving, but for our words also.</P><P>There are two ways to explain "a thread of scarlet." (1) It signifies redemption (Josh. 2:21), and (2) authority (Matt. 27:28-29). On the one hand, it is a sign of cleansed lips (Isa. 6:6-7). On the other hand, it signifies that all speakings are under the authority of the King and that the lips are under the control of the King's rule. It is not like Psalm 12:4, which says, "With our tongue will we prevail;/Our lips are our own: Who is lord over us?" Only lips that have passed through redemption, that are subject to the Lord's authority, and that do not speak according to one's own will have a "comely" speech (S.S. 4:3). The teeth are mentioned before the lips because if something wrong is taken in, whatever comes out will surely be wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Temples&#151;Signifying Outward Beauty</H2><P>The "temples" can be translated as "cheeks." Cheeks are the place where beauty is displayed. All our outward expressions (joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and so forth) are seen through the cheeks.</P><P>"Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks." This is not a whole pomegranate, but an open one. In the Bible, the pomegranate signifies the abundance of life. Pomegranates are full of seeds, and every seed is juicy, red, sweet, and beautiful. This means that the outward beauty of the believers comes from an overflow of the Lord's life. Still, everything must be veiled from the world's eyes. This is the significance of the pomegranate being within the locks or the veils. In other words, the only One who is aware of our beauty is the Lord. Although we should have a good testimony from those outside, and although our light should shine before men, such acts are not for our exhibition. Our expression is only before the Lord. The principle of a believer's living is forever one of being within the veil and behind closed doors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Neck&#151;Signifying the Submission of the Will</H2><P>The neck signifies man's will. The Bible speaks of those who walk according to their self-will, who are stubborn and proud, as stiff-necked ones (Isa. 3:16). Hence, the neck denotes man's will under God. The Lord considers the submission of man's will as the most beautiful thing in man. In this verse there are two aspects of a submissive will. First, "Thy neck is like the tower." A tower describes a condition that is opposite to that of a hunchback. Those whose necks are not straight are hunchbacked. In the Bible, hunchbacks are bound by Satan to face the earth all the time (Luke 13:11, 16). The neck being like a tower means that the person is released; there is no bondage of Satan and no love for the world. A tower also means strength. The maiden's will has been strengthened by God to the point that she no longer loves the world and is no longer affected by Satan. Second, "Thy neck is like the tower of David." This is not an ordinary tower, but the tower of David. In addition to the sense of strength and deliverance, we also see that the maiden's will has been brought into complete submission to David. Her strength lies in her submission to Christ, and her deliverance also lies in her submission to Christ. We should all realize the importance of being taken captive by Christ.</P><P>What is the use of this tower? It is "builded for an armory." This means that spiritual warfare is fought for the purpose of claiming the will. The armory stored within the tower signifies the victory of Christ for the preservation of the believers' will from the enemy's usurpation. However, the weapons are not for attack, but for defense. Therefore, only bucklers and shields are mentioned. Bucklers and shields are for protection. "A thousand" means that the number is great. "Mighty men" denotes strength. In summary, this verse indicates that the maiden is willing to submit completely to David's will. She is as strong as a tower in carrying out David's will. She is on guard vigilantly and does not allow the enemy to usurp her submissive will.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
