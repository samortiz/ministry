   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One of the devices of the devil is to get the children of God to accept weakness, because of the "weakness of the Cross" 2 Corinthians 13.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>3, 4 , but that is the human side towards men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the spiritual sphere the rousing word is "BE STRONG!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the earthly side, "I will boast of my weakness." said Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in facing the foe "Be strong!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"From henceforth be STRONG!"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not say "Try to be strong," it says "BE strong."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God says BE, He gives the power to be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "Let there BE light," and there was light!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So whenever God says to you "BE so-and-so," say "Amen, I AM so-and-so " i.e. IT IS SO! God speaks the word, you appropriate it, and it becomes fact as you act it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GOD does it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So God says "Be strong!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Let the weak say, I AM STRONG!"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why have you to to say it?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because in the spiritual realm, words create.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ said, "He shall have whatever he saith."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the spiritual realm there are no empty words; what you say is what comes about.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus you need to be careful of your words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you walk as a "natural man" in the earthly sphere you may say words that have little effect, but if you walk in the spiritual sphere you will need to watch that you do not contradict your faith by your words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you say "God tells me to 'BE strong,' and therefore</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am strong</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>by His strength," then strength comes in. The devil knows the laws of the spiritual sphere, and he whispers, "Oh, you do feel bad today!" and you say, "I am bad!" But God says, "Be strong," then you say, "By faith in God I am strong!" Satan whispers, "You are going to break down," and you say, "I believe I shall break down!" and you find yourself really going "down." This is the law in the spiritual sphere, yet few of us understand the power of words in that sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Let the weak SAY, I am strong!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BE STRONG!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No; "IN THE LORD."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is a position.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not outside the Lord, but is "In the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Stand "in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Take care you never stand anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Keep your faith set on the fact:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"I am in Christ"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>and Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not meeting things alone I am personally weak, but Christ is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am powerless, but Christ is mighty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am strong in Christ; I have His strength, His power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"I stand in the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not remembering their place in Christ, and "with Christ in God," many children of God are so "weak."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You place them in an exposed position in the battle, and they run away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You hardly dare tell them some things you have to conquer by prayer, because they get so frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is appalling that God has such a weak Church, weak in the conflict with sin and Satan, weak in its attitude to the world, all because it has not learnt the inner message of the Cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"HIS MIGHT."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us meet the lion of hell with this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God says, "Be strong," and "stand" in the "strength of His might."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It will take every bit of fear away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is "MIGHT."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Exactly the same word that Paul uses in Ephesians 1 that Christ was "raised from the dead" by the "might" of God by the "strength of HIS MIGHT."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us therefore go forward with God in steady hourly Victory, until the Lord comes, and we are gathered together unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Addendum THE FOUNDATION OF THE VICTORIOUS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sixth of Romans is not an aspect of the truth, but the FOUNDATION TRUTH upon which every believer must stand, to know anything about victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It not only reveals the very heart of Calvary, but the very heart of the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Calvary means the death-identification of the believer with Christ, so that he lives and moves in a spiritual sphere in resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For in that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>LIKEWISE RECKON YE also..." writes the Apostle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we need to see too that there is a life side to the sixth of Romans, the resurrection side.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the resurrection side of the Cross, "death" hath no more dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The negative side of "death" should not be dwelt upon to the exclusion of the positive LIFE SIDE of union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The death is to be reckoned an accomplished fact, every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But "Christ being raised, dieth no more."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is ALIVE, and the believer identified by faith with Him in death, is united to Him in His life on the life-side of the Cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The believer must reckon to everything that he HAS died not that he is going to die.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he again and again asks God to "put to death" some one point over and over again, he will never realize the positive life power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Reader are you saying, "I have not died' to this and that."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Take your position now on Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>6, and then "reckon" yourself "ALIVE UNTO GOD," and as you are alive unto God, you will surely come into the conflict with the spiritual foes in the spiritual sphere, described in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>10-18, and standing on the foundation fact of Romans 6, go on to victory.</S>
