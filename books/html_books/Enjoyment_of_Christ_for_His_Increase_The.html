<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in a conference in Sacramento, California, in February of 1963. The messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST AS LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-27; 2:8-9; Col. 1:15; 3:4; 1 John 5:12; John 1:4; 6:35, 57, 63; 2 Cor. 4:7; Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION TO PUT CHRIST<br />
AS LIFE INTO MAN</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the Scriptures, two matters are mentioned in relation to man&mdash;the image of God and the life of God. In the first chapter of Genesis, we are told that man was created according to the image of God (vv. 26-27). Then in the second chapter we are told that after man was created by God, he was put before the tree of life (vv. 8-9). In the Scriptures, the tree of life is a symbol of God as life to man. This is a clear picture revealing to us that although man was made according to the image of God, at that time he did not have the life of God. Man had the image of God by creation, but he did not yet possess the life of God. He was placed in front of the life of God, but the life of God was outside of him. We should be very clear about this picture. Although the life of God is before man, it is nevertheless outside of man.</p>
<p>What is the image of God according to the Scriptures? Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ, the Son of God, is the image of the invisible God. That man was made according to the image of God means that man was made according to Christ. Romans 5:14 says that the man Adam was a figure of Christ. Man was made according to the image of God, and the very image of God is Christ Himself. Man as a figure of Christ may be compared to a photograph. A photograph of a person is made according to that person; it is a picture of that person. Because man was created according to Christ, he became a figure of Christ. In today&rsquo;s language, man is a photograph of Christ. With a picture there is the image of the person but not the life of that person. This is exactly the same with Adam. When Adam was created, he was created according to Christ, so he became a picture of Christ. Although he had the image of Christ, he did not have the life of Christ. No photographer today has the intention to put life into a photograph, but God put man before the tree of life with the intention that man would partake of the tree of life and receive the life of God.</p>
<p>God created man according to His own image, which is Christ, with the intention of putting Christ into him as life. What then is the life of God? The life of God is Christ Himself. Christ is both the image of God and the life of God. The Gospel of John tells us that Christ is the life (11:25). John&rsquo;s first Epistle tells us that he who has the Son, Christ, has the life, and he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life (1 John 5:12). God&rsquo;s eternal intention, His divine purpose, was to create man according to Christ, as a picture of Christ, so that man would take Christ as his life.</p>
<p>However, man was a failure in this matter. Instead of partaking of the tree of life, man took in the tree of knowledge. We all know this sad story. We praise the Lord that one day the Lord came into this world, died on the cross for our redemption, and released Himself as the Spirit to be life to us. Now, whoever believes in Him receives Him and possesses Him as life. As Christians, we have Christ as our life (Col. 3:4). Now we are no longer merely photos of Christ; we also have the life of Christ within us. Therefore, we are the living expression of Christ.</p>
<p>Today not only unbelievers but even Christians have a wrong concept about the relationship between us and God. When we think about God, our concept is that we need to do many good things to please Him. This is absolutely wrong. According to the revelation in the Scriptures, we were made according to the image of Christ to be photos of Christ, and the one thing we must do is to receive Christ as our life. Once we receive Him as our life, Christ lives within us to make us a living expression of Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING A VESSEL TO CONTAIN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Although we have the image of Christ, by creation we are just empty vessels (Rom. 9:21). We were made as vessels for the purpose of receiving Christ. Man can be compared to a glove. A glove is made according to the image of a hand because it is a vessel made to contain the hand. Without the hand the glove is empty. This is the reason that those who are without Christ always feel that human life is empty, a vanity of vanities. Just as a glove is a container and the hand is the content, so man is a vessel, a container for Christ. Without Christ as our content and our fullness, we are empty persons, empty vessels.</p>
<p>As Christians, we have Christ in us. Now the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; and the &ldquo;glove&rdquo; are one. The glove is the container, and the hand is the content. The glove expresses the hand, and the hand fills the glove. Moreover, the glove is satisfied with the hand in it. We have to realize that we are a container of Christ, a vessel for Christ (2 Cor. 4:7). We should not try to do anything to please God. God&rsquo;s intention is not for us to do something good to please Him but that we would receive Christ as our life. If my glove does not receive my hand but merely tries to do things for my hand, I would say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do all these things. I only wish to put my hand into you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many teachings today in Christianity that tell people to do good. When I was young, I was a genuine, regenerated Christian, but I was taught in a wrong way. I was taught to be humble and patient, and I paid the price to be patient. I was taught not only to do good but to be good. However, the more I tried to be patient, the more I was impatient. The more I tried to be humble, the more I was proud. The more I tried to be good and do good, the more I found myself empty and dissatisfied. The more I tried to do something to please God, the more I felt that God was very far from me. Later on, the Lord opened my eyes and caused me to see that this was the wrong way. The right way is neither to be good nor to do good, neither to be humble nor to be patient. The right way is to take Christ as life. The right way is to take Christ and receive Him as life. After receiving Him as our life, we must learn to take Him as our daily food. We must learn how to feed on Him, how to drink Him, and how to keep ourselves in contact with Him. We must learn how to take Him day by day and moment by moment as our life supply. We can forget about being humble, being patient, being good, and doing good and simply contact Christ as life day by day and moment by moment.</p>
<p>We all must see this very clear and simple picture that we were made as vessels to contain Christ. There is nothing for us to do but to take Christ as our life, to take Him as our daily food, and to take Him as our life supply moment by moment. This is the one thing we must learn. I have met thousands of Christians in many places throughout the world. I have realized in talking with them that all of them know many things. They know something in Genesis and something in Revelation. They know some matters in John and in Luke. They are acquainted with some things in the Old Testament and some things in the New Testament. They can talk with you about many things in Christianity. However, I tried to minister in many places the matter of Christ as life to us, but many believers did not care for this. They knew the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 6:35 and 57. In verse 35 the Lord said that He is the bread of life, and in verse 57 He said that he who eats Him shall live because of Him. I asked them to tell me how the Lord can be bread to us and how we can eat Him. If Christ Himself said that we can eat Him and live because of Him, how then can we eat Him? Although I tried to speak this in many places, not one person could tell me the exact meaning, the real meaning, of eating Christ, and not one could tell me from their experience how to take Christ as their daily food. Although Christ said that he who eats Him shall live because of Him, how can we really eat Christ? Is it merely by reading the Bible? Many people read the Bible thoroughly, yet they do not know the way to take Christ as their food.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO CONTACT THE LORD AND RECEIVE HIM</h2>
<p>In order to eat the Lord, we have to open our mouth. Perhaps early in the morning we have some prayer and fellowship with the Lord. Many of us in our morning time offer a prayer to the Lord asking Him to help us to do this and to do that. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, today is a new day. I give this day to You. Lord, help me to do this and that.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, this may not be wrong. However, if the Lord opens our eyes, we will realize that when we go to the Lord early in the morning each day, we should not go to Him to ask Him to help us to do many things. Rather, we must go to the Lord to contact Him and to receive Him. We have to absorb something of the Lord into us again and again. We have to feed on Him and drink of Him repeatedly. We must go to the Lord as we would go to a big breakfast. After we have contacted the Lord for a period of time, we will be filled with Him. We will be satisfied and refreshed. The proper way to be a Christian is not to ask the Lord to help us to do things. The proper way to be a Christian is to take the Lord moment by moment as our fullness and our life supply. This is something we have to learn. In the past we learned many things improperly. The best way for us to be normal Christians is to be simple, taking Christ as our life day by day.</p>
<p>It would be very easy for me merely to speak many things to you from the Scriptures. I could have a Bible study about Genesis or the Psalms or the book of Revelation. But I have no confidence that I can convince you to be simple Christians. We know so much according to our mentality, but we experience Christ so little in spirit. Therefore, it is rather difficult to convince someone to be a simple Christian. A simple Christian is just like a child. Children do not care for much knowledge; they simply come to the table and eat something. I have been eating for nearly sixty years. Although I still do not know what vitamin A, vitamin B, and vitamin C are, I live very well because I eat well. Every morning I take two eggs, one cup of milk, two pieces of toast, and one bowl of cereal. If you ask me what this food contains, I would say that I do not know. I do not know what the ingredients are, but I know that they are good for eating. I do not believe that there is a dietitian who knows everything about food. It is too mysterious.</p>
<p>As to the matters of the divine life, they are also very mysterious. It is not an easy thing to understand the Scriptures. This book has been in my hands for forty years. I have studied it, read it, and meditated in it day after day. Even up to today I do not fully understand this book. Thirty-five years ago I thought that I understood the types and prophecies. I understood that of the seventy weeks mentioned in Daniel 9, there were the first sixty-two, then seven weeks more, and then the last week, which is divided into two parts. The last half of the last week lasts for three and a half years, which is equal to forty-two months or one thousand two hundred sixty days. I thought that at that time I understood these figures. However, today I would tell you that I do not thoroughly understand the Scriptures. Yet day by day I select something out of them to eat and enjoy for my satisfaction. Day by day it is so sweet, so fresh, and so refreshing. Although I do not thoroughly understand it, I eat a lot.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING CHRIST WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>One day a sister came to me and asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, would you tell me how to be a good wife?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Sister, you have come to the wrong person. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I think you had better go to Confucius. He would know the best way for you to be a proper wife.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I know that you are a teacher among the Lord&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No, I am not a teacher. I am a minister. The difference between a teacher and a minister is that a teacher instructs you how to do things, such as how to be a good wife, but a minister ministers Christ into others.&rdquo; The sister said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, please minister something to me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Sister, this is much better. If you ask me to teach you how to be a good wife, I don&rsquo;t have a heart for this. But if you ask me to minister something of Christ, this is right. However, although I can minister Christ to you, you have to enjoy Christ yourself. I can serve breakfast to you, but I cannot eat breakfast for you. No one can eat for anyone else. A mother cannot eat for her children. Even a babe has to drink milk for himself.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;Sister, Christ is now within you as your life. Learn to contact Christ in your spirit, not by your mind. Learn to call yourself back into your spirit day by day and moment by moment. Come back to your spirit to meet Christ there. Learn how to exercise your spirit to contact Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sister then asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, when I contact Christ in such a way, what should I say?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Sister, there is no need for you to prepare anything to say. Every moment simply call your whole being back into your spirit. Just contact the Lord and meet Him there. Simply tell Him how you feel. You can tell Him, &lsquo;Lord, I need to be a good wife, but I feel I am too weak to be a good wife. Lord, I want to be patient, but I have no patience. I cannot do this.&rsquo; Just speak something to the Lord. Tell Him everything that you feel and what burdens you. Besides this there is nothing you need to do. What happens next is not my business. That is the Lord&rsquo;s business. I am not your prophet. I am simply ministering Christ to you, instructing you how to contact Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few days this sister came to a meeting. When she saw me, she smiled brightly and said, &ldquo;Oh, Brother Lee, it is wonderful! Let me tell you what happened.&rdquo; During the meeting there was a time for fellowship and testimonies. She stood up and gave a very living testimony, telling the saints how much the Lord meant to her after she contacted Him. She had found the secret.</p>
<p>The way is not to learn many doctrines, to listen to many teachings, or even to read much from the Scriptures merely by our mentality. All of this does not work. We have to realize that now the Lord is the Spirit. He is life to us, and now He is within us as the Spirit. Our need is to contact Him in our spirit day by day and moment by moment. We should always keep ourselves in contact with this living person, Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Why do we need to read the Bible? It is because the Scriptures are the means through which and by which we can contact Christ in our spirit. We must learn this very matter. Not only early in the morning but also all day long we have to continually stay in contact with the Lord. The more we stay in contact with the Lord, the more the Lord will occupy our whole being and the more the Lord will be our life supply. If we need wisdom, the Lord will be our wisdom. If we need strength, the Lord will be our strength. Whatever we need, such as light or love, the Lord will be to us.</p>
<p>The simplest way is to contact the Lord in our spirit. If we practice this, we will experience the Lord as everything. He will be our patience and our humility. If we allow Christ to live within us, we will be the most humble and patient people. All the items such as power, strength, patience, and love are nothing but Christ Himself. We should not try by our own efforts to be humble or patient, to love others or to be a good husband or wife. The only thing we must learn and experience is to keep in contact with Christ. If we do, Christ will be life to us and energize us to be a good husband or wife. Sometimes we are too clever, which makes us the most foolish persons. If we remain in contact with Christ, there is no need for us to be clever. Christ will be our wisdom, our life, our strength, our joy, our peace, and our comfort. Everything we need is in Him. If we contact Christ all the time, we will be wonderful, glorious persons in Christ, having Christ living within us. This is the simple yet proper way to be a Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>The issue of these experiences is that Christ is formed in us (Gal. 4:19). When we help children put on a glove, we have to help them to put their fingers into the glove gradually one by one. Then their hand will be properly formed in the glove. Christ is now within us, but He may be within us in an unformed way, like a hand inserted into a glove improperly. There may be no way for Christ to occupy our whole being, to expand Himself into all the inward parts of our being. However, if we stay in contact with Christ, day by day and moment by moment Christ will expand into all our inward parts and occupy us completely. Then Christ will be formed within us. We will have the mind of Christ, the emotion of Christ, and the will of Christ. Christ will become everything to us in our whole being. Christ will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). This means that we will be matured in the life of Christ.</p>
<p>Let us be very simple. Let us give up the way of knowledge and take the way of life. Here are two trees&mdash;the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. God&rsquo;s intention is that we partake of the tree of life, not the tree of knowledge. Regrettably, most Christians take the way of knowledge instead of the way of life. Therefore, today we have to change our way by being Christians. We must be Christians not in the way of knowledge but in the way of life. Forget about more knowledge and teachings. Simply stay in contact with Christ, the more the better. Then you will enjoy Christ and apply Christ in all of your daily living. You will experience Christ in a very practical way. I believe that this is the urgent need today for all Christians. Therefore, let us pray much. Pray and ask the Lord that His children would be helped to change their way of being a Christian. They must turn from knowledge to life. They need to give up the way of knowledge and simply take the way of life, to stay in contact with Christ all the time. He is life and everything to us. We should do nothing but take Him, enjoy Him, and apply Him day by day in a very practical way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST AS THE BREAD OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14, 12; 6:35, 56-57, 63; 10:10; 12:24; 14:16-20; 15:4-5</h1>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation present two similar pictures. If we look carefully into these two ends of the Scriptures, we will realize that both of them are related to the matter of God being life to man. The scene that is found in Genesis 2 reveals that after man was created, God put him before the tree of life. God&rsquo;s intention was that man would receive Him as life. Although man was created according to the image of God, which is Christ (Col. 1:15; 2 Cor. 4:4), man did not have the life of God. God put man before the tree of life with the intention that man would partake of this very tree and receive the life of God.</p>
<p>The eternal intention of God is to impart His very life into created man. However, before man partook of God&rsquo;s life, he was tempted by the enemy, Satan, to pay attention to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies something other than the tree of life. Only God Himself is the source of life. He is the unique fountain of life, the flow of life. However, in this universe there is another source, which is Satan, the enemy of God. Man was tempted by Satan to touch something other than God Himself. In this way, man committed sin, which brought in death. Eventually, four thousand years later Christ came and accomplished redemption. He redeemed man from sin, annulled death, and released His divine life in resurrection. Now as the Spirit He can be received by anyone who will believe into Him. Whoever believes into Him receives Him as life (John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>At the end of the Scriptures, the tree of life is still there, growing in the flow of living water to supply the glorious city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2). The ultimate picture in the Scriptures is the tree of life, growing in the flow of living water to be the food supply for all the redeemed ones. These two pictures, in Genesis and in Revelation, show us clearly that from the beginning God&rsquo;s intention and His ultimate goal have been that man take Him as his life. The Triune God is life to us. The Bible reveals clearly and simply that God in the Son and as the Spirit desires to impart Himself into us as life. By so doing, God mingles Himself with us. When we put tea into water, the tea mingles with the water. Then it is neither merely tea nor merely water; it is tea mingled with water, tea-water. We are a &ldquo;cup of water,&rdquo; and God is the &ldquo;tea.&rdquo; God put Himself into us to mingle with us, making us a God-man. We are a God-man because God is within us and even mingled with us. We have the boldness to tell people that we are not only a man but a God-man. No longer are we merely a cup of plain water; we are a cup of tea-water. We have the tea color, the tea taste, and the tea essence because we are mingled with the element of the tea. God Himself is now mingled with our spirit. How wonderful and marvelous it is that God in the Son and as the Spirit can be mingled with us! We not only have God but share in God Himself. The very Triune God, the Father in the Son and as the Spirit, is now indwelling us. This is a wonderful fact, and it is the revelation of the entire Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST, DIGESTING CHRIST,<br />
AND BEING MINGLED WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Between the two ends of the Bible, there is one book among the sixty-six which specifically deals with the matter of life. This is the Gospel of John, which is a book of life. The Gospel of John is usually referred to as a book of life. It tells us that in the beginning, in eternity, was the Word, and the Word was God (1:1). We all know that a word, simply speaking, is an expression. The words we speak are our expression. Since Christ is the Word of God and Christ is God, this indicates that Christ is the expression and explanation of God. One day this expression, the very Word of God, became a man by the name of Jesus. As a man, He dwelt among men not in a spectacular way but in a common way. Although He lived as a common carpenter, He was the very God dwelling among people (Mark 6:3). At that time no one understood much about Him. A number among people looked down on Him, yet some respected and honored Him very much. One day the crowds had the intention to make Him a king because they thought that He was so marvelous and wonderful. With just five barley loaves and two fish, He was able to perform a miracle to feed the five thousand (John 6:10, 14-15). However, He did not want to be a king, nor did He come to be a king. Instead, He told them that He was the bread of life (v. 35). He came not as a king but as the bread of life to be eaten by us. He came not to be honored by man but to be eaten by man. Even if we would honor Him as a king, He would not be happy. To render respect like this would not satisfy Him. Only one thing makes Him happy&mdash;that we take Him in and eat Him.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal intention is not to be worshipped in a religious way nor to be served by us, but to be eaten as food. He wants to enter into us, be digested by us, and become our very constituent. He desires to mingle Himself with us. This is His desire and intention. We have to take Him in as food and digest Him so that He might become our very constitution. Many of us may think that since our Lord is so glorious, great, and wonderful, we should enthrone Him in the heavens. Our concept is to prostrate ourselves in worship before Him. However, the Lord can never be happy with this. He may say to us, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep Me in heaven. I wish to dwell in your heart. I wish to be received by you, digested by you, and wrought into your very being. I want to be mingled with you to such an extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once as I spoke with a group of Christians, I asked a sister, &ldquo;Will you tell me how the Lord is a help to you?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Since the Lord is in the heavens as the almighty One, when I pray, He answers me. He simply stretches out His strong arm and mighty hand to do something for me. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful?&rdquo; But I shook my head and said, &ldquo;Sister, this is not the way the Lord works today in the New Testament age. Today the Lord&rsquo;s way is to come into us and dwell within us. He is not in the heavens stretching out His mighty arm to help you; He is now within you.&rdquo; There are many people who think that the Lord is in the heavens stretching out His arms to help them in this way. On the contrary, the way the Lord takes today is to enter into man, dwell within him, and energize him from within. His working within us strengthens and energizes us, making us strong, active, and full of vitality so that we can never be idle and never be quiet. The way the Lord takes today to strengthen us is not from the outside but from within. As I am speaking for the Lord, He helps me and strengthens me but not from the heavens outwardly. He energizes me from within, because His indwelling, working, and strengthening are from my spirit. He works within us because He is life, even the bread of life, to us. This is wonderful!</p>
<p>In Matthew 15 a woman came to the Lord crying out, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!&rdquo; The Lord, however, did not answer her. Eventually the Lord told her that He was a small piece of bread on the table (vv. 22-27). That woman called Him the Lord and the Son of David. This is not wrong. He is both the Son of David and the Lord, yet as the Son of David and the Lord Himself, He comes as bread to the children to be eaten by them.</p>
<p>We need the realization that the Lord Jesus Christ is food to us. The best way to experience the Lord is to take Him in as our food. I am not saying that we should not worship the Lord or serve Him, but the best way to deal with the Lord and make Him the happiest is to take Him as food. We must learn to take the Lord as our life, enjoying Him, applying Him, and appropriating Him daily. No doubt, He is the Lord and the almighty God, yet He is also food to us. The very God in His Son as the Spirit is food for us to take, to digest, and to mingle with our being. At this point God becomes subjective to us, saturating our entire being. This is His eternal purpose and ultimate intention. Nothing is more important or necessary than this. Before, we may have had the thought that the best way to contact the Lord was to worship Him, serve Him, and do something good to please Him. Now we see that we need to take Him as food, enjoy Him as our life within, and apply Him moment by moment in everything in our daily living. May we all be deeply impressed that this is the best way to contact God and make Him happy. As we enjoy Him, we can apply Him as everything.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST PROCESSED<br />
THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION AND<br />
BECOMING THE SPIRIT TO ABIDE IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>In John&rsquo;s Gospel the Lord went on to tell us how He could give Himself to us. The Lord gave Himself for us by dying on the cross and shedding His blood. By shedding His blood, He redeemed us from our sins, cleansed us from all defilement, and made us clean and pure. Now as clean vessels, we can receive Him into us. On one hand, His death on the cross redeemed us, cleansing us from our sins to make us pure and clean. On the other hand, His death on the cross released the divine life from within Him just as a grain of wheat falls into the ground, dies, and grows up to produce many grains (12:24). The very life within the original grain was released into many grains. Through death and resurrection the Lord released Himself into His many believers. He was once the unique grain of wheat, but through His death He released His divine life and produced us in His resurrection to make us the many grains. As He was the one grain of wheat with the life element, so we are the many grains, possessing the same life. Through the processes of His death and resurrection, we have been made the same as He.</p>
<p>Not only so, He told the disciples that He would not leave them as orphans but that He would come back to them (14:18). While in the form of the flesh He would leave them, but He would return in another form as the Spirit. His intention when He left the disciples was to die in the form of the flesh. After His death in the flesh, He would be resurrected from the dead and come back to them not in the flesh but as the Spirit. As the Spirit He can enter into us and be one with us. Now that the Lord is the Spirit, He can dwell within us. In John 14:20 the Lord told them, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; <em>That day</em> refers to the day of resurrection. In resurrection the disciples would realize that He is in the Father, the disciples are in Him, and He is in them. Christ is in the Father, we are in Christ, and Christ is in us. Through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, He became the Spirit. Today this very Spirit is within us. He is both the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God. That the Holy Spirit is now indwelling us means that Christ and God are also within us. This indicates that all three of the Triune God are within us.</p>
<p>We need to forget our natural thoughts about God. There are many concepts remaining within us concerning our relationship with God. Some have the consideration that they should behave themselves in a proper way in order to please God and that they should sacrifice themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s work. Others have aspirations to go to faraway places to preach the gospel. Still others consider how to worship the Lord and how to do their best to serve the Lord for their entire life. This is what is in our heart, and these are matters which are always on our mind. Whether this is right or wrong is hard to say, but we should forget all these things. The one thing we need to realize is that today the Triune God in Christ and as the Spirit is indwelling us to be our food, our life, our life supply, and our everything. When we go to the Lord, we need to praise Him and thank Him that He is in us as our life, our food, our drink, our strength, and our everything. All we need to do is realize Him, enjoy Him, apply Him, and experience Him. We should have no intention to do this or that for Him but should simply learn how to enjoy Him and apply Him. Praise the Lord, we only care to enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN CHRIST FOR FRUIT-BEARING<br />
AS THE OVERFLOW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>At this point some may ask what will happen next. We should not be concerned. Please remember that we are all branches of the vine (15:1-5). As such, we should not consider ourselves to be so small and pitiful that we only have the thought of worshipping the vine or sacrificing ourselves to do something for the vine. No branch would serve the vine or bow down to worship the vine in this way. If it did, the vine might say, &ldquo;Little branch, don&rsquo;t be foolish. Simply realize that you are a branch and I am the vine. Abide in me and allow me to abide in you. There is nothing left for you to do.&rdquo; When we abide in the vine, all that He has and is will be a life supply to us, energizing us to bear fruit. This is not to toil or do something but to bear fruit. Fruit-bearing is simply the overflow of the life of the vine through the branches. It is the overflow of Christ through us as His many branches. He is the vine full of life and life supply, and we are branches of this vine. Nothing else matters other than abiding in Christ and letting Christ abide in us. Then all that He is and all that He has will be our portion. We will enjoy Him, apply Him, and absorb Him. This is the way of life, and this is the way to deal with the Lord. It is not the way of knowledge or of doing things for Him. We should forget those things and remember only that He is the unique vine in the entire universe. He is the vine tree, and we are branches in Him. We need a full realization of this wonderful, glorious, divine, eternal, and spiritual fact. Abide in Him and let Him abide in you. That is good enough. Then He will be everything to you. He will be your life, your supply, and your everything.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will bear fruit without intending to do so. Branches bear fruit spontaneously without any labor because the fruit springs out of the life. We do not need to try to be humble, good, and patient. If we simply abide in Christ, all the human virtues, such as humility, patience, love, and goodness, will be manifested effortlessly. Although people may praise us for being humble, we will not be aware of our humility. If we try to be humble, we may be proud of our success and criticize others for not being humble and patient. This is an ugly humility and an ugly patience. This is not Christ. Fruit as the overflow of Christ flows out of us spontaneously without our consciousness or intention through our constant abiding in Christ. The way of abiding in Christ and letting Christ abide in us, not the way of knowledge or of working, is the way of life, which we as Christians must take.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECRET OF ABIDING IN HIM</h2>
<p>In order to put this matter into practice, we need to know the secret of maintaining our abiding in Him and His abiding in us. First of all, we need to have the revelation that we are in Christ. I would even suggest that we place these two words <em>in Christ</em> in a frame and hang it on our wall. We are now in Christ, but do we have the full realization that we are in Him? If we have the intention to abide in Christ, the first thing we need to see is that we are already in Him. If you ask me where I am right now, I will tell you that I am in Christ. I am not merely in Seattle or Sacramento or San Francisco; I am a person in Christ. As we are branches of Christ, we are one with Christ. In this universe there is such a vine, and each of us is one of His branches. If we see this, we will be beside ourselves. We will be &ldquo;crazy,&rdquo; telling everyone that we are in Christ. It is not a small matter to be in Christ. One day I do believe and expect that many of us will see the revelation that we are in Christ. When we see this, we will be so joyous. We may feel that even the universe is too small for us. We will be so excited that we will run to tell others. It is a glorious thing to be in Christ.</p>
<p>If we maintain our standing and position in Christ, we will enjoy the constant flowing of the life of Christ within us. We will continually remain in fellowship with Christ, who is within us. We will always have His presence and smiling face. Then, whenever we discover a problem between us and Christ, we should go to Him right away and open to Him, telling Him, &ldquo;Lord, there is a problem. What is the matter?&rdquo; Similarly, whenever we intend to do something, we have to speak to the Lord first concerning what we intend to do. If we are going to lose our temper, we need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am going to lose my temper.&rdquo; We need to speak to Him again and again, not once for all. Our speaking to Him is just like breathing. We do not breathe once for all. Even when we are sleeping, we are still breathing. Neither can we graduate from breathing. We may graduate from a school after four years of study, but we cannot graduate from eating, drinking, and breathing. If we &ldquo;graduate,&rdquo; we will die. We cannot graduate from life; we must continue in life matters all day long. As long as a light switch is on, we have light. Whenever it is off, there is darkness. We may have the idea that the Lord wants to give us a big &ldquo;battery&rdquo; so that one empowering from Him will last us for at least three years. The Lord will never give us such a battery. He desires to be like a current of electricity that is transmitted into us time and time again. We have to switch on and always keep ourselves in contact with Him so that we may enjoy Him. Whenever we realize that there is insulation between us and the Lord, we have to go to Him and ask Him what it is.</p>
<p>The secret to being a living Christian is not merely to listen to messages, learn doctrines, or gain knowledge in letters. The secret is to practice staying in contact with Christ continuously. He is the vine, and we are one of the branches. We need to practice abiding in Him and always maintain the sense of life within. We can make sure that a current of life is flowing within us all the time by keeping a sweet fellowship between us and Him. We will learn to sense His presence within. Then, whatever we do, whatever we speak, and wherever we go, we will maintain His smiling presence by the flow of life within us. This is a proof that we are abiding in Him and He is abiding in us.</p>
<p>When we rise up every morning, there is no need to go to Him to pray for so many things, asking Him for help to do this and that. The first thing that we should take care of in the morning is to go to the Lord to be nourished by Him. Even to sustain our physical body, the first thing we should have every morning is a nourishing breakfast. In principle it is the same for our spiritual life. Each day in the morning we should speak to Christ, saying, &ldquo;Lord, now I come to You. You are my table. You are my feast, and You are my breakfast. I want to feed on You and drink of You. Praise You that You are my life, my food, and my daily supply.&rdquo; He will take care of everything that we need, for He knows what we need better than we do. Therefore, to ask Him to do this and that for us is not only wrong but foolish.</p>
<p>Many sisters are too worried about their husbands and their children. This occupies their prayer time very much, so that when they pray, they ask the Lord to take care of their husbands and children and to protect them from accidents. Other sisters pray earnestly about being a good mother and a good wife, asking the Lord for help and patience. The Lord surely knows how to take care of our husband and our children. We should just praise Him and look to Him. By eating Him, contacting Him, and enjoying Him, we will be filled with Him. He will fill us with joy, peace, energy, and His refreshing life. Then all day we will be persons full of Christ.</p>
<p>At noontime when you feel that you need lunch, go to the Lord again, saying, &ldquo;Lord, it is time for me to come to You again. I am coming to You to be fed.&rdquo; Look to the Lord, wait on Him, and take Him into you as your supply. You will be refreshed again and again. During the evening time you can go to Him yet a third time. You may say, &ldquo;Lord, now it is dinner time. This is the third meal of the day. I can still take something more of You into me as food.&rdquo; If we enjoy the Lord day by day in such a way, we will see what kind of powerful Christians we will be. We will accomplish many things without any self-effort. The issue will be the overflow of Christ. We will bear fruit again and again. This is the Christian life.</p>
<p>I hope that we will have a change in our way of being Christians. It is not the way of knowledge, teaching, doctrine, work, or toil but the way of life. We must give up all of the other ways and take the way of life, realizing that the Triune God is everything to us in Christ and as the Spirit. Then Christ will be our life and everything to us. This very Christ now indwells us, and we are in Him. We need to realize this glorious fact and take it by faith. Learn to always stay in contact with this living person, who is Christ Himself. Then we will surely grow up and bear fruit. May the Lord be gracious to us in such a way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TRANSFORMATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:29; Gal. 4:19; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor. 2:16b; Eph. 4:22-24; Rom. 8:6</h1>
<p>In the last two messages we saw that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to impart Himself into us as life in Christ through the Holy Spirit. The Scriptures tell us that we Christians are predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of His Son, Christ (Rom. 8:29). When we receive Christ as our Savior, we have Him as our very life; the Spirit brings Christ into our spirit to be life to us and regenerate us. Regeneration means that we receive another life&mdash;a life other than our natural life. Although we possess a natural life by our first birth, we receive another life, the divine life, by receiving Christ as Lord and Savior. This divine life is the very Christ Himself. Now we are mingled with God, and God is mingled with us. We are one with God; we are no more merely human beings but human beings mingled with God. God is within us as our life; the very Triune God in Christ as the Spirit is indwelling our spirit (v. 11). Now we and God are one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is a wonderful, divine mystery. The people of the world can never understand this. Their thought is that we Christians embrace a certain kind of religion. They do not realize that we have the very God Himself in Christ indwelling us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED INTO THE FORM OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We are all familiar with the word <em>regeneration.</em> We know that when we received Christ, we were regenerated; we were born again (John 3:3). Our second birth was not of the flesh but of the Spirit (v. 6). This birth did not originate from the life of our parents but from the life of God. Now as real Christians, who have been born again, we have two lives. We have the human life and the divine life. From our parents we have the life of Adam, while from God we have the life of Christ. Therefore, through regeneration we have a divine birth.</p>
<p>In this message, however, I want to present another word: <em>transformation.</em> Perhaps we do not have much appreciation of this term. However knowledgeable most Christians are of regeneration, <em>transformation</em> is a word which is not familiar to them. This word is used twice in the New Testament, referring to a metabolic change in a believer. It is used once in 2 Corinthians 3:18 where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into the image of Christ. The second time it appears is in Romans 12:2, where Paul charges the believers to be transformed by the renewing of their mind. The expression <em>transformed by renewing</em> is a lovely term. To be transformed is a very crucial matter that we need to experience after we have been regenerated. Although we are indeed regenerated persons, we need to realize that we are now in the process of being transformed.</p>
<p>Transformation involves a change from one form into another. It is to be shaped into a certain form through the addition of the divine substance. Therefore, we may say that we are being transformed into the form of Christ. Suppose a typical American, who possesses an American mind, emotion, will, temper, and habit, is regenerated. Now that he has been regenerated, he is no more merely an American; he is even the more a Christian. On the one hand he is an American, while on the other hand he is a Christian. However, at first he appears to be only a gentleman with an American form. God&rsquo;s intention is to transform him from an American form to the form of Christ. It is the same with a Chinese gentleman. Although he may be Cantonese by nature, suppose this person also becomes a Christian. Born with a Cantonese mind and exhibiting a Cantonese temper and habit, he is totally Cantonese, yet he is now a regenerated Christian. He, too, must be transformed, not from the Cantonese form into the American form but from the Cantonese form into the form of Christ. No matter how different we are, we have all been regenerated by the same Christ and with the same life. However different in form, we all need to be transformed from the natural and original form into one form&mdash;Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Although we have the life of Christ, it is doubtful that we have the form of Christ. If we are asked whether or not we have the life of Christ, we will surely answer yes. But our thinking, temper, and habits may be natural and not bear the expression of Christ. Our way of living may be ten percent Christ and ninety percent Cantonese. We need to ask ourselves whether or not we have the form of Christ. Praise the Lord, we do have the life of Christ! But if you ask me how much of the form of Christ I have, I may answer that I am only partly in His image. An amount of the Chinese form may still remain with me. Therefore, there is much need of transformation. To be regenerated is solely a beginning; it is the start of our Christian life. There is a process after regeneration called transformation. We have been regenerated, and now we are in the process of transformation. Ultimately we will be brought into glorification.</p>
<p>Although we have been regenerated with the life of Christ, we may not have that much of the form of Christ. We have the life of Christ, but we are not like Christ in the way we think, in the way we love things, in the manner in which we choose things, and in the way we conduct ourselves. Many of us are still mostly American or Chinese in form. We do not manifest the form of Christ but another form. I have met a good number of real believers in Japan, for example, and I stayed with them for a number of days. However, when I was with these lovely brothers all the time, I had the registration that they were more Japanese than Christian. I realized that although they had the life of Christ and were regenerated, they were short of transformation. They were very good and nice but very lacking in the form of Christ, that is, in the reality of Christ within, which is expressed outwardly.</p><h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</h2>
<p>The practical way for us to be transformed is by being renewed in our mind (Rom. 12:2). Transformation takes place by the renewing of the mind. The mind is of major importance. Our whole being is under the influence of our mind. Whatever we do and however we behave is very much related to our mind. The mind takes the lead to direct at least ninety percent of the activities of our entire being. Therefore, if we want to be transformed from the natural form into the form of Christ, we need to be renewed in our mind.</p>
<p>In 1946, the year after World War II ended, I went to Nanking, the old capital of China. I stayed there for a while to work for the Lord. While I was there, I was invited to dinner and introduced to a nice Christian gentleman. This man told me that he was very grateful to God, for he had the assurance that he was regenerated. He proceeded to tell me his thoughts about doing this thing and that thing for the Lord. His mind was very active in thinking about doing many things for the Lord. Although he sounded very good, I realized that this man had been regenerated in his spirit but not renewed in his mind. He still possessed a natural mind.</p>
<p>Our mind must be renewed in many respects, and the first thing that needs to be renewed is the thought that we can do something for God. If we desire to be transformed, our mind needs to be adjusted in this particular matter. We should not think that we can do something for the Lord. Rather, we need to receive something of God into us and enjoy Him. When that gentleman was talking with me about his thoughts to do this and that for the Lord, I said in my heart, &ldquo;No, you need to change your mind. You must realize that your need today is to receive God and enjoy God. Stop thinking so much about doing things to please God. You must give up this thought of doing things and realize the fact that you need to take in something of God to be filled with Him. Your need is to be fed with God and satisfied with Him.&rdquo; If we intend to be transformed and be normal Christians, the first thing that needs to be changed is the thought that we are able to do things for God. We need a renewed mind in order to realize that we should take God into us as life. As a rule, most of us have the thought that since the Lord is so good to us, we can express our gratefulness by doing something for Him. This is a natural thought which we have spontaneously. Whenever we have such a thought, we have to realize that there is the need of the renewing of our mind. May we abandon the thought of doing something for the Lord and realize the fact that we need to receive something of Him.</p>
<p>Some may still ask what they should do for the Lord. If we receive the Lord into us and enjoy Him, something will spontaneously issue forth from our enjoyment of Him. Our real need is to be filled with Christ and be satisfied with Him. Therefore, if we want to know the Lord in the way of life and not in a natural way, we need to have our mind renewed from the thought of doing things for Him. When our mind is renewed in this way, we will be clear that we need to enjoy the Lord and be filled and satisfied with Him day by day. We will desire to have not only more fellowship with the Lord but deeper fellowship with Him. Not only will there be a change in the way we think, but many things will be different; our way of choosing and deciding will also be renewed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENEWED BY DENYING THE SELF</h2>
<p>We are told in the Scriptures that we need to deny ourselves (Luke 9:23). In order to be transformed by renewing, we need to deny our self. More than ninety percent of our self is expressed through our mind; our mind is the expression of our self (Matt. 16:23-24). Hence, to deny our natural mind is to deny our self.</p>
<p>One day a brother came to me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I do not know how to deny my self. The Lord tells us to deny the self, but I simply do not know how to deny it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, to deny your natural mind and natural way of thinking is the real denial of your self. You need to hate your natural mind.&rdquo; Many times believers like to use the expressions <em>I think</em> or <em>I thought.</em> This is often the self expressed through the mind. Whenever we use the words <em>I think</em> or <em>I thought,</em> we need to tell ourselves that our natural mind has been crucified on the cross. It has been brought to an end by being put to death. We need to deny it. Our old man which has already been crucified with Christ is expressed almost exclusively through the mind. Therefore, we need to be renewed in our mind. If we want to be renewed in our mind, we need to deny the natural thoughts.</p>
<p>Recently another brother and I were traveling together. As we stayed together, we had differences in our way of thinking. He considered me merely as a northern Chinese, and I considered him merely as a Cantonese. Much trouble like this originates from our unrenewed mind. The more I thought about that brother in this way, the more ground I gave to the enemy. If I had gone along with my thoughts about him, I might have gone to his room and started quarreling. In order to avoid this, I needed to deny my natural mind, my thinking, and my self. I even needed to say, &ldquo;Satan, get away from me. I will not go along with you. I will not go along with my natural mind. I will walk according to the spirit. Christ is now indwelling my spirit. I will not follow my mind, but I will walk according to the spirit.&rdquo; Then I was able to go to the brother and say, &ldquo;Let us pray for the Lord&rsquo;s work and for the meeting tonight.&rdquo; I had a different attitude.</p><h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED TO HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>By listening to what Christians talk about when they come together, we can often tell that, whether American or Chinese, they do not bear the form of Christ. Although they are real Christians, they are not transformed. Their mind, their thinking, and their thoughts have not been renewed. We have been regenerated in our spirit, but we are still old in our mind. In our spirit we are brothers in Christ, but in our mind we remain American or Chinese. Thus, we need a renewed mind. We need to deny the natural mind. As a Christian I should have a Christian mind, not a Chinese mind or an American mind. Paul tells us that we have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16b), but do we have the boldness to say this? We can all say that we have the life of Christ, but can we all say that we have the mind of Christ? Sometimes we can, but most of the time we have another mind, such as the mind of a Cantonese. We need to be transformed by the renewing of our natural mind.</p>
<p>When we are genuinely filled with the Holy Spirit, our entire being is saturated with Christ, and our mind is totally occupied by Christ. Then our mind becomes the mind of Christ. There are two possibilities for our mind. Our mind can be set either on the flesh or on the spirit. If our mind is set on the flesh, it is a mind of the flesh. On the contrary, if we set our mind on the spirit, it is a mind of the spirit. The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6). We need to ask ourselves whether or not our own mind is set on the spirit. Even though we are Christians who love the Lord and seek after Him, where is our mind? We need to learn the lessons of denying our natural mind, yielding our mind to Christ, and handing over our mind to Him. We need to allow the Lord to occupy our mind and saturate it. If we let the Lord fill our mind, we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23), and we will have the mind of Christ.</p>
<p>At this point, the Spirit will saturate our mind. We will be filled with the Spirit to such an extent that even in our mind and thoughts there is the Spirit. Eventually this Spirit will extend His renewing work to reach our entire being&mdash;to renew our mind, our emotions, and our will. The Spirit will renew every part of our entire being. Then, we will be gradually transformed into the image of Christ. In whatever we think, choose, or decide to do, there will always be the sense, the registration, that Christ is expressed from within us. Others will sense Christ. Everyone will have the sensation that Christ is within us, because we manifest the form of Christ. Then we will not only have the life of Christ and the mind of Christ, but even more we will have the form of Christ. Although others may think we are Cantonese or Americans, they will marvel at what kind of persons we are. The way we act, think, and make decisions is neither Cantonese nor American. Outwardly we may look American, but the way we think, act, and conduct ourselves is not American. What is expressed is the image of Christ, the form of Christ, because we have been transformed into His image.</p>
<p>In summary, now that we have been regenerated, we need to realize that we are in the process of being transformed from the natural man to a spiritual man. This transformation is being carried out by the renewing of our mind. When we deny our natural mind, the way we think, the way we decide, and the way we love, we will experience such a renewing. We should not concern ourselves with what will happen after our natural faculties are denied. Many things will happen, but they will be taken care of by the Lord. There is no need for us to take care of them. What we need to take care of on our part is to deny ourselves. Then the renewing process will take place. Following the renewing of our mind, our emotions and will also are renewed; that is, our entire being is renewed. We will become transformed persons, no longer natural but spiritual. Christ will occupy every part of our inward being. Gradually, our entire being will be saturated by Christ and filled with Christ. Ultimately, we will be transformed into the image of Christ and have victory over sin and the world. If we learn the lesson to be transformed day by day, it will be easy for us to overcome sins and the worldly things. There will be no difficulty for us to be sanctified in a practical way.</p>
<p>We all need to learn to be transformed, to be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and to deny ourselves. If we daily learn this lesson of denying ourselves practically and strictly, we will be occupied, filled, and saturated with the Lord. We will have the image of Christ. What an honor and glory this will be! We will have the life of Christ, the mind of Christ, the heart of Christ, the emotions of Christ, the will of Christ, and even the image of Christ. We will be fully like Christ. The people around us will be surprised to see that although we are typical Americans, we do not live by the American culture. We may be Chinese, but we do not behave like typical Chinese. We have been transformed into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>This is the factor of our oneness. This is the reason that we can be the church, His Body, the corporate expression of Christ. Naturally speaking, how could an American and a Cantonese person work together? It can happen only by their being transformed from the Cantonese form and the American form into the form of Christ to be one in Christ as the one Body, the expression of Christ. This is truly marvelous. What I have presented here is not a mere doctrine or teaching. These are some instructions affording us a definite way to proceed along the path of the Christian life. May the Lord be with us in this matter.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH AS THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:28-30; 12:24; 17:21-23</h1>
<p>John 3:28-30 says, &ldquo;You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him. He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; In these three verses there are two noteworthy words&mdash;<em>bride</em> and <em>increase.</em> John the Baptist told people not only that Christ is the Bridegroom who has the bride but that Christ must increase. What does it mean for Christ to increase? Christ must have an increase, and He must have His bride. If we read these verses carefully, we will realize that the bride is the increase of Christ. Simply by having a bride, Christ is increased.</p>
<p>Later on in the same Gospel, the apostle John tells us how Christ can have an increase. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; This word was spoken by the Lord Himself. The Lord Himself is the one grain of wheat who fell into the ground and died and grew up in resurrection to bear much fruit. The Chinese Union Version of the Holy Scriptures is a great help for understanding this portion. In some places in the Scriptures the Chinese translation is much better than many English versions. In the verse quoted above, the Chinese rendering is very accurate, saying, &ldquo;bears many grains.&rdquo; When one grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it springs up and bears many grains. I like the term <em>many grains.</em> Originally there was only one grain. However, after this grain is sown into the ground, it brings forth many grains. The many grains are the increase of that one grain. This is a picture of the increase of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST,<br />
THE INCREASE OF CHRIST,<br />
TYPIFIED BY EVE AS THE INCREASE OF ADAM</h2>
<p>As we have already seen in chapter 3, the Son of God must have the bride. This is a difficult thought to grasp. As Christians, we may have been reading the Scriptures for quite a long time, yet we still may not have a deep impression that the Son of God needs a bride. Since a bride is a wife, this indicates that the Son of God should have a wife, not in a natural sense but in a very holy and divine sense. What then does a wife signify in the Scriptures? There is a principle in the Scriptures that in order to properly understand a matter, we must look at the first mention of it. Therefore, to know the scriptural meaning of a wife and marriage, we need to go to the record of the first wife.</p>
<p>The first wife recorded in the Scriptures is Eve, the wife of Adam (Gen. 2:23-24). The wife of Adam is the increase of Adam. When God created man, He did not create two persons; He created only one man, by the name of Adam. Adam was a bachelor. However, God said that it was not good for man to be a bachelor, to be single (v. 18). God arranged for Adam to have an increase. Eve did not come into being separate from Adam or originate outside of Adam. Eve was made from a part of Adam to be the increase of Adam. According to the record in Genesis 2, God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, opened up his side, and took out a rib (v. 21). God then made this rib into a wife for Adam. God used a little rib from Adam to produce a wife for Adam and then brought Eve back to Adam. In this way, Eve became a counterpart of Adam, Adam&rsquo;s increase.</p>
<p>Paul tells us in Ephesians 5 that the account of Adam and Eve is a type of Christ and the church (vv. 31-32). For the purpose of illustration we may say that before He died, Christ was &ldquo;single.&rdquo; One day God put Christ to sleep on the cross. According to the Scriptures to sleep simply means to die (John 11:13; Matt. 27:52). When God caused Christ to die on the cross, one of the soldiers pierced His side, and blood and water flowed out (John 19:34). Whereas the blood is for redemption, the water symbolizes the life of Christ that became the life of all the believers who compose the bride of Christ, the church. The church, then, as the counterpart of Christ comes out of Christ. The church is the increase of Christ just as Eve was the increase of Adam.</p>
<p>For Christ to remain a &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; is not according to the Scriptures. Without a wife we are single, but with a wife we are increased. In the same way, without the church Christ is &ldquo;single&rdquo;; He is only one grain. He needs an increase. The increase of Christ is the church. Christ as the one grain became many grains, yet the many grains are not individual grains. The many grains need to become one loaf, one bread (1 Cor. 10:17). The many grains are the members of this one Body, this one bread. In John 3 we are told that Christ must increase. The way that Christ can have an increase is in John 12, where Christ is the unique grain of wheat who died and rose to produce many grains to be His increase.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS BEING BUILT INTO ONE</h2>
<p>The way for the many grains to become one Body, one bread, is found in John 17, where the Lord prayed that all the believers would be one. Verses 21 through 23 say, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believers are not merely individuals. Although we may appear to be complete persons, we are not individuals but members. To be a member is different from being an individual. An individual person is a complete unit, but a member is not complete. We may have thought that as far as being a Christian is concerned, it is all right to do everything by ourselves. We can sing hymns, we can pray, we can read the Scriptures, and we can preach the gospel independently of others. We can even help people and wage war with the enemy by ourselves. We think we can do everything because we consider that in ourselves we are complete Christians. Even though we do not declare this openly, we may have this thought deep within. One day the Lord will open our eyes and cause us to realize that we are nothing but members; we are not complete units.</p>
<p>As humans, we are individuals, complete units, but as Christians, we are not complete units but members. Without the brothers and sisters we cannot live, we cannot move, and we cannot do anything. We are merely members. Our hand is a member of our body. Without the body how could our hand be living and active to do many things? We should not regard ourselves as individual grains but as one loaf, one Body. The many grains have to be mingled together and blended into one loaf. None of us as Christians, reborn ones, are complete in ourselves. We can never be complete in ourselves because every one of us is a member of the Body. Hence, if we realize this, we will feel the need to be one with all the members of the Body. We will realize that without the Body we cannot live and do things.</p>
<p>We may have read the Gospel of John, but we may not have seen the important things revealed in this book. We have seen that the Lord came to give us life. But we may not have seen that we have the divine life in order that Christ may have an increase or that those who possess the Lord&rsquo;s life become His one Body as a bride to the Bridegroom. All of those who believe in the Lord and who have received the same divine life should be one. As Christians, we are not complete units; we are all members. We should have such a deep sense that we can never be complete in ourselves. Because we are members of the Body, we truly need the Body. The Body is our perfection. Without the Body, we are neither perfect nor complete.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE BODY IN PRACTICALITY<br />
AS OUR COMPLETION</h2>
<p>We may say that we need the Body, but do we have the Body in practicality? We may say that we are in the Body, but are we in the Body in doctrine or in reality? If you tell me that you are in the Body in reality, I will check with you further. If you look at my arm and hand, you can easily perceive that they are members of my body in reality. If you ask my hand to whom it is joined, it will say it is joined to my arm, and if you ask my arm, it will say it is joined to the shoulder. In many places where I visit, the believers say that they are in the Body in reality, but when I ask them to whom they are joined, they tell me that they are joined to the Head, Christ. According to their understanding, they are like a hand which is directly joined to the head. To them it seems that all the members of the body should be attached directly to the head. This is awful; it is a monster rather than a body. However, this is the real situation today among believers. Many Christians claim that they belong to the Head and are joined to Christ, but we need to realize that we are only one of many members comprising the Body. We need to maintain a proper relationship with the members of this Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
BEING NOT IN OUTWARD PRACTICES<br />
BUT IN THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 17:21-23, we can be one only when we are in the Triune God. Verse 21 says, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me.&rdquo; To be in &ldquo;Us&rdquo; in this verse is to be in the Triune God, that is, in the Son and in the Father. We can be one only in Christ, not in anything else. Praise the Lord that we are in Christ! As long as we are in Christ, we are one. Regrettably, however, Christians make many other things their center. Some believers make the practice of baptism by immersion the center of their oneness, and based on this they set up a Baptist Church. Other Christian groups consider the presbytery the best system of church administration. They are one in the presbytery, so they establish a Presbyterian Church. Still another group calls themselves Methodists based upon the teachings of John Wesley. They also form their own church and hold as their center and focus the best methods by which to live a holy life. Therefore, Christians are divided over the practice of baptism, the systems of church government, and the methods of holiness. Although I would say that baptism is right and the presbytery is also right, I dare not say that all methods of holiness are right; they need to be checked against the Scriptures. However, we need to remember that we are one in Christ alone, not in these foregoing matters. May we all abandon our insistence on matters such as baptism, the presbytery, and methods of holiness and not make them our centers. We are one in Christ alone.</p>
<p>Regardless of our views on the above practices, we need to realize that we are the saved ones, the regenerated ones. We are those who believe in the Son of God and who have received Him as our life. Thus, we are all one in Christ Himself. Because the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Father, and we believers are in Christ, we can be one even as They are one. How wonderful this is!</p>
<p>In verse 22 of John 17 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&rdquo; The glory mentioned here, simply speaking, is the expression of the divine life. The Son has the divine life of the Father because the Father has given this life to the Son. Now that the Son in turn has given this life to us, we also have the life of the Son, which is the very life of the Father. Just as the Son and the Father are one in the divine life, we are one in the Son because we possess the same life. Since you have the life of Christ, I have the life of Christ, and others have the life of Christ, we are all one in this same life. Whether or not we believe in baptism by immersion or the presbytery, every one of us has the same life of Christ. Whether you call yourself a Baptist, a Presbyterian, a Methodist, an Anglican, or a Congregationalist, regardless of all of these differences, we are one in that we all have the life of Christ. It is the life of Christ that makes us one. We should all be one because we have the same divine life.</p>
<p>John 17:23 says, &ldquo;I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&rdquo; Here the Lord says that He, the Son of God, is in the believers, and the Father is in Him that the believers may be perfected into one. How glorious this is! It is not only that we are in Christ, but that Christ is in us. Because we have received Christ as our life and are filled with Christ, we are one in Christ. This is the factor that enables us to be one. Are we willing to give up all the things that divide the Body of Christ? Can we say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not want to focus on anything else. I have Your life, I am in You, and You are in Me. Therefore, I am one with all the dear ones who have the same life that I do.&rdquo; This is sufficient. As long as we are in Christ and we have Christ in us as our life, we are all members of His one Body. We need to have such a realization of the oneness of the Lord&rsquo;s Body. This is what the Lord prayed for in John 17.</p><h2 class="head1">REALIZING THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>John 3:29-30 tells us that the Lord must have a bride as His increase, His Body, the church. Christ&rsquo;s increase comes into being because Christ died, rose, and imparted His life into us to make us His counterpart. Christ is the unique grain of wheat, and we are now the many grains as His increase. Now the many grains need to be blended together as one loaf. We can have this oneness only by taking Christ as our life and allowing Christ to live in us. We are in Christ, Christ is in us, and we have Christ as our life; therefore, we are one. If we would simply realize this, we would be powerful Christians. There will be a real impact among us. We are one Body as the bride of Christ, His increase, His expression, just as Eve was a bride to Adam. Regrettably, this truth has been greatly damaged by the enemy. He has divided and dismembered the Body of Christ so that the one unique church as the Body of Christ has become many so-called churches in division. We need to realize the oneness of the Body.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we as individuals are not the bride. It is the corporate Body which is the bride, and we are merely parts, members, of this one Body, the bride. In order to realize the reality of this bride, we need to be in the reality of the Body. A proper and normal Christian is one who realizes that he is a member, not an individual. If we realize we are the members of the Body, we will function as members. If we do not function as members, this means we do not realize the Body.</p>
<p>Are we living for Christ, or are we living for ourselves? If we are living for ourselves or for something else, it is difficult to realize the reality of the Body of Christ. In order to have the reality of the Body of Christ, we must live for Christ. Even at home and in our daily life, our living needs to be unto Him. Our eating, our drinking, and even how we care for our children should all be unto Christ. Everything we do and accomplish needs to be unto Christ, because we have consecrated ourselves with all of our living to Him. Whether we are in the meetings or at home with our family, we are living unto Christ. Then whatever happens to us, whether positive or negative, is all unto Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING OUR RESPONSIBILITY<br />
TO PRACTICE THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>Concerning our attitude toward the believers who remain in the divisions, we cannot bear responsibility for the actions of others, but we should be responsible for our own attitude. Christianity today is vast, and the number of Christians is very great. Even within the Catholic Church I have met a good number of real believers. We should not have the attitude that there are no real ones in Christendom or that they are hopeless cases. Among them there are still many genuine believers; however, it is not easy for us to help them. Therefore, they are not our responsibility. We must bear our own responsibility before God.</p>
<p>Since we have been enlightened by the Lord concerning the oneness of the believers, we need to do our best to practice the oneness. If possible, we should endeavor to come together with the other real Christians. If they refuse to come together, it is beyond our control. If, for example, they choose to remain in the Catholic Church, it is impossible for us to join them. But if some are willing and open to meet together, we should welcome them as our brothers. If there is the possibility of joining with them and they are open to this, we need to take this opportunity. But if there is no possibility of this happening, it is out of our control, and we are not responsible for the result.</p>
<p>If we bear our own responsibility to keep the oneness, we will be the overcomers in a situation of confusion. Although the situation is one of confusion, we are walking according to the Lord&rsquo;s heart. The Lord is after the oneness of His believers. For centuries the Lord has been seeking after the genuine oneness. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have been enlightened. Accordingly, we should humble ourselves and pray, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me. I want to take some definite steps to join with as many believers as possible. If there is no possibility, Lord, that is not my business. It is out of my control. I can only come to You weeping, praying earnestly that You would have mercy on those dear ones and open their eyes that they may see the need of oneness. This is all that I can do. I would not insist on anything but that we all would be in Christ.&rdquo; This oneness is the very desire of God&rsquo;s heart.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR LIVING AND WORK<br />
HAVING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH IN VIEW</h2>
<p>Many saints came to Brother Watchman Nee and to me a number of times, inquiring why the Lord had given us so much light from the Scriptures. They confessed that they read the same Bible that we did, yet they were not able to receive light as we did. The answer is that if we go along with the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s Word will be opened to us; then we will have the light. The divine light, according to the typology of the Old Testament, is in the tabernacle (Exo. 25:31-40). If we are in the proper church life, we will realize the oneness, the building of God, and we will have the divine light. Then to be sure, the Bible will be opened to us. As we are practicing the church life and come to read His holy Word, we will be full of light; it will shine. Why are there so many Christians today who are spiritually blind? It is because they have given up the church life. They have forsaken the building of God&rsquo;s house, the church, and have established something by themselves and of themselves. This truly offends the Lord.</p>
<p>If we are seeking the Lord&rsquo;s mind and heart, we need to do our best by His grace to practice the oneness if at all possible. This will please the Lord very much and revolutionize our entire Christian life. We will be full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, blessing, authority, power, and strength. Even our gospel preaching will be powerful. The power and impact of our gospel preaching is related to the church life. The most powerful gospel preaching is the preaching of the church. When we as children of God practice the oneness of the Body and come together to serve the Lord, there will be an impact. Our gospel preaching as the church and through the church will bring thousands of people to the Lord. We have had this experience. As the church, it is easy to preach the gospel. A number of times when I talked with my missionary friends in the Far East, I said, &ldquo;Brothers, you have given up your homes, your relatives, your country, and everything to come here. You have sacrificed all of these for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake. We admire what you have done, but regrettably, when you began your work of gospel preaching, you did not preach the gospel with the church life and church ground in view. As a result you have lost your impact. If you had come here to be one with the church, you would have realized the impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first record of the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel was with the one hundred and twenty on the day of Pentecost. Acts 2:14 says that Peter stood up with the eleven, not by himself. Because the whole Body rose up to preach the gospel, there was the impact. In Taiwan today it is very easy to bring people to the Lord. Even now we have so many hundreds of baptized ones that we cannot adequately care for them. The church family has so many children that we are almost afraid to preach the gospel and gain more. This gospel preaching is being done not by a few individuals but by the church.</p>
<p>The church in Antioch sent out two workers in Acts 13, but their going out was in the Body. The Body was their support and backing. When Barnabas and Saul were sent out, the church laid hands on them. In this way the church was proclaiming that it was one with Barnabas and Saul. It is as if the church said, &ldquo;If you go, we go with you.&rdquo; They went out from the Body and with the Body. Not only so, their going out from the Body was to do the work of the Body, not the work of a sect. Therefore, if we intend to set up a meeting which is not open to all of the Lord&rsquo;s children, and we maintain certain regulations and conditions for fellowship and particular revelations that separate us from other believers, we are in division and in danger of becoming a sect.</p>
<p>Although there are already a great number of divisions and sects in existence today, they are the doings of others. On our part we should not set up another sect, and neither should we go along with any sect. We need to be open to all the children of God regardless of their background. We should go along with the believers, but we should not go along with a sect or organization. Our standing and ground is one of openness to all the Lord&rsquo;s children regardless of their particular backgrounds. As long as they are the Lord&rsquo;s children, we are open to receive them and ready to join together with them. It is not a small matter to maintain the standing that we receive all genuine believers and stand on the ground that includes all the Lord&rsquo;s children. Other believers may want to remain in their respective groups or organizations, but they bear the responsibility for this before the Lord. We have only one condition, regulation, and rule&mdash;we must be in Christ. Regardless of the minor matters such as whether or not they believe in speaking in tongues, baptism by immersion, or other matters, as long as they are believers in Christ, they are our brothers. We are ready to come together with them, and we are one hundred percent open to them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GUARDING AGAINST HERESY<br />
BUT RECEIVING THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>We need to be very careful in touching the matter of doctrinal error. We cannot tolerate error in the doctrine concerning the person and work of Christ. For example, some people today profess that they are Christians, yet they say that the Lord Jesus is not God. They claim that He was not born of the virgin Mary, that He did not die on the cross for our sins, and that He did not resurrect bodily. These are antichrists (1 John 2:22), today&rsquo;s modernists whom we cannot tolerate. However, there are some believers whose views are different from ours in doctrine or in practice. If some believe in baptism by sprinkling instead of by immersion, for example, we should be careful not to condemn this as an error in the category of heresy; rather, this is only a matter of different opinions. Although we do not insist on any doctrine or practice, we strongly defend the saving faith (Jude 3), the teachings concerning the person and work of Christ.</p>
<p>Receiving all real believers regardless of their doctrinal views and practices is presented in Romans 14 and 15. In these two chapters, the apostle Paul told us that although some believers insist on eating meat, some insist on eating herbs, others regard certain days, and still others do not regard them, we need to take a general attitude toward them all. Those believers who eat meat should not criticize those who do not and vice versa. If one believer regards a certain day, he should not criticize the one who does not. Because God has received every kind of believer, we have to receive them also. If we practice such a receiving of believers, the oneness among the Lord&rsquo;s children will be maintained.</p></body></html>
