   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this lesson we want to see the exercise of our spirit for godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of the verses in the Scripture reading are from 1 and 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Strictly speaking, the word exercise, in the sense of the exercise of our spirit for godliness, is used in the New Testament only in 1 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Timothy 4:7-8 says, "But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The exercise unto godliness is profitable for all the things of this present life and the coming life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament there are a number of seeming contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, of course, they are not contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that we should not have our own works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not do things in ourselves either to participate in God's blessing or to accomplish something for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But on the other hand, the New Testament uses a strong word such as exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Colossians Paul said that he labored, toiled, fought, and struggled in an agonizing way 1:29; 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These words are stronger words showing something which is very difficult to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to see these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our not doing anything means that we should not do anything by our flesh, by ourselves, or by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But on the positive side, we have to labor, to travail, and to struggle in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the exercise of our spirit comprises and implies all these words: labor, toil, struggle, wrestle, and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today whatever we do positively in our spirit is a kind of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word in Greek for exercise is the basis of the English word gymnastics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To participate in gymnastics, one must use all of his energy to exercise his whole physical being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must exercise our spirit in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The whole environment around us does not help us to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It has an intention to keep us down.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The whole situation does not help us to go on to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It helps us to be lazy; it helps us to be backsliding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a downhill current.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The downhill current helps us go down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the current carries you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if you go uphill, you have to exercise, and you have to struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this lesson, we have extracted the life essence from 1 and 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two books actually deal with godliness as the issue of the divine dispensing for the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this lesson, I did my best to pick up all the necessary verses to show us the life of godliness.</S>
