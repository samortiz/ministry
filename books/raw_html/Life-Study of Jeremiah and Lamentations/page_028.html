<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWO EVILS OF ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 2:1&#151;3:5</H1><P>In 2:13 Jehovah says of His people, "My people have committed two evils: / They have forsaken Me, / The fountain of living waters, / To hew out for themselves cisterns, / Broken cisterns, / Which hold no water." In this message on Israel's sin against Jehovah and Jehovah's punishment of Israel, we will consider these two evils of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. FORSAKING JEHOVAH,<br>THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS</H2><P>The first evil of Israel was to forsake Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah God Considering Himself a Husband<br>to His Beloved Elect, Israel</H2><P>In the book of Jeremiah, Jehovah God considers Himself a husband to His beloved elect, Israel, and Israel a wife to Him. Jeremiah 2:1&#151;3:5 may thus be regarded as a conversation between a husband and wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Remembering<br>the Love of Israel's Bridal Days</H2><P>"Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: / I remember concerning you the kindness of your youth, / The love of your bridal days, / When you followed after Me in the wilderness, / In a land that was not sown" (2:2). There was a bridal day, a wedding day, for Jehovah and Israel, and Jehovah, the Husband, still remembered that day of love.</P>
