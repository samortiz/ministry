   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUMMIT OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But receiving the forgiveness of sins merely recovers us back to the state before Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was just a man, and his life was merely a human life at the proper level.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But God intends to give His only begotten Son to us so that we may receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the summit of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is not only recovering what we lost in Adam; He is bestowing what Adam never received.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Adam did not eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Had he not sinned at all, he would still be merely human.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had no relationship with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we have inherited something far more excellent in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition to a human life, we have a new life, a life from God, which is the very Son of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the meaning of eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It simply means a life of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man's life is transient; it will not survive in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the life of the Son of God can exist there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I put my own life in eternity, it would shrivel up immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would not last!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would perish as a fish in air or a bird in water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's life can only carry him through a temporary existence on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It will not make it through eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only an eternal life can survive in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First John 5:11-12 says, "And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we are told that this life of eternity is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is found in no other place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whoever does not have this life in the Son is merely a human; he can only exist on earth, but not survive in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He does not have that life which qualifies him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the Son of God passed through death and resurrection and became the Holy Spirit, He is no longer limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can now receive Him anytime and anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hitherto, whoever received the Son of God received God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, whoever receives the Holy Spirit receives the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This enables all those who have received Christ to obtain a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only are their sins forgiven, but they inherit an eternal life from God as well.</S>
