   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Letting Sin Enter into Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through man's fall, man let sin enter into him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 5:12a says that through one man sin entered into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually the world here means mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When sin entered into man, that really meant that Satan entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>E. Making Man the Victim of Death</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The real significance of man's fall is that Satan was taken into man, sin entered into man, and man became a victim of death Rom 5:12b, 14a; 1 Cor 15:22a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 5:12b points out that through sin entering into the world, death passed on to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Death is the ultimate result of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 5:14a says that from Adam to Moses, death reigned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Death even became a king.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 15:22a says that in Adam all die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, all of mankind is a victim of death through man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this lesson we have to stress how man became one with Satan in his three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every part of man was ruined, corrupted, and deadened, making man a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin entered into man, moving, damaging, and killing man, and man is now altogether under the tyranny of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man is a victim of death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not just man transgressing against God, not just man falling under God's condemnation, but man receiving Satan into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan's being entered into man's being, and Satan himself as sin entered into man's body, making man's body the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through all this, man's spirit was also deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must make all these points so clear and so impressive to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we can go on to help the saints to see the need of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is not just the need of an objective salvation, but the need of a subjective life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lesson four and this lesson are crucial so that we can have the proper experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must do a good work to make all the saints clear about how Satan spoiled man and how man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not just a matter of man transgressing against God and falling under God's condemnation, but a matter of man taking in something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may use the illustration of a mother warning her child not to take in something poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the mother's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the mother leaves home and the child takes in that poison, this is not merely a transgression against the mother's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a receiving of the poison into the child's being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is an illustration of what happened when man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God comes in to save us, He does not just take care of our transgression and of our being under His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He also works to take away the poison and to rescue us from death.</S>
