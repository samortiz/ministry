   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A nation is not built upon a school or a club; its foundation is the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the homes a nation cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the same way, if the church is to prosper today, the homes need to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the homes in the church are strong, the church will have a good prospect and a bright future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the new way revealed to us in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today in mainland China, Satan hates the churches that meet in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These churches comprise more than fifty million believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The authorities condemn the shouters, who are predominantly those who meet in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some saints have written telling us how strong and revived these home meetings in mainland China are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have no apparent leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whoever tries to be the leader is asking for trouble because the authorities focus their attention on the leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when everyone is a leader, the authorities can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is one reason that we are practicing to have no heads among us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, everyone should be a speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever assumes the headship is asking for trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must learn from the brothers and sisters in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have no pastors or preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone preaches, and the more they preach, the stronger they become.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One preaches to ten, and ten preach to a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the gospel becomes more and more powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one could have believed that within a period of a dozen or so years more than fifty million Christians could be raised up in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is possible that in a few years the number could double to one hundred million.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One county alone has more than one million Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The leading ones have all been imprisoned, and no one wants to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet the saints are still very active and powerful in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of the imprisoned ones have been sentenced to terms of fifteen years, yet they still have small group meetings in their prison cells with some of the guards trying to join them in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is even more than what Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul brought the Philippian jailer to salvation, but he did not have meetings in his prison cell.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that the practice of everyone speaking is truly the way the Lord ordains and blesses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see that the real prospect and future of the church lies in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to evangelize Taiwan, the first thing we must do is build up the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once the home meetings are built up, Taiwan will be gospelized within one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if we still depend on our old ways, old organization, and old arrangements, and if we only depend on our past training, I am afraid that Taiwan will not be gospelized in fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that the co-workers and elders would change their view.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we see it, we will have the burden, and when we speak, our spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The most pressing need now is for all of us to promote this and to persuade others to do this in the various meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The saints will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It will not work if we try to push others to do this but are unwilling to do it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if we do it and urge the brothers and sisters to do the same, the result will be a success.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am concerned that the co-workers and elders may feel that they are merely following and obeying the training, merely doing what they have been told.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If this is the concept that we have of the practice of the new way, we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must have the inward light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our concepts must change.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our eyes must be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only then will we have the boldness to push the saints aggressively.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not asking that we busy ourselves with the arrangements of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am asking that we stir up the burden and stir up the saints until the saints fight to go to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a person is sick, he has no appetite for food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot force food down his throat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The best way is to stir up his appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once he becomes hungry, he will want food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope that the co-workers and elders can make every saint in the churches or the halls a glutton for souls; everyone will be starving to save some souls.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we can do this, the home meetings will be successful, and the evangelization of Taiwan will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not change our concept, and if we think that the new way is merely a change of method, from managing big meetings to managing small meetings, from managing small meetings to managing home meetings, and if we think that this can be accomplished easily by mere arrangements, we will find ourselves facing nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It would be better if we did not make any arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The minute we make arrangements, everything dies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we make arrangements for one home, we kill that home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we make arrangements for a second home, we stifle that home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then if we make arrangements for a third home, we bury that home.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The homes are like plants.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not move them, they live, but once we move them, they die.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we ourselves must first rise up, taking action in an aggressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then we will see others taking action who follow after us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When that happens, the new way will sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A tree is known by its fruit, and parents are known by their children.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are active in the new way, and if we are hungry for the home meetings, the ones who are saved through us will also be active and hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But if we are indifferent and unconcerned about the new way, the ones who are saved through us will also be loose and unconcerned.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we take this attitude, Taiwan will not be gospelized in one hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In a positive sense, all the co-workers and elders from now on must be hungry wolves, actively gaining people and caring for them.</S>
