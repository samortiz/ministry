[2]  After the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead, He manifested Himself to many people.
[3]  The Lord was eager to manifest Himself to Peter because Peter was in the midst of weakness, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene.
[4]  "Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb and beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
[5]  And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping?
[6]  She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
[7]  She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away."
[8]  Following this, "Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God."
[9]  Brothers and sisters, if you lack this revelation, if you have not seen the Lord and have not heard the word of the Lord, can you blame the Lord?
[10]  December is right in front of us, and many people will again celebrate Christmas.
[11]  According to the opinions of many believers, it is a good thing to have a day each year to remember the Savior's birth.
[12]  Only one who believes in the Bible will know that the things God did not command and the things God did command have the same significance.
[13]  May God give us more strength to enable us to say, "How do we dare do what God has not commanded?"
[14]  Can you find the difference between these two passages after reading them?
[15]  The Gospel of Matthew says that after the Lord's resurrection, an angel told the women to tell His disciples of His resurrection.
[16]  I told the Lord that I would die for Him, and the Lord said that before the cock crowed twice, I would deny Him three times.
[17]  It may be very easy for you not to love Him, draw near to Him, or return to Him; but it is impossible for Him to forget you, forsake you, or not love you.
[18]  Therefore, if you do not have the strength to come to the Lord, as long as you are willing to believe in His words, He will give you the strength to draw near to Him.
[19]  When you want to come close to the Lord, but feel that you are very far from Him and have no strength to come near to Him, you need to remember the words "and Peter."
[20]  Some have said that this refers to the coming of the Lord.
[21]  But this is not reliable for two reasons: 1 In the phrase "the Lord is near," the word "near" is not an adverb but an adjective; and 2 according to the original text, the word "near" occurs only four times in the New Testament.
[22]  Whether you are sitting, lying down, or walking, you can make everything known to God in three ways: 1 by prayer ordinary prayer, 2 by petition definite and specific prayer through prayer and petition you can tell God the requests in your heart , and 3 with thanksgiving thanking God for everything.
[23]  Is it enough to have prayer and petition alone?
[24]  No. The Bible mentions not only prayer and petition but also thanksgiving.
[25]  We must remember that everything that comes upon us has been placed in our hand by the nail-pierced hands; everything that comes upon us has been arranged by the Lord who died for us.
[26]  Therefore, we can thank God ahead of time, saying, "God, You can never be wrong."
[27]  Preaching is giving something of God to man, while prayer is acquiring something from God.
[28]  If you worry about your immediate problems, the break up of your family, the moral degradation of your children and their waywardness from the Lord, the failure of your business, the frictions between in-laws, the salvation of others, or the backward and fallen spiritual condition of God's children, your should realize that God wants you to cast your anxiety on Him.
[29]  But when you tell God what you want, in prayer and petition, on the one hand, and with thanksgiving, on the other, you will feel as if you do not even know how to be anxious anymore.
[30]  Most people in this world do not like to be misunderstood.
[31]  Sometimes good intentions can be misunderstood as bad intentions, or love can be misunderstood as hatred.
[32]  Brothers and sisters, our attitude toward God is just like this young man's. When we hear the name God, we do not like it and feel uneasy.
[33]  If you are willing to listen and if you hear what I say, you will know what kind of God He is.
[34]  He said, "Mr. Nee, I can be friends with you, but believing in Jesus is not a good thing to do." When I met him the second time I again asked him to believe in Jesus.
[35]  It is so wonderful that God is not only thinking about you, caring for you, paying attention to you, and being merciful to you, He also loves you.
[36]  But God not only is merciful toward you, He not only cares for you and pays attention to you, He also loves you.
[37]  I like the flowers and birds on that mountain.
[38]  I do not like to place birds in cages; I like to see them flying freely.
[39]  If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man.
[40]  If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.
[41]  During the European War World War I , a preacher led a young lady to repent.
[42]  Later she went to Paris and became a nurse for the Red Cross.
[43]  The preacher replied, "Maybe you can be happy in the world without Jesus, but the Lord Jesus in heaven cannot be happy without you."
[44]  God is not only merciful to us, He not only cares for us and is concerned about us, He loves us.
[45]  At the same time, God knows that you have sinned and that you still may sin even though the Lord Jesus died for you.
[46]  God gives us two great graces: one is to send the Lord Jesus to die for us so that our sins are forgiven; the other is to send the Holy Spirit to dwell in us so that we can have the strength not to sin.
[47]  John 5:40 says, "Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life."
[48]  It is not that God will not give life to you; it is that you are not willing to have life!
[49]  Therefore, while you are sitting here, if you have just a little desire to be saved, a tiny will to have eternal life, a tiny sensation to be released from sin, or a small wish to go to heaven, you will have it because God wants and wishes you would be this way.
[50]  Then if God was happy, He would open it; but if He was not happy, He would close it, and you would have to knock on the door from the outside.
[51]  Today I want to look at a wonderful story from the Old Testament about a lame boy sitting at a king's table.
[52]  In the Bible there are many wonderful stories: one tells us about a prostitute who was saved, one about a robber who was saved, one about a tax collector who was saved, and even one about a bad Pharisee who was saved.
[53]  "And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?" v. 1 . God is also asking, "Is there yet any that is left of Adam, that I may show him grace?" David showed Mephibosheth kindness for the sake of Jonathan; God graced the sinners because of His Son Jesus.
[54]  You may dream about how your future will be so beautiful and restful.
[55]  But after a while, you will find that the promises of the world are all unusable currencies.
[56]  Time after time, the world only brings you discouragement and disappointment.
[57]  "Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar" v. 5 . Fetch in the original text is "bring." Romans 3:11 says, "There is none who seeks out God." Luke 19:10 says, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost." Some people think that because we are so evil we should surely seek after God.
[58]  If God had to wait for us to seek Him before He saved us, we would probably never be saved because we would never seek after Him.
[59]  The Bible says God wants you, calls you, and sends men to tell you that He wants you.
[60]  He did not say, "Mephibosheth you are here"; he did not say, "Saul's grandson Mephibosheth"; he did not say, "Jonathan's son Mephibosheth"; he did not say, "Who are you?"
[61]  In the nineteenth century, there was a famous literary writer who was an antagonist against Christianity.
[62]  He was the chief editor of a very famous newspaper.
[63]  One day he heard Mr. Moody's preaching, and he repented and believed in the Lord.
[64]  But today I wish I had a fortune because of you; I wish I could have more money saved for you so that you would not have to wander outside.
[65]  One day I heard Mr. Moody preach the following words: Everyone talks about the father's prodigal son, but today I want to talk about the prodigal son's father.' When I heard that the Father was the same as my father, I believed and received the Lord Jesus as my Savior."
[66]  Perhaps someone will ask, "Does a sinner not have to repent before he believes in God and is saved?"
[67]  Let me tell you: do not reverse the order in the Bible.
[68]  Many people think, "I must have one basic act of righteousness and one basic act of goodness before God can look favorably on me."
[69]  Mephibosheth was afraid at first, but after being treated gracefully by David, he started to know himself, saying, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?" v. 8 . Romans 2:4 says, "Or...not knowing that God's kindness is leading you to repentance?" After knowing God's love, spontaneously one repents.
[70]  From the day the king departed until he came again in peace, Mephibosheth did not do three things: he "had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes" v. 24 . Brothers and sisters, do you know what this means? This is what I spoke about this morning; this is a widow's heart! Mephibosheth might have said, "David, who treated me graciously, is not here anymore.
[71]  Since the king was not there, he lost his heart for everything.
[72]  Second Samuel 21:7 says, "But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the Lord's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul."
[73]  David took care of Mephibosheth from the beginning to the end. Will God wrong us? If David could protect Mephibosheth from beginning to end, will God not keep us to the end?
[74]  THE SYMPATHY OF THE HIGH PRIEST Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Heb 4:15-16
[75]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was tempted in all things.
[76]  He felt pain when He suffered; He felt sorrow when He was misunderstood.
[77]  In order to sympathize with others, experience is not enough.
[78]  The Lord was able to sympathize with everyone while He was on the earth because He not only had the experience, but He also had the love.
[79]  NARRATION OF THE PAST Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Acts 14:26-27
[80]  This morning, we would like to follow the example of the apostles in a small, insignificant, and humble way to speak about what God's grace has done through us.
[81]  Therefore, we will not speak about any doctrine today.
[82]  During the first year following my conversion, I was unclear regarding the truths of the church, except that the sister who led me to the Lord had told me that unfortunately there were too many nominal Christians in the church today.
[83]  Also, I felt the character of the pastors I knew was too poor, for one did not ordinarily see them except when they came to ask for donations.
[84]  In this same year 1921 I went to the Bible regarding a number of questions.
[85]  I said to myself, "There are so many nominal Christians in the present day church, yet the Bible says that only the saved ones are in the church.
[86]  Besides, among the ones who came to break bread, some were regular movie-goers, some were habitual mahjong players, some even questioned whether or not the Lord Jesus could be considered a good man, and some were evidently not even children of God.
[87]  I also mentioned that there were some in the denominations who are clearly not the children of God and with whom I could not break bread, and that there was the further problem that according to them no one could break bread except the pastor.
[88]  During the latter half of 1922, I uncovered another problem from the Bible the problem of denominations.
[89]  Do the Scriptures say that I should be a member of the Methodist Church?
[90]  In 1 Corinthians 1 Paul exhorted the Corinthian believers not to be divisive by saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ."
[91]  If Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers for saying, "I am of Christ," surely for you to say that you are of the Presbyterian Church, while I am of the Methodist Church, and he is of the Baptist Church, is not scriptural.
[92]  At that time, I only gave a little testimony at the Shou-jin Chapel on North Szechuan Road.
[93]  I did not "establish a congregation" or "propagate my teaching," nor was I "not well received by the Shanghai community."
[94]  After we had been holding meetings for about a month, some young brothers among us felt that we should have a proper place to meet in the future.
[95]  But since we were short of money, it was beyond our means to do so.
[96]  I went to school to talk the matter over with several brothers, that is, with brothers Faithful Luke, Simon Meek, and Wang Tze, and we agreed that we should continue our work among the students.
[97]  Some doctors said that the disease I had contracted while in Amoy was probably fatal and that I could only expect to live a few months!
[98]  I was not afraid of death, but I could not help but think of what I had learned from the Lord during the many years before and the lessons I had experienced none of which had yet been put into writing.
[99]  The reason why we as well as many other brothers and sisters left the denominations is that denominationalism is a sin.
[100]  In 1926 I wrote to a bookstore in England for a few books, and I told them that I desired to have their books.
[101]  I had to tell him that I bought the books because I had left the denominations.
[102]  The Lord Jesus is a person in whom men can most easily confide.
[103]  We should realize that when we have a thorough talk with the Lord and pour out our heart to Him, our intimacy with the Lord is one step further, and we know Him a little more.
[104]  If a person has never shed tears before the Lord, if he has never shared his joy or sorrow with the Lord, and if he has never talked with the Lord about his private matters, he has never had any intimate fellowship with the Lord; he has never had any deep acquaintance with Him.
[105]  During the past few weeks, this passage of Scripture has often been in my heart.
[106]  As Christians, we should pay close attention to this portion of the Bible.
[107]  If we look at the words of this verse, there does not seem to be anything that we can get out of it.
[108]  Oh, what a loss to God if one brother or sister walks on the wrong path, unwilling to submit to Him!
[109]  Being likeminded will not only make God joyful but make His joy full.
[110]  I once brought a problem to a Western missionary.
[111]  I asked, "Does God demand more from the believers, or do the believers demand more from their fellow believers?
[112]  I considered that because we are so low and the Lord is so high, He would demand more.
[113]  I asked her for the reason, and she said, "What we can see are men's obvious failures; but what the Lord sees are men's hidden victories."
[114]  Later he wrote her a letter, saying, "After you left, I told God that I did not know what the cross was, or what the way of the cross was, or what it was to deny oneself?
[115]  This is one of the most serious verses in the whole Bible.
[116]  If you can escape the first thing God has reserved death, you can also escape the second thing God has reserved judgment.
[117]  Some may think, "When I stand before the judgment seat, I will say to God, You cannot send me to hell because I did not understand the message I heard.'"
[118]  Some sitting here today may say, "I do not understand; I am not clear; I can probably reason with God for an excuse when the time of judgment comes."
[119]  However, the Word of God says, "And though they hide at the top of Carmel, / From there I will seek them and take them" v. 3 . You may think that there are so many trees in the high mountains that if you hide there you can escape judgment.
[120]  But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
[121]  I know that there is a Son of God who bore my sins, and I know that there is a Son of God who shed His blood to redeem me from sins.
[122]  Before the United States was as flourishing as it is today, British and French immigrants lived on the East Coast of that country.
[123]  Several months ago, a certain Western missionary passed away in Fukien province.
[124]  I once remarked that among the people I have known, she was a very deep person in the Lord.
[125]  Since I am more knowledgeable about her affairs, I have considered writing a biography for her and have been collecting her lectures, articles, and essays for editing purposes.
[126]  A package of her belongings arrived several days ago including a piece of paper with the following words written on it: "O God, I thank You, because You have a commandment saying you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind!"
[127]  If you do not love all the brothers, the love of the Father is not in you; but if you have the love of God, you cannot help but love them.
[128]  First John 5:2-3 says, "In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments.
[129]  Why is it that we can keep God's commandments when we love Him?
[130]  Brothers and sisters, who among us dares to say that he has kept all the commandments that God has given us?
[131]  Though I have met many well-known children of God, I have yet to see but a few who know God.
[132]  Brothers and sisters, we must suffer for the Lord and willingly pay the price to take this way.
[133]  We must love the Lord so that He can reveal His glory to us.
[134]  James 1:12 says, "Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him."
[135]  When we love the Lord, we will not only love the brothers and keep God's commandments, but we will also rejoice that the Lord Jesus went to the Father.
[136]  If others would ask you, "Do you believe in the Lord?", the whole world would marvel if you answer, "I am one who loves the Lord."
[137]  This morning I want to tell the story of one person.
[138]  If we read Acts 7, we know that when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, God appeared to him and called him out of his country and his kindred to go into a land which God would show him.
[139]  Lot followed his uncle when he left Ur for Canaan because his uncle said that Ur of the Chaldees was a place of confusing morality that had been condemned by God and that they had to go to Canaan because God had called them to leave Ur.
[140]  I would like to mention one thing in passing.
[141]  Many places in the Bible symbolize the world: Ur of the Chaldees symbolizes the confusion of the world, Sodom and Gomorrah symbolize the pleasure of sin and the evil of the world, and Egypt symbolizes the fact that the world is under the authority of Satan.
[142]  The moment you realize that you cannot live with other Christians, you will find that you can no longer communicate with them.
[143]  The geography of Canaan is as follows: on the east side is the river Euphrates.
[144]  This was the river Euphrates which Abraham crossed from Ur of the Chaldees to Canaan.
[145]  You may think that it is all right that you have not entered Sodom, that you have not become apostate, and that you have not declared that you do not believe in the Lord Jesus.
[146]  If God says that these things have happened to you because you have forsaken Him, you should turn back.
[147]  Genesis 19:1 says that Lot sat at the gate of Sodom.
[148]  At that time the custom of all the countries in the east was not like today's court.
[149]  SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO Issue No. 39 Scripture Reading: Matt 9:38; Mark 11:22; 2 Cor 5:7; Rom 1:1, 14; 2 Cor 12:1, 4, 7; Gal 2:20; 2 Cor 4:10; Matt 13:9, 52; Hosea 7:8; Matt 5:48
[150]  This is why he could say, "Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ" 1 Cor 11:1 .
[151]  As far as knowledge is concerned, even God feared that Paul's knowledge would become too great.
[152]  He could say, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" Gal 2:20 .
[153]  She could believe even when she had nothing in her pocket.
[154]  Every time I was with her, she always said that she was down to the last dollar in her pocket.
[155]  The Lord preached to a most immoral woman, and this woman eventually turned to Him.
[156]  There are many times when you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of God asking you for water.
[157]  The Samaritan woman said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?...Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" vv.
[158]  The Lord answered by saying that if she knew two things, 1 the gift of God, and 2 who it was who was saying to her, "Give Me a drink," she would have asked of Him, and He would have given her living water.
[159]  If you want satisfaction today, you can have it right away; you do not have to wait until you have completed something to get it.
[160]  This is the principle of the world: when you have it, you have it; when you do not have it, you do not have it.
[161]  I like putting John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son," together with John 1:12, which says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God."
[162]  If you know this Jesus, you will surely say to Him, "You are the gift of God, please give me the living water that I may be satisfied."
[163]  "You would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" John 4:10 .
[164]  This is not our doing, but God's doing; it does not depend on our work, but on the redemptive work of the Lord; it is not what we are, but what the Lord is before God.
[165]  However, I beg you to hear God's Word: "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart...that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" Rom 10:8-9 .
[166]  If you said to God with your mouth, "I confess that Jesus is Lord," and if you believed in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, God would be unrighteous if you still went to hell.
[167]  "Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again" John 4:13 .
[168]  I do not know if you realize what thirst is.
[169]  But I must tell you that even if your dream comes true and your desires are fulfilled, you will not be satisfied; you will still dream and still say that there is a place within that is not yet satisfied.
[170]  If anyone among us would like to be satisfied, I can tell you the way.
[171]  The Lord Jesus said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" v. 14 . You will never thirst after you drink the water that the Lord gives you because the water will become a spring of water gushing up.
[172]  Once you receive Christ, He will be in you a spring so that you will be satisfied every day.
[173]  I have said before that we do not love the world because we have lost our taste for it or because we are disenchanted with the world, like some old folks who no longer enjoy the worldly blessings because they have lived long in this world.
[174]  THE WIDOW, THE WIFE, AND THE VIRGIN Issue No. 41 Scripture Reading: Luke 18:3; Rev 18:7; 17:1; Rom 7:2-4; 2 Cor 11:2-3
[175]  The verses today tell us that the church or Christians have three kinds of circumstances before God.
[176]  Before speaking about these three circumstances, I want to relate one thing first: there is a line from Genesis to Revelation of women being used by God to typify His children, His people.
[177]  In the verses which I have read today, God likens His children to women.
[178]  "For the married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband.
[179]  So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
[180]  So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead pay attention to this phrase , that we might bear fruit to God" Rom 7:2-4 .
[181]  The Bible not only tells us that we are a widow in the world; Romans 7 also says that every Christian is like a wife.
[182]  GOD SEARCHING MEN Issue No. 41 Scripture Reading: Rom 3:11-12; Luke 19:10
[183]  We thank and praise God that He does not require us to bring to Him cows and sheep, like the people in the Old Testament age, in order to meet Him.
[184]  OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING Issue No. 42 Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-7
[185]  Today we want to read carefully before God this portion of the Scripture which talks about the trespass offering.
[186]  I have already said that the trespass offering consists of two parts.
[187]  For example, if I offend Brother Wang and I confess before God, God cannot forgive me on behalf of Brother Wang.
[188]  If you offend man and do not deal with it properly, this sin will not cause you to lose your life, but it will cause you to lose your fellowship.
[189]  If we have committed these trespasses, what shall we do?
[190]  The following verses tell us what to do in our practice.
[191]  Once we realize that there is sin, we should deal with it.
[192]  Verse 4 continues, and verse 5 says, "He shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty."
[193]  Verse 5 says, "He shall make restitution for it in full...on the day he is found guilty."
[194]  This tells us that we should give back on the same day as our trespass offering and not wait any longer.
[195]  Once we are clear about something, there is no need to wait for the Holy Spirit to move us anymore; the Holy Spirit has already moved us and made known to us our trespass.
[196]  At the same time, we have to say, "O God, I know that I have offended someone in a certain matter, and I have already cleared it up with him.
[197]  If we do not clearly settle with man and only confess to God, our conscience will not be at peace, and we will not have the strength to believe that the Lord's blood can bring us forgiveness.
