   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you received any letters from Dr. Stearns? Have his wife and son arrived in Shanghai? Is there still a meeting in Wen-teh Lane? I really ask God to specially protect everyone who belongs to Him in this age and to give us new light so that we may walk in His will.</S>
