   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPORT OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following is a report on the work:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Building of the Big Meeting Hall</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How should Shanghai go on?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What kind of way should the church in Shanghai take?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The foremost question is the building of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Either we do not build anything at all, or we have to build a big hall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before the Lord, what we see is not just what we have right now.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The brothers and sisters should have some foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other than the big meeting hall, there is the need to divide the work into five districts: Chia-Bei, Yang-She-Pu, southern French Concession, Fu-She Road, and Inner-city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Shanghai has a population of 4.2 million; there are many things that need to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Foochow has only 320,000 people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Recently, a thousand people were added to Foochow, and there was no way that we could take care of them all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone Begetting and Nourishing</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>More important than business responsibilities, there are spiritual responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are works such as bringing friends to the gospel meetings, visiting new believers, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You should take care of the friends and relatives that you bring to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the new ones stand up in the meetings to answer the call, the speaker will not necessarily notice them, but you will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The speaker on the platform can be deceived through oversight, but you will not be deceived easily.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If every brother and sister will bring their own friends, men will not be saved in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can be very sure that certain ones are saved or not saved, and it will not be easy for false believers, or false brothers, to slip in.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After a person is saved, the more matured ones should take up the responsibility to care for him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes it takes five to ten persons to take care of one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to help such a one to read the Bible and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to follow up with him and check if he has consecrated himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not do your job, the brothers have to rise up to reproach you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have to see whether the new ones are coming to the meetings and what their family backgrounds are.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a brother cannot come for any reason, you have to go to him to make up the lessons for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Cheng, if you are the one responsible for the make-up lessons, and others do not come to the meetings, you cannot sit there and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the matter of preaching the gospel and the visitation of the new believers, I hope that every brother and sister will participate in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Caring for the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another more basic work is caring for the poor among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No matter how high a position a person occupies or how reputable his name is, he has to learn to go along with the lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should gather together all our used items, such as old clothing, old socks, and so forth, and invite those who cannot make a living otherwise to come and mend, wash, and iron this clothing, and we should preach the gospel to these people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether or not they will believe, we will still ask them to come to work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not do this, our heart will be too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By doing this our hearts will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many brothers and sisters do not have any patience with the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By doing this our hearts will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do this, one day we may not be able to find any used items in the church any longer; all the old things will have been given away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The early churches always cared for the poor Gal 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is wrong for a church to preach spiritual teachings only.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among us, every one of us has to deal with unbelievers, every one has to deal with new believers, and every one has to deal with poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Believers' Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Another matter we have to take care of is the edification of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have been Christians for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we go on, the more we are clear about the things that a Christian should have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are many basic truths that every Christian should know, such as rising up early, reading the Bible, praying, consecrating, dealing with one's past, dealing with money, meeting, singing hymns, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are fifty to sixty items of truth that every Christian should know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We workers have a bad habit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not like to repeat any message that we have preached before.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We hope that the manna will be different every day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In conducting the basic trainings, not only must we be strict regarding the topics, but we must pay much attention to checking on the practice of the new ones and overseeing them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the co-workers have to be living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are not living, we will produce something like the Common Prayer Book, which is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to make our service truly church service, everyone has to be living, and everyone has to take up some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The matter of serving the Lord is a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As such, everyone has to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we exhort others to serve, yet we have no work for them to do, our exhortation becomes impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must give everyone something to do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the whole church is working, no one will be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A Model of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that the church in Shanghai can be opened up for others to come and personally observe the way the work is conducted here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They can come and see how new ones are brought in and how they are being sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I hope that in the future we can see something spiritual established both in Shanghai and in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We expect to see that after a certain point everyone will be a priest, and everyone will aggressively preach the gospel and care for the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Migration</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The matter of migration depends on how much the brothers and sisters have learned the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If they have learned the lessons properly, they can migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, we have to help the new ones to serve both in business affairs and in spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All these must be practiced by the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to know how to deal with the new ones, and we have to know how to send these new ones out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not do this, we will not know how the other churches are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if we do this, we will help the other churches instead of just criticizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At the same time we hope that the brothers who are sent out will have the same footsteps and set up a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Those who are willing to join us can join us, and those who are afraid are free to go.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not enough to be recovered to the churches in the first century in doctrine only.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to offer up everything we have for God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Unless we are fully brought back to the beginning in our living and our practice, we are not doing any meaningful work.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We ourselves must first be brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The co-workers must consecrate themselves, and the brothers and sisters must also offer up their careers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This kind of consecration has to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to produce a group of Christians who are different, who glory in offering up everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to be such standard Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How can the brothers and sisters who are in their jobs serve God in an absolute way?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In order to do this, the co-workers must first consecrate themselves in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Only when the co-workers are absolute in their consecration can such consecration be wrought into the other working brothers and sisters.</S>
