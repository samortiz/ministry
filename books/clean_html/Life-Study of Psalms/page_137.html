<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Evildoers Being Cut Off but<br>Those Who Wait on Jehovah Possessing the Land</H2><P>Verses 9-40 point out that according to David's concept, the evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait on Jehovah will possess the land. David said, "For the evildoers will be cut off;/But those who wait on Jehovah,/They will possess the land./And in a little while longer there will be no wicked man;/Indeed, you will look diligently for his place, and he will not be there" (vv. 9-10). According to David's logic, in a little while there would be no wicked man. If there were no wicked man, we would not need the police, the law courts, or the government. But there is not such a thing on this earth today.</P><P>Again and again throughout Psalm 37, David said that the righteous would inherit the land and the wicked would be cut off. This is a principle set up by David's logic according to the principle of law-keeping. This logic, however, is altogether wrong. Such good logic belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><P>In the following message we will be on Psalms 40 and 41. Psalm 40 says that Christ will come to do the will of God (vv. 6-8), and the will of God is that Christ has to replace everyone, everything, and every matter. In the whole universe, God does not want anything except Christ. God wants only one person&#151;Christ. He wants Christ to replace all the offerings, to replace all things, to replace all matters, and to replace all men.</P><P>Paul said in Galatians 2:20a, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." Paul said that he had been terminated and that there was someone else to replace him&#151;Christ. He had been crucified and replaced by Christ. Christ lived in him. Paul spoke Galatians 2:20 in the context of his speaking concerning Christ replacing the law (vv. 11-21). He told the Galatians that they were foolish for trying to keep the law (3:1-3). David encouraged people to keep the law, but Christ crucifies, terminates, every law-keeper. Christ does not want to see anyone endeavoring to keep the law. He wants to see every law-keeper terminated by the cross.</P>
