<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Promising to Let Man Have Life<br>and Providing Man with Covering</H2><P>In the divine economy in the fall of man, God also promised to let man have life and provided man with covering (Gen. 3:20-21). The life here signifies God's eternal life, and the covering typifies God's coming redemption in Christ.</P><P>Realizing that they were sinful, Adam and Eve tried to cover their nakedness with aprons made of fig leaves. But God made them coats of skin and clothed them. God killed an animal, probably a lamb, and used the skin to make a covering for them. That was a type of His coming redemption in Christ.</P><P>In the divine economy in Genesis 3, there were two promises and a provision. God promised that one would come to destroy the serpent, and He promised to give the divine life to fallen man. Then He provided a covering to indicate that Christ would come to accomplish redemption to cover the fallen people so that they might be justified before God. This is a complete gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Issue of the Satanic Chaos</H2><P>In Genesis 3:22-24 we see that there was an issue of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Fallen Man Being Driven Out<br>from the Garden of Eden</H2><P>In His restoration of creation, God purposely created a garden of pleasure, which was called the garden of Eden. Due to the fall, man was driven out of that garden. This was the first aspect of the issue of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Entrance to the Tree of Life<br>Being Closed to the Fallen Man</H2><P>The second aspect of this issue was that the entrance to the tree of life was closed to the fallen man. The entrance would remain closed until Christ came to accomplish redemption and thus open again the way to the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. IN THE FURTHER STEPS<br>AND CONSUMMATION OF MAN'S FALL</H2><P>In the further steps and consummation of man's fall, we see more aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos. The fall of man had at least four steps, and then it reached its consummation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><P>In the divine economy God was very kind and merciful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Abel Accepting God's Promise<br>in Offering the Firstlings of His Flock<br>to Receive God's Respect</H2><P>Abel accepted God's promise in offering the firstlings of his flock to receive God's respect (Gen. 4:4). These firstlings typified Christ. Because God regarded Abel's offering, Abel was justified and accepted by God. According to the divine economy, Abel was recovered and justified.</P>
