<h2 class="head1">THE IMMEASURABLE CHRIST<br />MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2><p>Chapter three of Ephesians reveals three important things regarding Christ: that His riches are unsearchable, that He is making His home in our heart, and that His dimensions are universal. As we have pointed out, Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth. Who can say how broad is the breadth or how high is the height? Oh, we may experience the unsearchable riches of the immeasurable Christ! Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. Hallelujah for Christ in His immeasurable dimensions! We need to ask ourselves whether or not we know such a Christ.</p><p>Although Christ is immeasurable, He is still making His home in our hearts. The immeasurable Christ is a wonderful Person who makes His home in our hearts in a very intimate way. In order for Christ to make His home in our hearts, we need to be strengthened with power through the Spirit into our inner man. Then we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19).</p><p>The immeasurable Christ who is making home in us is the Spirit, on the one hand, and the very God of fullness, on the other hand. If we are strengthened by the Spirit and Christ makes His home in us, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God. Do not say that Christ is only the Son, but not the Spirit and not God the Father. Be careful that you are not under the influence of the systematized doctrine of Christianity. Christ is too wonderful to be systematized in doctrine. When He makes His home in us, the Spirit is strengthening us, and we are being filled unto the fullness of God.</p><p>Have you noticed that in Ephesians 3 Paul speaks of the Spirit, Christ, and God? The Spirit strengthens us, Christ makes home in us, and we are filled unto the fullness of God. Christ is the all-inclusive One. He is the Spirit who strengthens us, the Christ who makes His home in us, and the God who fills us unto His fullness. Many of us have read the book of Ephesians without ever seeing the vision of such a Christ. May we all see that the Christ whom we have received is the Spirit who strengthens and the God who fills us unto His fullness. I can testify that the Christ I enjoy is such a wonderful One.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESCENDING AND ASCENDING CHRIST</h2><p>In 4:9 and 10 Paul says, &ldquo;Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He Who descended is the same Who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.&rdquo; Christ has done a great deal of traveling in the universe. Firstly, He descended from heaven to earth in His incarnation. Then He descended further, from earth to Hades, the lower parts of the earth, in His death. Eventually, He ascended from Hades to earth in His resurrection, and from earth to heaven in His ascension. Through such a journey, He cut the way that He might fill all things. When Christ ascended up on high, to the third heaven, that was not the end of His traveling. After He ascended, He descended into our spirit. Therefore, Christ is the One who descends, ascends, travels, and comes to us in gracious visitations.</p><p>Today Christ is still traveling. He is still ascending and descending. However, His traveling takes place mainly within us. In our experience we may be up or down. When we are down, Christ comes down to where we are and brings us up to God. Many times during the course of a day we may be brought by Christ into the heavens. From our experience we can testify that within us Christ descends and ascends; He goes up and down. Although He is always steady, He does not stand still. On the contrary, He does a great deal of traveling within us.</p> <p>It is difficult to say where Christ is. Is He in heaven or on earth? If you say that He is on earth, you may have the sense that He is in heaven. But if you say that He is in heaven, you may soon realize that He is on earth. Actually, Christ is everywhere. According to 4:9 and 10, He descended and ascended in order to fill all things. Do you think that Christ will fill all things in the universe without also filling you? Through His descending and ascending, Christ will fill us with Himself.</p>
