   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORIGIN OF THE SPIRIT BEING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every matter or thing has its origin, nature, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit also has its origin, nature, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the origin of the spirit is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that gold often comes from the refined ore of a gold mine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of the ore contains the nature of gold, and through the refining process, gold is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the origin of gold is the gold mine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, because God is Spirit, the origin of the spirit is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, if someone asks what a table is, we can say that the essence of a table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone asks what man is, we can say that the essence of man is flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If someone asks what a book is, we can say that the essence of a book is paper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wood is the essence of a table, flesh and blood are the essence of man, and paper is the essence of a book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every item has its essence, and its essence is based upon its origin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is the origin, in God is an essence, and this essence is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what the Bible reveals to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD S ESSENCE BEING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible also says that God is love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s being love denotes God s nature, and God s being light refers to His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, these are not something of God s essence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For instance, if a lamp is not connected to the electricity, it will not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The shining of a lamp is the expression of electricity, but it is not the essence of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have never seen electricity, but we have seen the expression of the electricity the shining of a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The expression of electricity, however, is not the essence of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us use another example.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The heat that comes from an electric heater is the expression of the electricity but not the essence of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a distinction between the essence and the expression of a certain object.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult to explain the essence of the Spirit because no one has ever seen the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, some Christians know the Spirit, but on the other hand, no Christian can see the essence of the Spirit, the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we cannot see the Spirit, the Spirit manifests Himself in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can experience the presence of the Spirit, see the manifestation and power of the Spirit, and touch and contact the Spirit in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the revelation of the Bible, God is Spirit; the essence, the substance, of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we say that God is with us, we mean that the Spirit is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s being in us is the Spirit s being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we fellowship with God, we are fellowshipping with the Spirit; when we touch God, we are touching the Spirit because God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have the Spirit, we have God; if we lose the Spirit, we lose God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no God outside of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>GOD CREATING A SPIRIT IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FOR MAN TO CONTAIN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible also reveals to us that it pleases God to mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is God s purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Genesis tells us that God created man in His image and according to His likeness 1:26 because the purpose of God s creation of man is that man would be a vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, a Coca-Cola bottle is made to contain Coca-Cola.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The appearance of a bottle indicates its purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The reason God created man exactly the same as He is is so that He may put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the process through which God puts Himself into man is not that simple, because God is too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God as Spirit cannot put Himself into man, unless man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the Bible tells us that when God created man, He not only created man in His image, but He also created a spirit in man 2:7; Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God Himself is the uncreated, eternal Spirit, and in order for this uncreated, eternal Spirit to come into man, God created a spirit for man.</S>
