   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is all I will say.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If I say more, my heart will not be happy and will not improve anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But I would present this most solemn matter before those who love Christ honestly and who honor Him faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The teaching of Balaam is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a shame this is to the Lord's name!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this is the only way to maintain the church and to support the preachers, why not let this work fall to pieces?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a Christian cannot go on without the world, he will soon find out that the world can go on without him!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Pharisees of old were wiser than the Christians of today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They said of the pieces of silver that "it is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money" Matt 27:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because man does not believe in God's power and love, he devises many ways to fill up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if God truly does not have the power and the love, why do we have to spend the effort to do something in His name?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God is liable to fail, why do we not just allow Him to fail?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God can fail, what purpose is there for us to plan so much?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If He cannot fail, does not planning expose our utter lack of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where in the Bible does it record a campaign for money with organizational ways?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who give should give "as a blessing and not as a matter of covetousness...each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver" 2 Cor 9:5b, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God does not want an offering from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What He wants is a willing consecration from His children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where can we find in the Bible the system of hired workers?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is true that "to the one who works" there is the reward Rom 4:4 and that it is right that "those who announce the gospel...live from the gospel" 1 Cor 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But who is the one who hires the preacher?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whose servants are they?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are Christians offering money to hire preachers, or are they offering money to God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are the preachers the workers of God or are they the workers of church members?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God can certainly use His people to give money to His workers, but to the giver, it should not be a matter of remuneration to the preacher but a matter of offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the receiver, he should not consider the amount of work he does as the basis for the amount of money he should receive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead he should receive everything from God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord's believers cannot give without using a certain method, will God then be short of their money?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why do we need their money anyway?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a servant of God cannot trust in the Lord fully, he should change to another profession and should earn an honest wage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not give us one instance of a servant of God looking to man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When wages are stopped, the hired ones are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, God's work will not be affected by money.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will prevent having useless ones among the servants of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have said before, and I will say it again, that if we cannot act by God's way, it is better that we not act at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is better to let the work fall than to use human inventions to replace the divine institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If one wants to offer, he has to do so willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If one wants to work, he has to trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anything else will not please the Lord and should be rejected by those who faithfully love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the result of the teaching of Balaam?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, it is idolatry, and second, it is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At present, in addition to these actual sins, believers have many similar spiritual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to avoid being conspicuous, the believers have absorbed many heathen festivals and traditions and have christianized them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They utilize many heathen festivals as a time to give ground to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the end, what we have is a mixed religion, with Christianity contributing the name and the idol worshippers contributing the teaching, the ceremonies, and the reality!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is the present church truly free from the power of idols?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is an idol?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is the setting up of something that man has made and worshipping it as god.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who consider man's work as God are in reality worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much has the present church been freed from the realm of human work being taken as God?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where can a present believer show his distinction from the world?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not mean a distinction from the Chinese customs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How many are there in the church who can completely reject festivals, traditions, and other idolatrous things?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Or is there still the compromise, beautifying itself with a good name and utilizing this name?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is true that in many things the church is different from the Chinese customs, but can we say that it is different from the world?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am afraid that it is different from others, not because of the fact that it is Christian, but because of westernization!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The god of this world is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who follow the customs of this age are liable to idolatry in inclination and in fact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we, the little ones, the ones who have believed in the Lord, should flee idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the matter of fornication, is the church behind the Israelites?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible clearly considers the receiving of heresy as a kind of spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To befriend the world is also a kind of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although Christianity boasts of its power to integrate the worldly teachings, theories, and philosophies what the Bible calls "the elements" and to turn them into the so-called western Christian culture, the Lord rebukes this as fornication!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christianity cares little for the loss of its standing, and in satisfying the appetite of the world overturns its own faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The mind of the unregenerated man is very much lacking in standard and is full of darkness and error, yet this is what the so-called world culture is all about!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The present so-called Christianity is not preaching Christ's death and resurrection but has instead become a totality of the worldly minds.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As the tide of the age changes, unconsciously its position shifts gradually downstream.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Periodically there are adjustments, but only for the purpose of making itself more compatible to the age.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In fashioning its minds to become more modern, Christianity has drifted further away from its source!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is true that Christians are zealous, but for what reason?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am afraid it is for the reason of maintaining the name of their Christian denominations!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As long as Christianity can exist in name, it is ready to sacrifice the existence of the fundamental teachings!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But then, if Christianity is regressing, why not allow it to disappear, and why not set up a new religion?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why do we have to labor and be so busy stocking the goods only for the purpose of keeping such a shop running?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is a shocking fornication that the present church has committed in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, who considers this as being wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some things are clearly worldly and some people clearly love the world and make friends with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yet all these are given the beautiful name of service and reform.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God leaves His church in the world at this present age in order that it may be a witness to the world of the sin of crucifying His Son and of its impossibility for reform.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God's only work is to save a group of people in the world and to gather them under His Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the church takes in the teaching of Balaam, she becomes a colony of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The present world no longer becomes simply a way for the church to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Instead, it is developed as much as possible with the hope that it can eventually become the eternal home of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thus, some have thought that the kingdom of heaven would be realized on earth through the church's work, and the church would remain on earth for millennia.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Hence, education, labor, economy, politics, international relationships, and hundreds of other issues should all be studied and improved.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, while the church is busily engaged in all these activities, she has already lost her chastity completely!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Through the introduction of the teaching of Balaam, the church has married the world.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is no lack of new terms invented by wise ones, but the Lord calls all these activities idolatry and fornication.</S>
