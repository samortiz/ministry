   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Helping of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does the phrase in like manner mean?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why does Paul say this?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult to understand this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that it has an all-inclusive meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner includes all the points of the foregoing verses expecting, eagerness, groaning, endurance, hope, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase in like manner relates to all of these points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While we are groaning, the Holy Spirit also is groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While we are expecting, He is expecting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While we are hoping and enduring, He is hoping and enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever we are, He is also the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In like manner the Spirit joins in to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a comfort this is!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While we are groaning, watching, and expecting, He is also groaning, watching, and expecting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is just the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are weak, He apparently is weak also, although actually He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He sympathizes with our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He appears to be weak for the sake of our weakness that He might participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we loudly pray, O, Father, He also prays loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also prays softly when we pray softly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say, O Father, I m so pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we pray in this way, He also prays for us in like manner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In whatever way we pray, He also prays.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In whatever way we are, He also is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we pray quickly, rejoicingly, and shoutingly, He also prays in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our manner is His manner.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that the Holy Spirit is so different from us that when we receive the Holy Spirit we will be extraordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not the thought contained in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 8 reveals that the Holy Spirit is in our manner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sisters, are you disappointed?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some sisters say, We cannot shout.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot pray loudly as the brothers do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of this, it seems that we have been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Be comforted, sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit prays in your manner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In whatever manner you are, He also is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul also says that the Spirit joins in to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He participates in our weakness in order to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit does not ask us to join in with Him; He joins in with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit does not say, Come up to the highest standard to join Me. None of us can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the Spirit joins in in our manner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If your manner is quick, He will also be quick.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are slow, He will be slow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Try to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether you pray strongly or weakly, loudly or softly, it does not matter to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you pray, He will pray in you in like manner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In like manner He will join in to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a man is crippled and I want to help him walk, I have to take his manner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, if I want to approach a little boy, I must do it in his way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I should not say, Little boy, I am a big giant who has come to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I do this, the boy will look at me and say, I do not want you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are too different from me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I want to help the little boy, I must shorten myself and squeeze myself into being a little boy and say, May I play with you?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I say this, the little boy will be happy and respond, Good!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let s play together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that I join in to help him in his manner.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes the older brothers in the church life are too big, too high.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although they try to help the saints, they do not help them in the saints manner.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the day of resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to two disciples who were on the way to Emmaus Luke 24:13-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord joined them absolutely in their manner.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While they were talking, the Lord Jesus pretended not to know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He seemed to ask, What are you talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The two disciples rebuked Him, Don t you know the things that have come to pass in these days?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord said, What things?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They said, The man Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet mighty in deed and word, has been condemned to death and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus neither rebuked them nor revealed Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He kept Himself in their manner, walking with them until they came near to the village.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They asked Him to abide with them and He did.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As they were seated in the room, the Lord took bread and broke it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only then were their eyes opened to see that it was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When they realized that He was the Lord, He disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the church life the older brothers and sisters need to help the younger ones in their manner.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They need to join in to help in their weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>None of us is so strong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all are groaning, expecting, and saying, O Lord, when?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Day by day we are suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Nevertheless, the Holy Spirit is present, joining in to help us in our manner.</S>
