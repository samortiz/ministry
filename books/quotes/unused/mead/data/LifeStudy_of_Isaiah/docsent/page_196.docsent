   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE KING REIGNING IN THE TENT OF DAVID,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ETERNAL ROCK,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A SAVIOR A DEFENDER,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND A TEACHER Scripture Reading: Isa 16:5; 24:23; 26:3-4; 17:10; 30:29; 19:20; 30:20-21</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to see four more items of the all-inclusive Christ in the book of Isaiah: the King reigning in the tent of David, the eternal Rock, a Savior a Defender, and the Teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE KING REIGNING IN THE TENT OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Isaiah 16:5, the all-inclusive Christ is the King reigning in the tent of David.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may wonder what this aspect of Christ has to do with us since Christ will reign as a king in the tent of David in the coming age during the restoration of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to realize, however, that we can also enjoy Christ as the reigning One in the tent of David in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospels show that Christ is intimately related to David.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of Luke was of course written by Luke, a Gentile, and it was basically written to Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Luke reports the angel telling Mary that the One conceived in her womb would be given "the throne of David His father" 1:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The One that Mary would bring forth would be a descendant of David and would inherit the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does this have to do with the new testament believers?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to realize that, according to Hebrews 6:5, the age of grace, the new testament age, is a foretaste of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, the age of grace is a miniature of the coming age, and the coming age is the consummation of the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not in the coming age of the kingdom yet, but we are in its miniature, the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, what we are enjoying today is a foretaste of the coming kingdom in the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Divine healing is a part of the restoration in the coming age, but today in the age of grace we may also enjoy and receive divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a foretaste of the power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As ones who are saved by grace, we are enjoying Christ in the age of grace as the miniature of the coming age.</S>
