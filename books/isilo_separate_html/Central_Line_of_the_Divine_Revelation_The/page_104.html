By Being One with the Believers<br>to Partake of the Oneness<br>of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by being one with the believers to partake of the oneness of the Divine Trinity that the people of the world may believe in Him (17:21). Oneness is a particular attribute of the Divine Trinity. The three of the Trinity are one, and we can participate in this oneness by being one. The more we are one with the believers, the more we are in the oneness of the Trinity. This is a corporate blessing. When we are not one with the brothers and sisters, we suffer. When we are one, we enjoy the riches of the Triune God. This is the participation in the Divine Trinity in Their oneness. Their oneness becomes our oneness, and as They coinhere, we coinhere with Them. Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father. These four coinhere together in oneness. The New Testament speaks strongly against division. Romans 16:17 says, "Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them." Division diminishes our enjoyment of the Triune God in Their triune oneness. To have such an enjoyment is a great blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>24. By Receiving His Breathing to Enjoy Him<br>as the Pneumatic Christ</H2><P>We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by receiving His breathing to enjoy Him as the pneumatic Christ (John 20:22). The Lord is breathing Himself out, and we are receiving not simply His breath but His breathing, which includes His person. This is our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>25. By Loving Him in Feeding His Lambs<br>and Shepherding His Sheep<br>for His Flock&#151;the Church</H2><P>The last way revealed in the Gospel of John to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by loving Him in feeding His lambs and shepherding His sheep for His flock&#151;the church (21:15-17). Feeding the lambs, the young ones, takes place in the home meetings, and shepherding the sheep takes place in the group meetings. Feeding Christ's lambs and shepherding His sheep are for His flock, the church, which is His heart's desire and God's good pleasure (Eph. 1:9). This is also the way for us to enjoy the Triune God.</P><P>By all the preceding points we can see that the Gospel of John is a book on the dispensing of the Triune God and the receiving of this dispensing by the believers through their breathing, eating, and drinking of Him and their abiding in Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_103.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_105.html">Next</a> </body></html>
