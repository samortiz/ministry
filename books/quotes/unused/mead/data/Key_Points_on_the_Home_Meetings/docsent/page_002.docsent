   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE RECOVERING THE SPEAKING FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter there are a number of specific things that I wish to discuss with you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ALL SAVED ONES PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND SPEAKING GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, let me speak about the change of our system.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since October 1984, the main goal of our changing the system was to recover the home meetings as they are revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible clearly says that every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every member can function in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Body of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I stand before you to speak, apparently, it is my mouth that speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But actually, it is my whole being which speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I put on an artificial nose, you can tell immediately that it is not real, because there is a difference between something artificial and something real.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Artificial things are dead, while real things are living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a person is living, he is simply living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even when he is not moving, he still bears a living expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I were to stand before you, although I may not be moving, you could see that my nose, mouth, and face all bear a living expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A brass or wooden statue is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter how much it resembles a real person, everyone knows it is false as soon as it is placed before him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person has many members in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether the livingness of these members is strong or weak depends on whether his physical strength is full or lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I am full of strength, then I will have a powerful appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, if I am sick, I will have little vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the life of the Lord Jesus within us is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We become His members through His life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In principle, we who have the life of Christ and who become the members of Christ s Body should be full of life and vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the condition of most Christians today is exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The problem is that the clergy-laity system has killed most of the functions of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they meet, the only active ones are the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When it is time to sing, there is the song leader; when it is time to preach, there is the preacher; when it is time to pray, there is the prayer minister.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems that in this technological age even religious worship has become a matter of division of labor; every person just takes care of his own part.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kills the function of the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In changing our system, what we are doing is to change our meetings back to the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the Bible, in the meetings every saved one should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Acts 5:42 says, And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They met from house to house, teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here, to preach is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later another five thousand were added.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After they were saved, these eight to ten thousand people met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time they probably had not been saved more than a month, yet they all began to preach the gospel and teach Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is clear that in the beginning, when the Lord raised up the first church on the earth, everyone spoke; everyone was a speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the positive side, the word of the Lord went out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the negative side, this prevented any leader from being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If everyone speaks in a meeting, no one can be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, if in a meeting you do not speak and I do not speak, but only one speaks, then that one becomes a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more he leads, the better he becomes at leading.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a while, he will become an expert.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first he takes the lead only in the small meetings; gradually, he leads the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At first he leads in only one locality; gradually, he leads in a whole region.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way the clergy-laity system is developed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Dear brothers and sisters, speaking from our conscience, are not the co-workers among us a kind of clergy in our eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is difficult for us to treat the co-workers as ordinary brothers, because the concept of clergy-laity has been deeply rooted in us already.</S>
