<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM REASON</h2><p>There is another lesson which we have to learn: All those who reason with God are actually not reasoning with Him, but rebelling against Him. This means they are rebelling and offending God's authority. The law of gravity operates in such a way that the lower an object is, the steadier it becomes. Those who remain in a low position before God have the greatest stability. The more a man lays low and the more he prostrates himself in the dust, the more rest he has. Those who stand on a table are more liable to fall down, but those who have fallen will not fall further. A man who has fallen needs someone to lift him up before he can walk. Once a man sees God's authority, all reasons go away. The more reasons a man has, the less experience he has of God's authority.</p><p>Numbers 16 shows us another rebellion among the people of Israel after the rebellion of Korah's company with the two hundred fifty leaders. The people accused Moses of killing God's people. This rebellion was a rebellion of the entire congregation. Even though the earth opened its mouth and swallowed Korah's company and the two hundred fifty men, the people were still blind to God's authority. They were reasoning even more than before. Finally, God was forced to judge them and punish them with the plague. Reasons come before rebellion. The root of rebellion is our reasons. In order to be delivered from rebellion, God must first deliver us from reasons.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERTHROWING THE STRONGHOLD OF REASON</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us that reasoning is a kind of stronghold. In order to obey Christ, a man must take captive his every thought and overthrow the stronghold of reasonings. Verse 5 says, "As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ." Every high thing refers to everything that hinders a man from the knowledge of God. The greatest of these things is reasonings. Once a man reasons with God, this reasoning becomes a high thing in the eyes of God. Paul said that these strongholds must be overthrown. They are erected by Satan, and they are related to reasons. When a man is not subject to Christ, he is bound by these strongholds. A man is able to obey Christ only by overthrowing these strongholds and taking captive these thoughts. Reasonings are strongholds erected by Satan. As soon as a man reasons, his thoughts are taken captive; they become bound by his reasons. The Word of God tells us how strongly reasonings influence man's whole being. Do not regard reasonings as a small thing. Once reasonings come in, thoughts become rebellious, and words and actions follow. If we can overthrow our reasons, our thoughts will spontaneously obey the Lord, and all problems will be solved.</p><p>Satan tries to imprison man with thoughts and reasons. Our thoughts are rebellious because they have been carried away by our reasons. The more reasons we have, the less we can overcome our thoughts. Everything that Satan does is backed up by reasons. He does not speak in vain; he erects strongholds within a man's thoughts and garrisons them so that the man cannot run away. Do not think that we are free when we reason within ourselves in our own room. We have to realize that we are a prisoner, chained and locked inside iron gates and walls. There is no way for us to free ourselves. There is no way for us to obey Christ. We can call 2 Corinthians 10 the "Jessie Penn-Lewis chapter." No one can match her clarity of understanding about the freedom of a Christian's mental state. Whether or not Christ's authority is in control depends on how a man thinks and how free his thoughts are, and how free a man's thoughts are depends on how much he is delivered from reasonings. Paul said that in order to overthrow the mental strongholds, a man must be powerful before God. He must overthrow reasonings with spiritual weapons so that his thoughts may be captured back to the obedience of Christ.</p><p>In reading 2 Corinthians 10, we are easily reminded of the story of Eve's rebellion against God in Genesis 3, which can be considered as a footnote to 2 Corinthians 10. Satan did not persuade Eve to sin. He merely reasoned with Eve and stirred her up to think. She looked and saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was pleasing to the eyes. She thought that the fruit was good for food and that the fruit would open her eyes and give her discernment between good and evil. There were wonderful reasons behind her action. Satan stirred up her thoughts by asking one question. As a result, Eve began to reason, and the end of this reasoning was her eating of the fruit. Action comes after reasons. After Eve reasoned with herself, she decided to ignore God's command. She thought that she could eat the fruit. She ignored God's word and allowed reasoning to come in. Please remember that reasoning has no place in the pathway of obedience. The pathway of obedience does not have any trace of reasonings. In the world no one will do anything without a reason, but in the spiritual realm, the more reasons and thoughts a person has, the less likely he will obey. For a Christian, reasons are Satan's strongholds. They close up a man's thoughts and rob him of his freedom. As soon as a man reasons, his thoughts are taken hostage. Man's reasons are always joined to his thoughts. As soon as thoughts are taken hostage, a man cannot obey Christ. If we want to be a free man and want to obey Christ, we have to overthrow the reasons in the mind with our spiritual weapons.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO TOUCH AUTHORITY</h2><p>The obedience we are speaking of today is different from the obedience that men spoke of in the past. We are saying that a man must first touch authority before he submits. There is a big difference between submission that comes after one encounters authority and submission that comes without any encounter with authority. After a man recognizes God's authority, his obedience will have a different flavor. His previous obedience was lower in quality. The new obedience is much higher in quality. Only one who has touched God's authority will possess genuine submission and know God's will. Everything depends on whether or not a man has touched God's authority. Once this matter is settled, all other problems are solved. Once this issue is dealt with, all revilings will stop, and all reasoning will cease.</p><p>If the Lord reveals Himself to us today, we will behave differently when we walk into the kitchen tomorrow; we will act obediently according the cook's order. When we come together, we will not need to form a committee to discuss the order of submission. Our reasonings and thoughts will be captured, and we will do nothing but look for those to whom we should submit. Those who are under authority obey the Lord's commands; their eyes are not set on how others behave. Instead, they identify the authority that rests in others and obey accordingly. In no other passage of the Bible do we find God speaking to His children like He does in Romans 9. This chapter shows us that God never reasons. In other places we find examples of reasonings. Romans 6, 7, and 8 all have fine reasonings. God has a basis for doing things, but Romans 9 tells us that God's selection is based on His will, His calling, His choice, and His sovereignty; no reasons need be given. Here we touch God Himself. He is the Lord high above, and we should prostrate ourselves before His authority. True worship comes not only from the cross but from a knowledge of God's authority. When we see that He is high above, we will realize how small we are. This contrast will invoke us to genuine worship. We do not have to know whether God's actions are good or bad. We only need to know that God has done it and be satisfied with it. Once we see that the Lord occupies the highest place, we will render Him the greatest worship.</p><p>Once we know God's glory and authority, our reasonings and rebellious thoughts will go away. May the Lord have mercy on us so that the eyes of our understanding would not be blinded by Satan through our reasonings and thoughts. May we not take the way of the recovery in vain. May the Lord deliver us from all reasons, all spirits of rebellion, and all defiant thoughts.</p>
