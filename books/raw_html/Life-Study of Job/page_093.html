<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FINAL OUTCOME, UNDER GOD'S CONSUMMATION,<br>OF THE PROGRESSIVE DIVINE REVELATION<br>IN THE NARRATION OF THE STORY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 42</H1><P>In this message we will consider chapter forty-two of the book of Job. This chapter reveals the final outcome, under God's consummation, of the progressive divine revelation in the narration of the story of Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JOB GAINING GOD IN HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE<br>AND ABHORRING HIMSELF</H2><P>"I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear,/But now my eye has seen You;/Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent /In dust and ashes" (vv. 5-6). This indicates that Job gained God in his personal experience (in addition to knowing God in his vain knowledge by tradition) and that he abhorred himself.</P><P>Seeing God equals gaining God (Matt. 5:8). To gain God is to receive God in His element, in His life, and in His nature. Eventually, this not only makes us one with God&#151;it even makes us a part of God. I prefer not to use the phrase "one with" in describing our relationship with God because to be made a part of God, to be constituted with God in His life and nature, is more than being one with God. We see God that we may be constituted with God, yet we do not have any share in the Godhead.</P><P>All God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified people will see God's face (Rev. 22:4). Seeing God transforms us (2 Cor. 3:18), because in seeing God we receive His element into us. As we receive God, a new element comes into us, and the old element is discharged. This metabolic process is transformation. To see God is to be transformed into the glorious image of God. This makes us a part of God that we may express God in His life and represent Him in His authority.</P><P>Job said not only that He saw God but also that he abhorred himself. According to our experience, the more we see God and love God, the more we abhor ourselves. The more we know God, the more we deny ourselves.</P>
