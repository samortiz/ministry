<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of twelve messages given by Brother Witness Lee concerning redemption in God&rsquo;s plan. The dates and places where the messages were given are not known. The messages were originally published in Chinese in consecutive issues of <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1951 to 1954.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:4-5, 9, 11; 3:11; Rom. 8:28-29; Heb. 2:10</h1>
<h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION IN GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning redemption in God&rsquo;s plan. Let us read a few portions in the Scriptures concerning God&rsquo;s plan. Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.&rdquo; According to this verse, God&rsquo;s selection was made before the foundation of the world. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us...according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; According to Darby&rsquo;s New Translation of the Bible, the word <em>predestinating</em> means &ldquo;to mark out beforehand.&rdquo; God marked us out beforehand, determined our destiny, according to the good pleasure of His will. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;According to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself.&rdquo; God graces us according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself through His plan. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.&rdquo; The word <em>purpose</em> here refers to God&rsquo;s plan. We were predestinated by God according to His plan. Verse 11 of chapter 3 says, &ldquo;According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The eternal purpose is the eternal plan that God made in eternity past.</p>
<p>The above verses show that God had a good pleasure before the foundation of the world. This is what pleased God in eternity past. God&rsquo;s good pleasure became His purpose, and based on His purpose, He made a plan in Himself. In this plan God chose and predestinated us. Then in time He called and redeemed us according to His plan. Hence, our redemption is through God&rsquo;s plan and in God&rsquo;s plan. Our redemption was not random, accidental, or by chance; rather, it was planned by God. In eternity past, before time began, God made a plan to redeem us according to the purpose of His good pleasure.</p>
<p>We often think that our salvation was by chance. However, from God&rsquo;s perspective we were predestinated unto salvation; our salvation was planned by Him. Before the foundation of the world God planned our salvation in Himself according to the purpose of His good pleasure.</p>
<p>In 1937 I met an elderly Western missionary who had come to preach the gospel in China at the end of the Ching Dynasty. While I was giving a message, I asked her when she was saved. When she answered that she had been saved for more than fifty years, I said that I was saved before her, because I was saved before the foundation of the world. God had already determined to save me before the foundation of the world. In eternity past God predestinated me and marked me out for salvation. Hence, from God&rsquo;s point of view I was saved before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption is not a last-minute remedy to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s fall. Redemption is God&rsquo;s eternal plan. It was not added as an afterthought; it was determined before the beginning of time. Even though redemption was accomplished in time, God planned redemption before time began, even before the foundation of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; God predestinated us so that we might have the sonship. According to Romans 8:28, those who love God have been called according to His purpose. But what is God&rsquo;s purpose? Verse 29 says that those whom God &ldquo;foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; God in His purpose predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son so that Christ might be the Firstborn among many brothers. Hebrews 2:10 says that Christ is leading many sons into glory. Hence, God&rsquo;s purpose is to lead many sons into glory.</p>
<p>The verses above show that God predestinated and called us to receive the sonship so that we would become His many sons and so that Christ might be the Firstborn among many brothers. The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan is to lead many sons into glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing God&rsquo;s Salvation<br />
from God&rsquo;s Perspective</h2>
<p>The common understanding of God&rsquo;s salvation is not high. Most people view God&rsquo;s salvation from the human perspective. A brother might say that he was miserable and on his way to hell because of his sins; therefore, God saved him out of pity. Although such an answer is not wrong, it is very basic. This brother understands God&rsquo;s salvation from the human perspective, not from God&rsquo;s perspective. This brother knows God&rsquo;s salvation according to himself, not according to God.</p>
<p>Most of the saints understand God&rsquo;s salvation according to their feelings. They think that God saved them because they were sinful and pitiful. They believe in the Lord because they want to receive forgiveness of sins, peace, and joy and also because they want someone to rely on, they want to be delivered from the lake of fire, and they want to enter into the kingdom of God. These reasons are right, but they are according to our feelings. If we would be willing to enter into God&rsquo;s feeling and consider His view, we would understand God&rsquo;s salvation in a different way.</p>
<p>The Bible presents two sides of God&rsquo;s salvation. One side is from the human perspective, and the other side is from God&rsquo;s perspective. Ephesians speaks of God&rsquo;s salvation from God&rsquo;s perspective, which is a higher view&mdash;a view from heaven to earth, from God to man. Romans, however, speaks of God&rsquo;s salvation from the human perspective, which is a lower view&mdash;a view from earth to heaven, from man to God. Although Romans begins with the human perspective, it ascends step by step and reaches God&rsquo;s plan in chapter 8. Most people talk about God&rsquo;s salvation from the human perspective. They remain on a lower level without ascending to a higher level. In this chapter we will ascend to God and to heaven in order to look at salvation from the perspective of God, heaven, and eternity.</p>
<p>If we look at salvation from God&rsquo;s perspective instead of from our perspective, from heaven instead of from earth, and from eternity instead of from time, we will see that the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is high and great. God&rsquo;s salvation includes forgiveness, peace, joy, deliverance from the lake of fire, and entrance into the kingdom of God. As soon as a person is saved, his sins are forgiven, and he has peace and joy, and a saved person will certainly enter the kingdom of God instead of going to the lake of fire. However, these things are not God&rsquo;s purpose in saving us. God&rsquo;s purpose for saving us is much higher than these things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Desiring That We Receive the Sonship and<br />
Be Conformed to the Image of His Son</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan, which He made according to His good pleasure, is high and great. This purpose is for His redeemed ones to receive the sonship, that is, to have the life of His Son and to be conformed to the image of His Son so that the Son may be the Firstborn among many brothers.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire for us to receive the sonship means that He wants us to be like Him. A son has the life of his father; hence, he looks like his father. To receive the sonship is to receive God&rsquo;s life in order to be like Him. According to God&rsquo;s plan, His purpose in redeeming us is for us to receive His life and thus have His image. The Lord Jesus is the Son of God; hence, He has the life of God. The life of God is in His Son (1 John 5:11). Therefore, he who has the life of the Son of God has the life of God (v. 12).</p>
<p>The Son of God has the life of God and also the image of God in order to declare God (Col. 1:15; John 1:18). Hence, to be conformed to the image of the Son of God is to be conformed to the image of God (Rom. 8:29). The Son of God has the life of God and thus declares God in the universe. God desires that we would receive the sonship so that we would have His life and express His image in the universe.</p>
<p>Without Jesus Christ, the Son of God, there would be no way for God to be declared. God is manifested through the Son. The Son of God is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3). When people saw the Son of God, they saw God (John 14:9).</p>
<p>Initially, the Lord Jesus was the only begotten Son of God, having the life and image of God and declaring God among men (1:18). The Bible, however, reveals that God desires to have many sons who possess His life and express His image. It is marvelous that God desired this even before the foundation of the world. This desire became God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and His mysterious plan (Eph. 1:4-5, 9, 11; 3:11). According to God&rsquo;s desire, eternal purpose, and mysterious plan, He wants to put us in the Son as the model so that we would be conformed to the image of His Son. For this reason, God caused us to receive the life of His Son, which is His own life, and to have the image of His Son, which is His own image. This is the way that God gains many sons, who have His life and His image in order to declare Him in the universe. Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, now has many brothers as His companions, making Him the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). This is God&rsquo;s good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself. This will be accomplished by God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and this is the goal of God&rsquo;s mysterious plan.</p>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan is to gain many sons. The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to conform man to the image of His Son. When we received the Lord, God put the life of His Son into our being. From that day onward, He causes all things to work together in coordination with the working of the Holy Spirit to conform us to the image of His Son (vv. 28-29).</p>
<p>The day that we were saved, God put us in His Son as the model. God is now working to conform us to His Son. We are saved, but many parts of our being still do not express the Son of God. The life of the Son of God is in us, but God still needs to do a conforming work in our being so that we would express the image of the Son of God. God is working to conform us until we express the image of His Son (v. 29), that is, until we are brought into the glory of His Son (Heb. 2:10). This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. This is the purpose of redemption.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1, 26-27, 31; 2:7-9, 16-17; Psa. 90:2; Eccl. 7:29; Rev. 4:11</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that in eternity past God had a plan. In that plan He purposed to gain many brothers for His Son. These many brothers have the life of the Son and the image of the Son and will eventually enter into glory.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will see how God carries out His plan. In order to carry out His plan, God created all things. This was the first step in carrying out His plan. However, in order to understand creation, we must first see God&rsquo;s characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>Psalm 90:2 says that God is &ldquo;from eternity to eternity.&rdquo; The word <em>eternity</em> is used two times in this verse. The first use of <em>eternity</em> is a reference to eternity past, and the second use of <em>eternity</em> is a reference to eternity future. From man&rsquo;s perspective, there is the past and there is the future, but from God&rsquo;s perspective, there is only eternity. Therefore, He is God in eternity, He is God from eternity to eternity, and He is God from eternity past without beginning to eternity future without ending. Hence, God is eternal; He is without beginning or ending. God can be compared to a circle that does not have a starting point or an ending point.</p>
<p>One of God&rsquo;s names is Jehovah. <em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;I am who I am&rdquo; (Exo. 3:14). This indicates that God is self-existing and ever-existing. He is without beginning and without ending, and He exists from eternity to eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF GOD BEING UNCREATED</h2>
<p>Since God is without beginning and without ending, existing from eternity to eternity, His life must also be without beginning and without ending. A life that is without beginning and without ending must be an uncreated life. Any life that has a beginning and an ending is a created life. The life of God is uncreated because His life is without beginning and without ending. Therefore, the Bible refers to the life of God as eternal life. God is eternal, so His life is also eternal. Since His life is eternal, it is also uncreated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE</h2>
<p>God is eternal, and He is also triune. Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; In Hebrew the word <em>God</em> in this verse is plural. Furthermore, in this verse God refers to Himself as &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; This shows that God is triune. There are many other places in the Bible where God refers to Himself as &ldquo;We&rdquo; or &ldquo;Us&rdquo; (3:22; 11:7; Isa. 6:8; John 17:21-22). This proves that God is triune. This does not mean that there are three Gods. There is only one God (Isa. 45:5; 1 Cor. 8:4). From eternity past to eternity future there is only one God. Although God is one, He is also the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Hence, He is triune. He is one yet three, and He is three yet one. He is the Triune God.</p>
<p>This is not easy for us to grasp. Let us use water as an illustration. Water vapor is in the air. When water vapor cools down, it condenses into water. If water is cooled down further, it turns into ice. Vapor, water, and ice are actually one thing. Water vapor is abstract, not visible. When vapor turns into water, it is visible but not very concrete. When water turns into ice, it can be touched and held because it is solid and concrete. This illustration is inadequate, but it can help us a little more in our understanding of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is God Himself, the Son is the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit is the Holy Spirit. The Father, Son, and Spirit are not three separate persons. In terms of the aforementioned illustration, the Father can be likened to vapor, the Son can be likened to water, and the Holy Spirit can be likened to ice. God the Father is hidden; He cannot be seen or touched by man (1 Tim. 1:17). Hence, He is abstract, just like vapor in the air. One day God became a man (John 1:14). God the Son is the expression of the Father (v. 18; 14:9). The Father is in the Son (v. 10). Just as a son comes out of his father, the Son came out of the Father (8:42). Just as a son has the life of his father, the Son has the life of God the Father (5:26). Hence, when we see the Son, we know the Father. Without the Son there is no way for the Father to be manifested. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (1:18). He who has seen the Son has seen the Father (14:9). The Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance; hence, the Son is God manifested (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15). God hidden is the Father; God manifested is the Son. The Father is the source of the Son, and the Son is the manifestation of the Father. Just as the Son is the declaration of the Father, the Spirit is the declaration of the Son (John 15:26; 16:14-15). Just as God the Father is manifested in the Son, so the Son is realized and contacted as the Spirit. The Father came to dwell among men as the Son, and the Son enters into man as the Spirit. Without the Spirit, God can only dwell among men and be seen by men as the Son, but He cannot enter into man in order to be contacted or experienced by man. God is not only the Son; He is also the Spirit. Hence, He can enter into man to be contacted by man. The Father is God hidden, the Son is God manifested, and the Spirit is God entering into man. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the Triune God from eternity to eternity. As the Father, God is hidden; as the Son, God is manifested; and as the Spirit, God can dwell in man. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit. God is uniquely one, but He is also triune.</p><h2 class="head1">CREATION BEING ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>In order to fulfill His plan, the Triune God created all things. His creation of all things was according to His plan. Concerning creation, Revelation 4:11 says, &ldquo;Because of Your will they were, and were created.&rdquo; In Greek the phrase <em>because of</em> also means &ldquo;through.&rdquo; All things were not created by chance, accidentally, or haphazardly. Rather, they were created through God&rsquo;s will, according to His plan. God in His plan determined that He would fulfill His purpose through all things; therefore, He created all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CREATION BEING TO GAIN MAN</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan is to gain some people to be the brothers of Christ. Hence, man was the goal of creation. God created all things in order to gain man. Before creating man, God created the heavens, the earth, and all things in them. He prepared the heavens, the earth, and all things for man. The things on the earth are for man to enjoy, and even the angels, as ministering spirits, are sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation (Heb. 1:14).</p>
<p>Many people envy angels, but they do not know that man is higher than the angels. God did not determine to fulfill His purpose with angels. God did not determine that angels would receive the sonship to be brothers of Christ. Rather, He determined that angels would be messengers, not sons with His life. God determined to give the sonship to man. God wants to fulfill His purpose through man. He wants man to have His life and become the many brothers of Christ.</p>
<p>Man is the goal of creation because God&rsquo;s purpose is with man. Everything that God created is for man. Although the angels dwell in the heavens, they exist for man. Some of the things in the heavens and on earth are for man to enjoy, some things are for man to appreciate, and other things are for man to have dominion over. All things were created and prepared for man&rsquo;s existence so that man could be gained by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan and fulfill His purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CREATION BEING IN THE ORDER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>God created all things in the order of life. He created non-living things before He created the living things. When He created living things, He created lower forms of life before creating higher forms of life. He first created life without consciousness, that is, the plant life, such as grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees (Gen. 1:11). Unlike soil and rocks, which are lifeless, plants have life, but the plant life does not have consciousness. Hence, the plant life is the lowest form of life. After the plant life God created the animal life, and He again started with the lower forms of animal life. He first created fish and birds (vv. 20-21). These animals have consciousness, but this consciousness is not very subjective. Then God created animals with a higher level of life, such as cattle (vv. 24-25). These life forms are higher than plants, fish, and birds because they have more of a subjective consciousness, but they are not the highest form of created life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMAN LIFE BEING THE HIGHEST CREATED LIFE</h2>
<p>After creating the animal life, God created man (vv. 26-27). God created man last. Man is the highest form of created life. Not only does the human life have consciousness, but this consciousness is very subjective. The consciousness of the human life surpasses that of the animal life. In relation to emotions, intelligence, and skill, the human life surpasses every other form of life. Therefore, man can have dominion over every creature (v. 26).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN IN HIS IMAGE AND<br />
ACCORDING TO HIS LIKENESS</h2>
<p>God did not only create man with the highest form of created life; He also created man in His image and according to His likeness (v. 26). Man is the only creature that looks like God, because only man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to His likeness. Hence, man is the highest creature created by God. God prepared man as a vessel for His plan (Rom. 9:23). In His plan God determined that we would have His life to be the many brothers of Christ; hence, God made man in His image and likeness.</p>
<p>Image refers to our mind, emotion, and will. Our mind, emotion, and will, our so-called metaphysical person, are created in God&rsquo;s image. Hence, our thoughts, feelings, intentions, and preferences are similar to God&rsquo;s. Man is higher than every other creature because he was made in God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Likeness refers to outward form. Our body, our outward form, was created according to God&rsquo;s likeness. We are God&rsquo;s likeness. In the Old Testament, God appeared to people in man&rsquo;s likeness before He became flesh (Gen. 18:1-8; Judg. 13:3-21). Man was created according to God&rsquo;s likeness; therefore, man has God&rsquo;s likeness.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s bodily form is more beautiful than the form of other creatures. Flowers, trees, beasts, and cattle are beautiful, but they are inferior to man. Man is beautiful because he resembles God and thus surpasses all other creatures. Man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness; therefore, he can represent God with His dominion over all creation.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN BEING CREATED WITH THREE PARTS&mdash;<br />
SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</h2>
<p>God created man with three parts&mdash;a spirit, a soul, and a body. God formed man&rsquo;s body from the dust of the ground, and then He breathed into man&rsquo;s body the breath of life, and man became a living soul. The breath of life became the human spirit. When the human spirit was combined with the human body, the soul was produced (Gen. 2:7). Man has a visible body, and within man there is an invisible spirit. Between the visible body and the invisible spirit is the soul. Man is composed of three parts&mdash;a spirit, a soul, and a body.</p>
<p>With our body we contact things in the physical realm, and with our spirit we contact things in the spiritual realm. With our soul, which is between our body and our spirit, we contact things in the psychological realm. Our body uses various senses and faculties to contact physical things. Our spirit uses the functions of the conscience, intuition, and fellowship to contact divine and spiritual things. Our soul uses our mind, emotion, and will to contact things in the psychological realm. Our mind is our thinking organ with which we think and consider. Our will is our decision-making organ with which we plan, judge, decide, and choose. With our emotions we feel delight, anger, sorrow, joy, love, hate, excitement, or depression. Our soul is composed of these three parts: mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to know our body or our soul, but it is difficult for us to understand our human spirit. Our spirit is the innermost part of our being, and it is the organ with which we contact God, know Him, and fellowship with Him. Only our spirit is able to know God and fellowship with Him. Neither our body nor our soul can contact God. Only our spirit can contact and know God. The inward feeling of needing God, the sense and realization of God in the depth of our being, and the condemnation and approval of our conscience are functions of our spirit.</p>
<p>Man is the highest creature, not only because the human life is the highest created life or because man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness, but also because man has a spirit in addition to a soul and a body. Other creatures have only a soul; they do not have a spirit, so they cannot understand or fellowship with God. Among all the creatures on earth, only man was created with a spirit, because God in His plan determined that only man would have His life. Hence, we can become the many brothers of Christ. God created us with a spirit so that we can contact Him and receive His life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN GOOD AND UPRIGHT</h2>
<p>Ecclesiastes 7:29 says that God made man upright. When man was formed by God, man was upright, good, and clean, not crooked, evil, or filthy. Man did not have sin, corruption, or defects. Thus, after creating man, God referred to the creation of man as being very good (Gen. 1:31). Because God is good and upright, He prepared a good and upright vessel to contain His holy life; He did not prepare an evil or crooked vessel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING CREATED LIFE</h2>
<p>Although man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness and was created good and upright, the human life is only a created life; it is not like the uncreated life of God. The human life was created and has a beginning and an ending, but God&rsquo;s life is uncreated and does not have a beginning or an ending. God&rsquo;s life is from eternity to eternity. No matter how high the human life may be, it is still inferior to God&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s life is eternal, but man&rsquo;s life is finite. God&rsquo;s life is divine and glorious, but man&rsquo;s life at its best can only be clean and sinless, not divine or glorious. Man was not created with God&rsquo;s divine, glorious nature. The human life is outside of God and has nothing to do with God. Although man has God&rsquo;s image and His likeness, unregenerated man does not have God&rsquo;s life in his deepest part. Although man has a spirit, the created human spirit does not have God&rsquo;s life in it. This spirit enables man to know God and to fellowship with God, but it does not have God&rsquo;s life or God&rsquo;s nature. Man is merely a creature created by God; the created man does not possess the uncreated life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING THE CENTER OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>In the universe God&rsquo;s attention is focused on the earth, and the center of the earth was the garden of Eden. After God created man, He put man in the garden of Eden (2:8). This shows that God&rsquo;s attention is focused on man. Man is the center of the universe. Man is God&rsquo;s treasure. The earth is important to God because man is on the earth. God wants man, God loves man, and man is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart, because God has determined to gain man so that He can carry out His heart&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His purpose through man. God wants man to have His life and nature and thus be like Him. Man does not have God&rsquo;s life and nature, but he has God&rsquo;s image and likeness. Man is a creature, but he has a spirit with which he can know God and fellowship with God. Man does not have God&rsquo;s life, but with his spirit he can receive God&rsquo;s life. Man is a vessel to contain God&rsquo;s life. Of all the creatures on earth, only man has the image and likeness of God, and only man has a spirit to receive God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, God&rsquo;s attention is focused on man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD GIVING MAN A WILL<br />
IN ORDER TO CHOOSE HIS PURPOSE</h2>
<p>God created us so that we would have His life and become the many brothers of Christ. God wants man to choose this purpose. God created man in His image and according to His likeness, and He created man with a spirit, but He did not put His life into man. Rather, He made man with a will so that man might choose to receive God&rsquo;s life. God wants man to exercise his will to cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, after creating man, God put man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden (vv. 8-9). God&rsquo;s intention was for man to choose the tree of life in order to receive life. The tree of life signifies God&rsquo;s eternal life (3:22). God put man in front of the tree of life so that man might choose to receive the life of the tree of life, that is, to receive the life of God.</p>
<p>God put the tree of the knowledge of good and evil next to the tree of life. Many people think that if the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had not been next to the tree of life, there would not have been a problem. However, because God is so great, He gave man a will to choose between the two trees. If God had to force man to take of the tree of life, He would not be great. But because He is so great, He gave man the ability to choose. God honors man by giving man this capacity.</p>
<p>Some people think that if God had put His life into man when he was created, there would not have been any problems. But this is not what God did. God would rather give man the ability to choose. If God had done everything to accomplish His will, His wisdom would not have been manifested. God is not afraid of obstacles or troubles. In order to manifest His wisdom, He gave man the ability to choose to receive His life.</p>
<p>God created all things so that man could receive His life. But man still did not have God&rsquo;s life after the heavens, the earth, and all things were created. Although man had God&rsquo;s image and likeness, had a human spirit, and was good and upright, he did not have God&rsquo;s life. The man whom God created was humanly complete, but he lacked the life of God; he was devoid of God&rsquo;s purpose. God did everything for man, but He did not put His life into man. How then did the life of God enter into man? The Bible reveals that God lets man choose to receive His life.</p>
<p>Hence, the highest point of creation was merely the culmination of God&rsquo;s preparation of the material needed for His purpose. The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan was for man to receive His life. Creation only prepared man as a vessel to receive God&rsquo;s life, but God will not put His life into man without man&rsquo;s consent. Creation merely prepared man to receive God&rsquo;s life; it did not give God&rsquo;s life to man. After man was created, he had to exercise his will to receive the life of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:15; Ezek. 28:12-17; Isa. 14:12-15; Gen. 2:16-17; 3:1-7, 22-24; Rom. 5:12-19; 1 Cor. 15:22</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw God&rsquo;s plan and creation. In this chapter we will consider man&rsquo;s fall. In order to understand man&rsquo;s fall, we must first consider Satan, who tempted man and caused man to fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXISTENCE OF SATAN</h2>
<p>After creating man, God put Adam in the garden of Eden &ldquo;to work it and to keep it&rdquo; (Gen. 2:15). God commanded Adam not only to work the garden but also to keep it. In Hebrew the word <em>keep</em> means &ldquo;to guard.&rdquo; The fact that God commanded Adam to guard the garden of Eden shows that there was someone in the universe seeking to destroy God&rsquo;s creation. If there were no one seeking to destroy God&rsquo;s creation, God would not have commanded Adam to guard the garden. Thus, God commanded Adam to guard the garden because Satan was seeking to destroy God&rsquo;s creation. Before man was created, Satan was in conflict with God and intent upon destroying God&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that Satan was in conflict with God before man was created and before God restored the heavens and the earth (1:1-2; Ezek. 28:12-17). Satan rebelled against God and became the adversary of God. After God restored all things, He commanded Adam to guard the garden because Satan, as God&rsquo;s enemy, was seeking to damage His restored creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</h2>
<p>According to Ezekiel 28, Satan was initially the anointed cherub; however, he sinned and rebelled against God. This occurred in the world that existed before man was created. Verses 13 through 16 of chapter 28 say, &ldquo;You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering...The workmanship of your tambourines and your pipes was prepared with you on the day that you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covered the Ark; indeed I set you, so that you were upon the holy mountain of God...You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God.&rdquo; Satan was initially the anointed cherub. As the anointed cherub, he was associated with God&rsquo;s glory (v. 14; 9:3), and he was very close to God (1 Sam. 4:4). Satan was in the garden of God and upon the holy mountain of God; thus, he was very close to God (Ezek. 28:13-14). Satan was not only a cherub for God&rsquo;s glory and very close to God; he also sealed up perfection, was full of wisdom, and was perfect in beauty (v. 12). Judging from the fact that the workmanship of tambourines and pipes was prepared with him on the day that he was created (v. 13), he must have been like a great king (cf. Dan. 3:5). He was &ldquo;the anointed cherub who covered the Ark&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:14). He was anointed to cover the Ark, that is, to guard and protect the interest of God.</p>
<p>Other portions in the Bible show that the world now is under Satan&rsquo;s rule (Luke 4:5-6; Eph. 2:2; John 12:31). Satan must have been a ruler among the angels (Ezek. 28:13-14), an archangel with a high position (cf. Jude 9). Even though he was perfect in his ways, he sinned against God because his heart was lifted up by his beauty (Ezek. 28:15, 17-18). Isaiah 14:13-14 reveals that Satan&rsquo;s sin was to uplift himself to be equal to God. Satan said in his heart, &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High.&rdquo; Initially, he was for God&rsquo;s glory, but he tried to usurp God&rsquo;s glory. Satan was anointed to protect God&rsquo;s interest, but he tried to usurp God&rsquo;s place. Thus, he became God&rsquo;s adversary. The Hebrew word for <em>Satan</em> means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESTRUCTION OF SATAN</h2>
<p>After this anointed cherub rebelled against God and became Satan, God condemned him and cast him out from His holy mountain (Ezek. 28:16). Although Satan was condemned and cast out from God&rsquo;s presence, the Bible reveals that God does not want to destroy Satan directly. God wants to deal with and destroy Satan through man. Although Satan was cast out from God&rsquo;s presence, God allows him to exist while He gains man, who will destroy him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TREE<br />
OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2>
<p>God put Adam in front of the tree of life, which signifies the life of God, so that he would contact the tree of life in order to receive God&rsquo;s life. God wants to give us His life, but Satan wants to give us death. This is the significance of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil being next to the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan. Satan has the might of death (Heb. 2:14); therefore, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil brings death to man. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil reveals that in the universe there is not only God but also Satan. God gives life to man, but Satan gives death to man. It is possible for man to contact God and receive life, and it is also possible for man to contact Satan and receive death. When man contacts the tree of life, he contacts God, and the issue is life. When man contacts the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he contacts Satan, and the issue is death.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>From man&rsquo;s perspective, the earth is the center of the universe, and the garden of Eden is the center of the earth. The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were at the center of the garden. Hence, from the human perspective, these two trees are the center of the universe. When God put Adam in front of these two trees, man&rsquo;s future depended on how he dealt with these two trees. These two trees are at the center of the universe, and our relationship to these two trees is the central issue of the universe.</p>
<p>By standing in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam was actually standing in front of God and Satan. The garden of Eden had three main features: the tree of life, which signifies God; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan; and Adam, who represents man. God, Satan, and man are the three main characters in the universe. God and Satan want to gain man. Whereas God wants to gain man in order to fulfill His purpose, Satan wants to gain man in order to fulfill his evil intention. Therefore, the central issue of the universe is whether man will stand on God&rsquo;s side in order to be gained by God or on Satan&rsquo;s side in order to be gained by Satan. If we stand on God&rsquo;s side and are gained by Him, we will fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. However, if we stand on Satan&rsquo;s side and are gained by him, we will serve Satan&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FREEDOM OF MAN</h2>
<p>Although God wants us to stand on His side and to be gained by Him, He will not force us to choose Him, and although God does not want us to stand on Satan&rsquo;s side or to be gained by Satan, He will not stop us from choosing Satan. God did not compel Adam to contact the tree of life, nor did He stop Adam from contacting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God did not make the tree of life more accessible to Adam than the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Rather, God put Adam in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and gave him the freedom to choose. God is the Creator, but He let Adam choose between Himself and Satan. This shows God&rsquo;s greatness. God is so great that He will not force us to stand on His side. If we prefer God, we can freely choose Him, but if we prefer Satan, we are free to choose God&rsquo;s adversary. God gives us the freedom to choose. He will never force us to choose His way.</p>
<p>God did not eliminate Satan from the universe in order to limit Adam&rsquo;s choice to Himself, and He did not block the way to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, leaving only the tree of life for Adam to contact. Rather, God placed Adam before both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Both God, as the tree of life, and Satan, as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, were before Adam. Hence, he could choose between the tree of life, signifying God, or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, signifying Satan. If Adam had chosen God, he would have received life, but he chose Satan and received death. God gave Adam the freedom to choose and to decide according to his own will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PROHIBITION AND WARNING</h2>
<p>Although God did not stop Adam from contacting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, He did command him to not eat of its fruit. Genesis 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; Although God did not command Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of life, He warned him to not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life occupies a central place in God&rsquo;s heart, but He put the tree of life among all the other trees and said to Adam, &ldquo;You may eat freely&rdquo; (v. 16). This shows His greatness. God warned Adam to not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by saying that in the day that he ate of it he would surely die (v. 17). Knowing the consequences of eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God warned Adam. God&rsquo;s prohibition was a warning to Adam to not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God commanded Adam to &ldquo;guard&rdquo; the garden, and He also warned Adam concerning the existence of the evil one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S TEMPTATION</h2>
<p>Satan knew that God&rsquo;s desire, pleasure, and purpose involved man and that the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s plan was delegated to man. Thus, if God gained man, He would be able to carry out His plan through man. Satan also knew that God intended to deal with him through man. Thus, if Satan could gain man, he would be able to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan. Satan knew that God intended for man to eat of the tree of life; therefore, before man could be gained by God, Satan came in to corrupt and usurp man. Before man could contact the tree of life and enter into a relationship with God, Satan tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and to enter into a relationship with him instead. Satan, as God&rsquo;s adversary, intended to disrupt God&rsquo;s plan. Satan knew that if he could corrupt and usurp man, he would be able to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan. Satan&rsquo;s action to corrupt and usurp man was malicious in its intention.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God commanded man to guard the garden of Eden, and on the other hand, He warned man of the existence of the evil one and of his evil desire to corrupt and kill man (vv. 15-17). It is important to consider how the evil one corrupted and usurped man.</p><h2 class="head2">As a Serpent</h2>
<p>The evil one is very crafty. He concealed himself as a serpent (3:1). This serpent was not only subtle but also beautiful; it was attractive to man. Satan drew man&rsquo;s attention to himself through the subtle and beautiful serpent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Approaching the Woman</h2>
<p>When Satan usurped man, he not only appeared as a serpent, but he also approached the woman. Satan is very subtle and clever. He knew that it was easier to tempt the woman than the man, so he approached Eve, not Adam (vv. 1-2). Women are more easily deceived because they are the weaker vessel (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, when Satan wanted to deceive man, he approached the woman instead of the man. Because Satan took this way, he was able to deceive man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Causing Man to Doubt God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>God said to man, &ldquo;Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:16-17). When Satan asked the woman, &ldquo;Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?&rdquo; (3:1), his words caused man to doubt God&rsquo;s word. The first step in Satan&rsquo;s work is to cause us to doubt God and question God&rsquo;s word. Dr. Haldeman has said that when the serpent in the garden inquired, &ldquo;Did God really say?&rdquo; its posture was in the form of a question mark, with the head raised and the body bent. As long as Satan can put such a question into us, he will be able to deceive us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deceiving Man with Lies</h2>
<p>God said, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (2:17). Satan, however, said, &ldquo;You shall not surely die!&rdquo; (3:4). This was a lie to deceive man. Furthermore, he told the woman that God commanded man not to eat of the tree, because &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil&rdquo; (v. 5). Here again Satan was crafty with his words in order to deceive man. This is the reason that the Bible speaks of the serpent deceiving Eve by his craftiness (2 Cor. 11:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Infusing His Evil Thoughts into Man</h2>
<p>In Genesis 3:5 Satan said to Eve, &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo; With these words the evil one not only slandered God and caused Eve to be suspicious toward God; he also injected his pride into her so that she wanted to be equal to God. Satan rebelled against God because he wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God. In the garden he injected the same evil thought into Eve through his words so that man would join him in his rebellion against God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Tempting Man to Contact<br />
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s purpose in tempting man was to entice man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that the life of that tree would enter into man. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan, and the life of this tree signifies the life of Satan. By tempting man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan was actually tempting man to contact himself. He wanted to put the life of this tree into man. His evil intention was to inject his evil, contradictory, and rebellious life into man. God desired that man would contact the tree of life in order to receive His life and be joined with Him, thus enabling God to gain man in order to fulfill His plan and destroy Satan. Satan wanted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in order to receive his life and enter into an illicit union with him so that he could usurp man, fulfill his evil intention, and frustrate God&rsquo;s plan. Before Adam was able to contact the tree of life, Satan tempted him to contact the tree of knowledge and receive the life of Satan, thus fulfilling Satan&rsquo;s evil intention.</p>
<p>By usurping and corrupting the man whom God had created for His plan, Satan frustrated God&rsquo;s plan. Usurping and corrupting Adam was the best way for Satan to enter into man, gain man, and have an illicit union with man. Satan tempted Adam to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that he might enter into man, gain man, and have an illicit union with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>Man fell because he could not resist the temptation of the evil one. Although God commanded man to guard the garden, he failed and allowed God&rsquo;s enemy to sneak in. Although God had warned man, he fell because he accepted the suggestion of the father of lies and was deceived (John 8:44). Man&rsquo;s fall involved several steps.</p><h2 class="head2">The Woman Assuming the Headship</h2>
<p>When the subtle one went to the woman, she fell into his trap because she assumed the headship in dealing with him (Gen. 3:2-3, 6). The first step in man&rsquo;s fall was the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship. This is a terrible thing. Even before the woman ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she fell into the stratagem of the evil one by assuming the headship over the man. This was her mistake. As a result, she was deceived. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Talking with Satan</h2>
<p>The second step in man&rsquo;s fall was to talk with Satan. The best way to handle Satan&rsquo;s questions is to ignore them. If we respond to his questions, we will surely be fooled. Satan asks questions in order to tempt us to talk with him. Eve was deceived by the serpent because she answered his question and talked with him (Gen. 3:2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Satan&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>As a result of talking with the serpent, Eve received his word. A person&rsquo;s words represent not only his intention but also his life and person. The Lord&rsquo;s words are His life, and God&rsquo;s word is God (John 6:63; 1:1). By receiving Satan&rsquo;s word, Eve received not only his intention but also his life and person. When we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, we receive the Lord&rsquo;s life and are joined to the Lord. Likewise, when we receive Satan&rsquo;s word, we receive his life and are joined to him. Satan entered into man even before man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan entered into man when Eve received his word. As soon as Eve received Satan&rsquo;s word, his life entered into man, and man was illicitly united with Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Controlled by Satan&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>After entering into Eve, Satan&rsquo;s word took control of her and caused her to look at and desire the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:6). Eve received Satan&rsquo;s word into her mind. This word controlled her, made her look at the tree, and caused her heart to delight in the tree. This put a desire within her to gain the knowledge of good and evil in order to be just like God. As a result, lust and pride rose up in her being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eating the Fruit of the Tree<br />
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>When Eve was controlled by the serpent&rsquo;s word to look at the tree of knowledge with her eyes and to desire it in her heart, she took its fruit with her hand and ate it (v. 6). Those who take in Satan&rsquo;s word will be controlled by his word and will fulfill his proposals. Eve was not an exception. She took in Satan&rsquo;s word and was controlled by his word. According to his proposal, she ate the fruit that God had commanded man not to eat.</p>
<p>Eve ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge and also gave it to her husband to eat (v. 6). This was the purpose of the evil one. Satan tempted Eve to eat the fruit of the tree so that her husband would eat the fruit. It was hard for Satan to deceive the man, but it was easier for him to gain man through the woman. Women are often the means through which men sin. When a wife sins, she often causes her husband to commit the same sin. Satan leads men into sin through women.</p>
<p>When Adam followed his wife to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he sinned and fell. Thus, Satan&rsquo;s stratagem to deceive and usurp man was successful. As a result, man was one with Satan and entered into an illicit relationship and union with him. The man who was appointed by God to guard the garden of Eden was eventually stolen by God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSEQUENCES OF MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s sin and fall have consequences. The consequences of man&rsquo;s fall are serious, tragic, and dreadful. The Bible reveals at least five consequences of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Record of Sin</h2>
<p>Although God commanded man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man disobeyed God&rsquo;s command. As a result, man became unlawful before God. Man was condemned by God because he had committed a sinful deed, and he now had a record of sin (Rom. 5:16, 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Nature of Sin</h2>
<p>When man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he violated God&rsquo;s command, and Satan and his life entered into man.</p>
<p>Man used his mind, emotion, and will to receive Satan&rsquo;s word; hence, Satan&rsquo;s word entered into every part of man&rsquo;s soul. Words represent the intentions of a speaker and also the speaker&rsquo;s life and person. When man received Satan&rsquo;s word, man received Satan&rsquo;s intention, life, and person. From that time, the three parts of man&rsquo;s soul have been defiled by Satan.</p>
<p>When man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the life of that tree entered into man&rsquo;s body. The life of the tree of knowledge signifies the life of Satan; hence, the life of Satan entered into man&rsquo;s body. This life became the &ldquo;sin&rdquo; that dwells in man (7:17, 20). This sin is also called &ldquo;the evil&rdquo; (v. 21), and it is the law of sin in our members (v. 23).</p>
<p>To eat is to receive something into our being. When Adam sinned, he not only did something unlawful; he also took something evil into his being. When he ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the life of Satan entered into him. The most critical point in man&rsquo;s fall is that Satan&rsquo;s evil life entered into man.</p>
<p>Man received this evil life in such a way that it became his own element. By eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man was joined to this life. Thus, Satan and man were united. When man fell, Satan entered into man and was joined with man. As a result, fallen man has Satan&rsquo;s life, and Satan is in man.</p>
<p>Man was created pure and clean. After man fell, he was no longer pure and clean. Instead, he was defiled by Satan because he had Satan&rsquo;s life. As a result, man&rsquo;s body was transmuted, mixed, and filthy.</p>
<p>On the one hand, when man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he violated God&rsquo;s law and established a record of sin. This was outward. On the other hand, when man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature entered into man. As a result, man has a sinful nature and has been constituted a sinner (5:19). This is inward. With regard to God&rsquo;s law, man has a record of sin and thus stands condemned before God. With regard to man&rsquo;s condition, man possesses the nature of sin and has the tendency to sin. Hence, man commits sinful deeds outwardly and has a sinful life and nature inwardly. There is an objective consequence to man&rsquo;s fall and also a subjective consequence. Objectively, man is under God&rsquo;s condemnation as a result of his sinful act. Subjectively, man continues to sin as a result of his sinful life and nature.</p>
<p>For example, I may tell a brother not to pour black ink into a cup of plain water. But if, out of curiosity, he pours the ink into the water, he will violate my command. However, by pouring black ink into a cup of plain water, he also will change the plain water into black water. This example can be applied to man. First, man violated God&rsquo;s command, and second, something &ldquo;black&rdquo;&mdash;Satan&rsquo;s sinful life&mdash;was added into his pure and clean being, transmuting his nature from white to black.</p>
<p>God created man as a clean vessel for His life, but before God could put His holy life into this clean vessel, man was tempted by Satan and received Satan&rsquo;s filthy life. As a result, man not only offended God outwardly but also became corrupted inwardly.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s purpose in tempting man to sin was not only to make man sin against God outwardly but also to corrupt and defile man inwardly. By causing man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan injected his sinful, filthy life into man. This sinful, filthy life includes all the dark elements that are against God. This can be likened to poison being added to a cup of clean, pure water before vitamins can be added. God created man in a pure condition so that He could mingle His life with man. But before God could be mingled with man, His enemy injected his poisonous life into man. Man was tempted and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Man&rsquo;s inward, subjective problem is as serious as his outward, objective problem. The inward, subjective consequence is as serious as his outward, objective consequence.</p>
<p>Before the fall man had only the human life, but after the fall his human life was mixed with Satan&rsquo;s life. People commit sinful acts, such as fornicating, gambling, smoking, hating, murdering, coveting, and stealing, because our human life is mixed with Satan&rsquo;s life, which is &ldquo;the sin&rdquo; within us. These sinful acts are not committed merely by our human life. These sinful deeds are the result of indwelling sin; Satan&rsquo;s life stirs, directs, and compels people to commit sin (7:17, 20). The consequence of man&rsquo;s fall is that Satan&rsquo;s evil life is now in us as indwelling sin.</p><h2 class="head2">Issuing in Death</h2>
<p>God commanded man, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). The result of eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is that man has a record of sin before God, a nature of sin, and death (Rom. 5:15).</p>
<p>The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. This is seen first with the deadening of man&rsquo;s spirit, then the death of man&rsquo;s body, then the suffering of man&rsquo;s soul in Hades, and finally the second death of man&rsquo;s spirit, soul, and body (Rev. 20:14; 21:8). When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was immediately deadened toward God (Eph. 2:1), and later his body also died (Gen. 5:5). Furthermore, if a person is not saved, his soul will be tormented in Hades after he dies (Luke 16:23), and his whole being will suffer the second death in the future.</p>
<p>Before man fell, his spirit was not deadened, and he had the capacity to fellowship with God and understand the things of God. After man fell, his spirit was deadened and lost its function of fellowshipping with God and of understanding the things of God. As soon as sin entered into man, his spirit was deadened even though his body was still alive. Outwardly, a person may appear to be living, but inwardly he is dead (Matt. 8:22). Then in due time his body will die. If he is not saved, his soul will be tormented in Hades, and eventually his entire being will suffer the second death (Heb. 9:27; Luke 16:23; Rev. 20:14; 21:8). This is truly a serious and dreadful consequence!</p>
<p>The Bible says that the wages of sin is death and that through sin, death entered the world (Rom. 6:23; 5:12). Death follows sin. Wherever there is sin, there is death. Man has sin and therefore cannot escape death. The Bible also says, &ldquo;Sin reigned in death&rdquo; (v. 21). This means that sin causes man to die. Sin has entered into man and reigns in man. Death now reigns over man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil involves evil, death, and the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, when man ate the fruit of this tree, he received death and a knowledge of good and evil. On the one hand, his spirit was deadened and lost its function of understanding the things of God. On the other hand, his eyes were opened to know good and evil. Prior to the fall, man was able to understand the things of God even though he did not have a knowledge of good and evil. But after man fell, his spirit was deadened and lost its function of understanding the things of God. Instead, man acquired the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Initially, man lived by his spirit before God, was governed by God, and did not have the problem of good and evil. When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was deadened toward God, and he could no longer be governed by God. Instead, the knowledge of good and evil entered into man to control him. As a result, man lives by the knowledge of good and evil and is accountable to the knowledge of good and evil. Man no longer lives by his spirit, and neither is he accountable to God alone. Man lives according to good and evil instead of living according to God. Man knows about good and evil, but he is not able to understand God.</p>
<p>Even though man has acquired the knowledge of good and evil and is able to know good and evil, he cannot refuse evil and do good. The knowledge of good and evil caused man&rsquo;s spirit to die. Instead of enabling man to refuse evil and do good, sin causes man to do the evil that he does not desire to do (7:19). Before man fell, he did not know good and evil, but he still lived out good; now that man knows good and evil, he does evil instead of good because of sin. Those who know good and evil still commit many evils. The more knowledge man has concerning good and evil, the more capable he is of doing evil. The knowledge of good and evil is actually evil. The knowledge of good and evil cannot prevent man from living in evil and doing evil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cast Out of Eden</h2>
<p>As a result of the fall, man was cast out of the garden of Eden (Gen. 3:22-24). Eden is the dwelling place of God. To be cast out of Eden is to be cast out of God&rsquo;s presence. The holy and righteous God cannot allow filthy sinners to live in His presence. God created man so that man would live in His presence and fellowship with Him. As a result of man&rsquo;s sin and fall, God cast man out of the garden, His presence, and man could not fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL PARTICIPATING IN ONE MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>When Adam sinned and fell in the garden of Eden, all mankind was included. Because Adam was the first man, he represents mankind and is the head of mankind. Therefore, when Adam sinned, all mankind, including those who were living and those who were not yet born, was affected by his sin. When he sinned, all mankind, which he represented, sinned. His sin was the sin of mankind. This is the reason Romans 5:18 speaks of one offense being unto condemnation to all men.</p>
<p>Adam is the forefather of all mankind. Hence, when he sinned, all his descendants were involved in his sin (cf. Heb. 7:9-10). His sin involved all mankind. When sin entered into Adam and constituted him a sinner, sin entered into mankind and constituted all men sinners. Hence, Romans 5:19 says, &ldquo;Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners,&rdquo; and verse 12 says, &ldquo;Through one man sin entered into the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fall of Adam was the fall of mankind. We all participated in Adam&rsquo;s fall. In him we fell together with him. We fell before we were even born. We did not need to wait until we committed a sin to become sinners. We were born sinners because we sinned in Adam. In Adam we sinned, and we were constituted sinners before we were born. We were born fallen sinners.</p>
<p>A brother once said that he had been a sinner for more than forty years, because he was in his forties. He also said that he committed his first sin in Shan-hsi, because that is where he grew up. I told him that although I was only in my forties, I had been a sinner for six thousand years and that I committed my first sin in the garden of Eden. This is the truth. Nearly six thousand years ago we sinned in Adam in the garden of Eden. When Adam sinned six thousand years ago, we sinned, and when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, we sinned. Adam&rsquo;s sinful act was our sinful act because we were all in Adam.</p>
<p>Since Adam&rsquo;s fall is our fall, the consequences of his fall are also ours. As the descendants of Adam, we all participate in the five consequences of Adam&rsquo;s fall.</p><h2 class="head2">Being under Condemnation</h2>
<p>Before we were born, we were condemned (John 3:18). Our condemnation is not based on a particular sin that we committed. We were condemned in Adam even before we were born. Such a condemnation is the result of Adam&rsquo;s one offense (Rom. 5:17-18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Sinful Nature</h2>
<p>We were born sinners with a sinful nature because we were born, came out, of Adam, who had a sinful nature. Let us return to the example of ink and plain water. If I pour the black water into many small cups, the water in each cup will still be black. We do not need to pour black ink into every small cup. The large cup that contains black water can be likened to Adam, and the small cups with water can be likened to the descendants of Adam. Adam had a sinful nature, and the billions of people that came out of him have the same sinful nature. We are just like Adam. We are exactly the same as he, because we came out of him. Hence, no person in the world is without sin. Every person has the sinful nature. No one is without sin; no one is pure. We were born sinners with a sinful nature; hence, we are capable of sinning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Dead</h2>
<p>We were born dead, because our spirit was deadened. Although we were born with a human spirit, it was deadened. It lost its function, so we could not understand the things of God or fellowship with Him. For example, the ears of a deaf person have lost their function and cannot hear sounds, and the eyes of a blind person have lost their function and cannot see colors. We could not understand the things of God or know God, because our spirit was deadened. When our spirit was deadened, our body also lost its sustaining power, and as a result, our body gradually becomes weak, old, and sick and eventually dies. If a person who is not saved dies, his soul will be tormented in Hades. Eventually, his entire being will suffer the second death. Strictly speaking, after we were born, we have been dying every day, not living. Through Adam&rsquo;s fall we are in the place of death. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;By the offense of the one the many died,&rdquo; &ldquo;by the offense of the one, death reigned,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in Adam all die&rdquo; (vv. 15, 17; 1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>We were born with the knowledge of good and evil. Regardless of whether a person is civilized or a barbarian, he is born with the knowledge of good and evil and the ability to discern right from wrong. This knowledge proves that all mankind has participated in Adam&rsquo;s fall and in the consequences of Adam&rsquo;s fall. The knowledge of good and evil entered into mankind through Adam&rsquo;s fall. Adam passed down to his descendants not only sin and death but also the knowledge of good and evil. The knowledge of good and evil causes man&rsquo;s spirit to be independent from God. People are controlled by the knowledge of good and evil instead of by God. They are accountable to the knowledge of good and evil instead of to God. They seem to know good and evil but not God. People pay attention to good and evil and to right and wrong, but they do not have the power to refuse evil or to do good, nor do they pay attention to God. As a result, they commit sins and do evil. People live by the knowledge of good and evil because they are fallen.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Cast Out from God&rsquo;s Presence</h2>
<p>We were born far from God (Eph. 2:12-13). We were born after Adam was cast out of the garden of Eden, and we were born outside of the garden of Eden. When Adam was cast out of the garden of Eden, his descendants, who were included in him, were also cast out of the garden of Eden. None of Adam&rsquo;s descendants were born in the garden of Eden. Before we were born, we were already cast out of Eden, out of God&rsquo;s presence. We were born outside of God&rsquo;s presence and far from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO THE TREE OF LIFE BEING CLOSED</h2>
<p>After Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God closed the way to the tree of life. Genesis 3:22 says, &ldquo;Lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever.&rdquo; This indicates that Adam had not yet eaten the fruit of the tree of life and that God did not want fallen man with his evil nature to eat the fruit of the tree of life. God&rsquo;s original intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life in order to gain the eternal life of God, but man received Satan&rsquo;s evil life and nature by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, God did not want man to eat the fruit of the tree of life without dealing with his evil nature. If man ate of the tree of life, he would live forever with this evil nature. Closing the way to the tree of life was not an ill intent on God&rsquo;s part; it was a good intention toward man until He could deal with man&rsquo;s evil nature through the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>God placed &ldquo;the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life&rdquo; (v. 24). The cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; 10:4; Heb. 9:5), and the flame signifies God&rsquo;s holiness. God must burn anything that does not match His holy nature (Deut. 4:24; 9:3; Heb. 12:29). The sword indicates God&rsquo;s righteousness. God cannot pardon anything that does not match His righteousness (Lam. 3:42-43; Rom. 2:5; 2 Thes. 1:5-6; Rev. 19:2, 11). After man sinned, the way to the tree of life was closed due to God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. God&rsquo;s intention was for man to contact the tree of life and receive the life of God, but because of his sin, man violated God&rsquo;s righteousness, contradicted God&rsquo;s holiness, and fell short of God&rsquo;s glory (Rom. 3:23). Therefore, God used His righteousness, holiness, and glory to close the way to the tree of life, thus preventing man from receiving His righteous, holy, and glorious life. In order for the way to the tree of life to be opened, God&rsquo;s righteousness must be satisfied, His holiness must be matched, and His glory must be manifested. The way to the tree of life remained closed until the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption. When the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, He satisfied God&rsquo;s righteousness, matched God&rsquo;s holiness, and manifested God&rsquo;s glory. This opened the way to the tree of life.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God. Therefore, when the way to the tree of life was closed, the way to God was closed. Although God desired to contact man, His righteousness, holiness, and glory prevented sinful man from contacting Him. This was clearly portrayed when the children of Israel received God&rsquo;s law at Mount Sinai. The children of Israel were in fear of contacting God at Mount Sinai because of His righteousness, holiness, and glory (Exo. 19:20-24). The way that leads to the righteous, holy, and glorious God was closed until the Lord Jesus came and shed His blood to accomplish redemption. Only then was a way opened for man to approach God (Heb. 10:19-20; Matt. 27:50-51).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PROPHECIES AND TYPES OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:10-12, 18-20; Rev. 13:8; Rom. 1:2; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; Luke 24:44-46; Heb. 8:5; 10:1; Col. 2:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to work His life into man so that man may have the sonship and be conformed to the image of the Son of God, making His Son the Firstborn among many brothers (Eph. 1:5; Rom. 8:29). Both God&rsquo;s eternal plan and His creation in time are for the purpose of gaining man and working His life into man to conform man to the image of His Son to become His many brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF THE FALL OF MAN</h2>
<p>After man was created, however, Satan seduced man to sin, and before God could work His life into man, he fell. Satan injected his defiling, sinful, and evil life into man. Hence, the clean and pure man whom God had created for His plan was defiled and mixed with sin and death. This posed a problem for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s plan. Once man had sinned and was defiled by sin and death, the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory could not permit man to contact God&rsquo;s life (Gen. 3:24). In order to accomplish His eternal purpose of creating man so that man would receive His life, God&rsquo;s requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory had to be satisfied by taking away man&rsquo;s sin and dealing with the element of death.</p>
<p>God created man so that man would have His life and be the many brothers of His Son, but He also wanted man to deal with His enemy, Satan. Consequently, Satan deceived man in order to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; him from God. Before the fall of man, Satan and his angels were in rebellion against God. With the fall, man joined Satan in his rebellion against God. Even though man fell and was rebellious, God did not destroy him, because He wants to fulfill His eternal purpose with man. In order for God to fulfill His eternal purpose with man, He needs to deliver man from Satan&rsquo;s hand and destroy Satan. Negatively, He has to deal with the problems caused by Satan by putting away sin, dealing with death, and destroying Satan. Positively, He desires that man would have His life and be conformed to the image of His Son in order to be His many brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION IN GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>In His eternal plan God not only created all things and man in order to accomplish His eternal purpose, but according to His foreknowledge that man would fall, He also planned for man&rsquo;s redemption after the fall. Redemption in God&rsquo;s plan was not something in His consideration only after the fall. God&rsquo;s plan was predetermined by Him in eternity past, and God prepared Christ, the Accomplisher of His redemption &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:20). In His eternal plan God determined that Christ would accomplish redemption after man&rsquo;s fall; thus, Christ was slain &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (Rev. 13:8).</p>
<p>Just as God&rsquo;s creation is according to His plan, God&rsquo;s redemption is according to His plan. In God&rsquo;s plan there are both creation and redemption. Creation alone cannot accomplish His plan; there is a need for redemption in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. In God&rsquo;s plan creation is for redemption. God created all things and planned for redemption. Creation is only the beginning of God&rsquo;s procedure to accomplish His plan; redemption is the completion of this procedure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHECIES OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Redemption was preplanned, predetermined, by God. Even before redemption was accomplished, God clearly spoke of various aspects of redemption through many prophecies in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>In Genesis 3, after man sinned, fell, and was &ldquo;stolen away&rdquo; by Satan, God came in to curse Satan and to speak of His promise of the seed of the woman, saying, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel&rdquo; (v. 15). The Lord promised that the seed of the woman would bruise Satan on the head; that is, a seed would come and deal with the seducing, incriminating, and corrupting serpent. Whereas Satan would bruise the seed of the woman on the heel, the seed of the woman would put the seducing, incriminating, and corrupting Satan to death. Although Satan would afflict the seed of the woman, Satan&rsquo;s bruising could not destroy him, because the bruising would merely be to his heel. The seed of the woman, however, would bruise Satan fatally on the head.</p>
<p>When Eve gave birth to Cain, she thought Cain was the seed that God had promised (4:1). Although Cain was born of Eve, a woman, he was not the seed of a woman but the seed of a man, Adam. The genealogies in the Bible always present offspring as being the seed of a man, not of a woman. Thus, everyone who is born of a father in the flesh cannot be considered to be the seed of a woman.</p>
<p>The New Testament fulfillment of this seed is the Lord Jesus (Matt. 1:23). Among all mankind, only He was born of a woman (Gal. 4:4). He came to the earth to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). Through death He destroyed him who had the might of death, that is, the devil (Heb. 2:14). Hence, when Satan &ldquo;stole&rdquo; man away, God&rsquo;s promise of a seed was a promise that Christ would come to be born of a woman so that He might destroy Satan.</p><h2 class="head2">A Virgin Conceiving and Bearing a Son</h2>
<p>Approximately three thousand years after man fell, God promised through Isaiah the prophet, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (Isa. 7:14). At this point, God&rsquo;s promise of redemption, as revealed in Genesis 3, was made even clearer. It revealed that the coming Christ would not be born of a married woman but of a virgin. Furthermore, this Christ, who was to be born of a virgin to become man&rsquo;s Savior, is God with us, Immanuel. Christ&rsquo;s coming among men was God&rsquo;s coming among men; Christ&rsquo;s becoming man&rsquo;s Savior was God&rsquo;s becoming man&rsquo;s Savior. In other words, God Himself was born of a virgin to be man&rsquo;s Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Child Being Born to Us,<br />
a Son Being Given to Us</h2>
<p>Although our Savior Christ is spoken of as being a child, He is called Mighty God, and although He is the Son, He is called Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6). This promise of God clearly tells us that the coming Christ is man yet God, the Son yet the Father. Christ is the union of God and man, the Father manifested in the Son. His coming joined God and man and brought God to man. His coming manifested the Father in the Son and revealed the Father to man. Although He came to be a man, He was God. Although He came to be the Son, He was the Father. Although He came to be a child on the earth, He was the Mighty God in heaven. Although He came into time to be manifested as the Son, He was the self-existing and ever-existing Father (Rev. 1:8; Exo. 3:14-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">His Goings Forth Being from Ancient Times,<br />
from the Days of Eternity</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; Christ was born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:1, 6), but His source was in eternity. He came forth from eternity into time. He was God in eternity, but He came to be a man in time. Although He was a man in time, He belonged to eternity. Although He belonged to eternity, He came to live in time. He is both God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living as a Man on the Earth</h2>
<p>The various details of the living of this God-promised Redeemer as a man on the earth are presented clearly by Isaiah the prophet. According to Isaiah 53:2, the Lord Jesus grew up like a tender plant, and He was born into a humble home, like a root out of dry ground, without an abundant supply or a comfortable living. Furthermore, according to the same verse, He had no attracting form nor majesty that people should desire Him. According to 52:14, His visage was marred more than that of any man, and His form more than that of the sons of men. He did not have a beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>He was despised and forsaken of men and was like one from whom men hid their faces, and God&rsquo;s people did not esteem Him. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief (53:3), because He bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows (v. 4). He did no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth (v. 9). He was without sin and never sinned (Heb. 4:15). However, men oppressed Him and afflicted Him, and He was cut off. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. He was like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers. He did not speak for Himself and did not defend Himself (Isa. 53:7-8). He was numbered with the transgressors at His death, yet He interceded for the transgressors (v. 12). Man&rsquo;s evil intention was to assign Him a grave with the wicked, yet God arranged for Him to be with the rich in His death (v. 9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Causing Him to Bear Our Sin</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was afflicted and cut off to bear our sin; Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him (v. 6). Although He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth (v. 9), Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. He made Himself an offering for sin (v. 10). He was stricken and cut off because He bore our sin (vv. 8, 12). He was wounded because of our transgressions, and He was crushed because of our iniquities so that by His chastening we may have peace, and by His stripes we may be healed (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scene and the Pain of His Death</h2>
<p>In Psalm 22 God prophesied quite vividly through David concerning the scene and the pain of Christ&rsquo;s death (vv. 1, 7-8, 12-18). In this psalm the Spirit of Christ, speaking as Christ Himself, describes His dreadful surroundings and His inward and outward pain when He was being put to death. Violent and wicked men surrounded Him, encompassing Him like mighty bulls (v. 12). They opened their mouth at Him, like a ravening and roaring lion (v. 13). A company of evildoers enclosed Him like dogs, and they pierced His hands and feet (v. 16). They divided His garments to themselves and cast lots for His clothing (v. 18). They looked, they stared at Him (v. 17). All who saw Him derided Him; they sneered at Him and shook their heads, saying, &ldquo;He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him; / Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him&rdquo; (v. 8).</p>
<p>  He delivered up His life on the cross, like water poured out, and He hung on the cross for six hours with His bones being out of joint (v. 14). He counted all His bones (v. 17). His heart was like wax, and it was melted within Him because He was judged by God, burned by God&rsquo;s wrath on our behalf (v. 14). His strength was dried up like a shard, and His pain was so severe that His tongue was stuck to His jaws (v. 15). At the end of His crucifixion, God forsook Him because He bore our sins, and He cried out, saying, &ldquo;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; (v. 1). Finally, God put Him in the dust of death (v. 15).</p><h2 class="head2">The Efficacy of His Death</h2>
<p>In chapter 53, Isaiah prophesied concerning the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s death: &ldquo;He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous&rdquo; (v. 11). When we believed in Christ&rsquo;s death on our behalf, we turned to Him and were justified. Christ gained us through His death, and we gained righteousness. Hence, Christ saw the fruit of the travail of His soul and was satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Both Isaiah&rsquo;s and David&rsquo;s prophecies speak of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Isaiah 53:10 says, &ldquo;He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.&rdquo; This means that Christ would be resurrected and live forever to give man His life and make man His seed so that through him He might fulfill God&rsquo;s pleasure. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection extended His days and enabled Him to live in those who are of His seed for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s good pleasure.</p>
<p>In Psalm 22:22 David took on the voice of Christ, saying, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to my brothers; / In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ in resurrection caused men to have His life and become His brothers so that He might declare God&rsquo;s name to them and praise God in their midst. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection gained men as His brothers, His church. Then He could reveal God and praise God in their midst.</p>
<p>These aspects concerning God&rsquo;s redemption were presented in the Old Testament. He was born a man, lived on the earth as a man, bore man&rsquo;s sins, endured death on the cross, and resurrected from the dead so that man could have His life and be His brothers. All these aspects were promised to us in prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TYPES OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In addition to the plain prophetic words in the Old Testament, God also used many persons, matters, and things in the Old Testament as types to declare, describe, reveal, and speak forth the mysterious and glorious redemption that He had planned and ordained. These types, in contrast to plain words, are pictures that reveal and make known His mysterious redemption. God uses both &ldquo;text&rdquo; and &ldquo;illustrations&rdquo; to reveal His mysterious redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Coats of Skin with Which<br />
Adam and Eve Were Clothed</h2>
<p>The coats of skin that were used as a covering for Adam and Eve are the first indication in type of God&rsquo;s promised redemption. When man fell, God not only spoke of the promise of the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15), but He also clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skin (v. 21). Initially, Adam and Eve were sinless and not ashamed of their nakedness (2:25). However, after they sinned and fell, they were ashamed of their nakedness. Although they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves (3:7), this could not cover their shame and sinfulness. Therefore, God made coats of skin to clothe and cover them.</p>
<p>The coats of skin must have involved the shedding of the blood of a slain sacrifice. Adam and Eve had both eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and according to God&rsquo;s commandment, they should have died that day (2:17). However, a sacrifice was killed, and its blood was shed in their place for the forgiveness of sins (Heb. 9:22). Thus, the skin of this sacrifice became a covering for their sin so that they could live before God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s making coats of skin typifies His making the Lord Jesus our righteousness so that in Him we could be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:24; Phil. 3:9). In the fulfillment of this type the Lord Jesus was slain, and His blood was shed for us. Then He became our righteousness so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Offerings of the Forefathers</h2>
<p>God also used the offerings of the forefathers to indicate that He would make it possible for fallen sinners to draw near to Him and be accepted by Him through His foreordained redemption. Abel (Gen. 4:4), Noah (8:20-22), Abraham (12:7-8; 22:13), Isaac (26:25), and Jacob (35:6-7) all communed with God and were acceptable to God through their offerings. They were sinful and alienated from God, but they were able to draw near to God because their sacrifices, involving the shedding of blood, covered their sins. These offerings typify Christ drawing those who believe in Him near to God through His redemption so that they may serve God and be acceptable to God. The forefathers had a foretaste of Christ and His redemption through their offerings.</p><h2 class="head2">The Passover</h2>
<p>At the time of the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, God charged them to keep the Passover as a feast (Exo. 12:1-14). The Passover is an even more perfect type of the redemption that He planned in eternity. The children of Israel, like the Egyptians, had fallen into the world, were sinful and in opposition to God, and should have been slain with the Egyptians. But God provided salvation for the children of Israel through the slaying of a lamb. According to those familiar with Israel&rsquo;s ancient history, when the children of Israel slew the passover lamb, they crossed two pieces of wood and tied the lamb&rsquo;s two forelegs to the two ends of the horizontal piece, and the lamb&rsquo;s two hind legs to the bottom of the vertical piece; it was just like a crucifixion. This is truly a perfect picture of the redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross (1 Cor. 5:7). God foreordained that Christ would be the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Just as a lamb was a substitute for the children of Israel, Christ is our Substitute. Just as the lamb&rsquo;s blood was shed to redeem the children of Israel, Christ&rsquo;s blood was shed so that we might be redeemed (1 Pet. 1:18-19). Just as eating the flesh of the lamb inwardly strengthened the children of Israel, the life of Christ inwardly strengthens us. Just as the redemption of the lamb brought the children of Israel to God, the redemption of Christ brings us to God. And just as the children of Israel were joined to the lamb by being in a house with blood-stricken doorposts and lintel and by eating the flesh of the lamb, we are joined with Christ by being in Him through His redemption and by receiving Christ into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Manna</h2>
<p>The types mentioned above emphasize Christ&rsquo;s bearing our sins so that we may be delivered from God&rsquo;s wrath and be made acceptable to God. However, in His redemption God planned that Christ would not only bear our sins according to His righteousness but also be our life, our bread of life, which would become a part of us so that we may live because of Him (John 6:57). God illustrated this point, using manna as a type (Exo. 16:31-32; John 6:31-35). Although the flesh of the passover lamb was food to the children of Israel, indicating Christ&rsquo;s being the inner strength and satisfaction of His redeemed, the Passover, as a type, does not give great stress to the matter of food. Instead, God emphasizes through the type of manna that Christ would come to be the bread of life to His redeemed so that they might be fed inwardly. Just as manna came down out of heaven, Christ came down out of heaven, and just as manna sustained the children of Israel in their journey through the wilderness, Christ sustains us in our journey through this world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Rock</h2>
<p>God ordained that Christ would be not only our bread of life but also our water of life. Hence, manna typifies Christ coming down out of heaven to be our bread of life (Exo. 16:15-18; John 6:31), and the rock typifies Christ being stricken on the cross to flow out as water of life to us (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). Moses represents the law, and his striking of the rock with his rod indicates that Christ was struck by the power of the law. Just as the rock was cleft to flow out water to quench the thirst of the children of Israel, Christ was cleft to flow out the water of life to quench our thirst so that we may be satisfied inwardly (John 7:37-38).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle and Its Furniture</h2>
<p>The most perfect type of Christ&rsquo;s mysterious and glorious redemption is the tabernacle and its furniture (Exo. 25&mdash;27; 30:1-10, 17-21), which are fine, beautiful pictures portraying the wonderful redemption that our wise God planned according to His good will. Everything within the tabernacle, great or small, portrays and typifies Christ and His eternal redemption (Heb. 9:1-14, 23-26; 10:1-14, 19-20).</p>
<p>The tabernacle was covered with coarse porpoise skins on the outside (Exo. 26:14), yet it had beautiful gold on the inside (25:10-40; 26:29). This typifies Christ as the Word becoming flesh to tabernacle among us (John 1:14). Although He was a lowly man who had no outwardly attracting form nor majesty (Isa. 53:2), the God of glory was in Him, and He was full of honor and glory. Just as God was manifested among and to the children of Israel through the tabernacle, Christ is manifested among us and to us. Just as God communed with the children of Israel through the tabernacle, we commune with Him through Christ. And just as the tabernacle was a place in which God met man and man met God, Christ is the place where God can fellowship with man and man can fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The bronze altar and the bronze laver were in the outer court of the tabernacle (Exo. 40:6-7). The bronze altar is where the offerings were offered; all the offerings of the children of Israel had to be offered to God on this altar. The altar typifies the cross (Heb. 13:10); Christ offered Himself on the cross to God (9:14). The bronze covering of the altar was beaten from the bronze censers of Korah&rsquo;s company, which had rebelled against God and had been judged by God (Num. 16:37-39); hence, bronze represents judgment. On the bronze altar the offering became a substitute for the offerer, who should have been judged by God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. Through the offering the offerer was forgiven and accepted by God. Similarly, Christ was judged by God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on the cross as a Substitute for all who would believe into Him so that they might be forgiven and accepted by God. All who entered into the tabernacle to draw near to God and serve God had to pass through the bronze altar and present an offering. Likewise, all those who would draw near to God and serve God must first pass through the cross of Christ and receive the crucified Christ as their Savior, their Substitute.</p>
<p>Those who passed through the bronze altar then had to pass through the bronze laver to be washed before they could go into the Tent of Meeting, to serve God (Exo. 40:30-31). The bronze laver was made from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and it reflected man&rsquo;s condition (38:8). The bronze laver typifies the Holy Spirit exposing the defilement of those who are drawing near to God and serving God, according to and through the judgment that Christ received on the cross, so that they might be washed (John 16:7-8; Titus 3:5). Once a person passed through the bronze altar and the laver, he could enter into the tabernacle to partake of everything in the tabernacle. This shows that after we have passed through the redemption of Christ on the cross and the washing and renewing of the Holy Spirit, we can partake of everything in Christ.</p>
<p>The tabernacle itself was divided into two parts&mdash;the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. In the Holy Place there were three pieces of furniture&mdash;the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. These typify Christ&rsquo;s function in the believers. The table of the bread of the Presence was made of pure gold and acacia wood (Exo. 25:23-24). Pure gold typifies the glorious divinity of Christ, and acacia wood typifies His strong humanity. The table of the bread of the Presence typifies Christ who is both God and man becoming life in the believers so that they might live in God&rsquo;s presence (Col. 3:4). The golden lampstand lit the Holy Place, and it typifies Christ being the light of life in the believers so that we might have fellowship with God and serve God according to this light (John 1:4; 8:12). The priests burned incense to God on the golden incense altar. It also was made of pure gold and acacia wood, typifying how Christ, who is both God and man, would be our acceptable incense before God so that our prayers might be accepted by God (Rev. 8:3-4).</p>
<p>There was a separating veil in the tabernacle between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. It was within the veil, that is, in the Holy of Holies, that God appeared to man and spoke with man (Heb. 10:19-20). Before Christ died on the cross in the flesh, the way to enter into the Holy of Holies was not open for man. When Christ was cleft on the cross through His death, however, the veil covering the Holy of Holies was split as well (Matt. 27:50-51). Thus, the death of Christ removed the veil between us and God and opened the way for us to draw near to God.</p>
<p>The innermost part of the tabernacle was the Holy of Holies, which was the location of the Ark. The Ark is also called the Ark of the Testimony, and it was made of pure gold and acacia wood (Exo. 25:10-11, 22; 26:33-34). Inside the Ark there were the golden pot containing manna, the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tablets of the covenant (Heb. 9:4). The blood of the sin offering was sprinkled on the expiation cover above the Ark (Exo. 25:17, 21; Lev. 16:15), and God appeared to man and met with man above this blood-sprinkled cover (Exo. 25:21-22). The Ark typifies Christ, who is both God and man, as God&rsquo;s testimony, the One in whom is God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s resurrection power (John 11:25), and God&rsquo;s law (Psa. 40:8). In Christ and by His redeeming blood, God supplies man with grace and meets with man. Now man can draw near to God and commune with God. Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood enables man to be graced with the life of God (1 John 5:12), the power of resurrection (Phil. 3:10), and the law of life (Heb. 8:10). Under the blood and based on the blood, man is hidden with Christ in God (Col. 3:3). Through His redeeming blood, Christ enables man to enjoy God&rsquo;s life, the resurrection power of God&rsquo;s life, and the law of God&rsquo;s life, and man is joined with God. This is the testimony that God desires to express in and through Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Five Offerings Recorded in Leviticus</h2>
<p>The five offerings recorded in Leviticus show in an even clearer way how Christ offered Himself up to God to redeem us (1:1&mdash;6:7). These five offerings speak of various aspects of Christ, and together they show that Christ is the one complete and perfect offering. The burnt offering typifies Christ who lived absolutely for God, who obeyed God even unto death (Phil. 2:8), and who offered Himself without blemish to God (Heb. 9:14). The meal offering typifies the fine, perfect, and holy human living of Christ, who through death offered Himself up to God, and whose living was offered up to God as a satisfying, fragrant offering. The peace offering typifies Christ&rsquo;s offering Himself up to make peace, that is, to reconcile man to God and God to man in order to become the enjoyment and satisfaction of God and man (Col. 1:20; Lev. 7:28-34). The sin offering signifies Christ being made sin on our behalf on the cross in order to deal with the indwelling sin in our nature (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3; 7:20). The trespass offering signifies Christ&rsquo;s bearing all our transgressions before God in order to deal with our sinful deeds (1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Birds for the Cleansing of a Leper</h2>
<p>Our sins cause us not only to have a record of sins before God, but they also defile us. Once we sin, we are defiled like lepers and cannot draw near to God. Thus, in Leviticus 14 God speaks of the cleansing of a leper to typify how He cleanses sinners. In this record one bird was slaughtered, and its blood was sprinkled on a leper to indicate Christ&rsquo;s dying for us to remove our sinful defilement. The second bird was let loose into an open field to indicate Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, which releases us redeemed sinners from our weaknesses by the power of His resurrection life (vv. 1-7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Two Male Goats for the Day of Expiation</h2>
<p>In Leviticus 16, the two male goats for the Day of Expiation further portray the redemption that Christ accomplished for us (vv. 5, 7-10, 15-22). According to verse 8, Aaron cast lots on the two goats: one lot for Jehovah and the other lot for Azazel. Aaron then presented the goat on which Jehovah&rsquo;s lot fell as a sin offering (v. 9). He brought its blood inside the veil, sprinkled it upon the expiation cover and on the altar seven times (vv. 15, 19). The goat on which Azazel&rsquo;s lot fell, however, was sent away for Azazel into the wilderness (v. 10).</p>
<p>The first goat typifies Christ being slain for our sins. His blood was brought into the heavens and sprinkled before God (signified by the blood sprinkled on the expiation cover) to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirements so that God could forgive us of our sins. His blood was sprinkled also on the cross (signified by the blood sprinkled on the altar) so that we may have peace in our heart, knowing that our sins have been forgiven. The second goat indicates Christ, through the efficacy of the cross, sending sin itself away from us back to Satan, signified by Azazel. Christ&rsquo;s death and the blood He shed on the cross brought us forgiveness of sins before God (Heb. 9:22), purified us from the defilement of sin in our conscience (v. 14), and sent sin itself away from us to the author of sin, the source of sin, Satan (John 1:29; Heb. 9:26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ashes of the Red Heifer</h2>
<p>In Numbers 19 the eternal efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption can be seen in the type of the ashes of the red heifer. The red heifer that was slaughtered and burned typifies Christ&rsquo;s being slain (vv. 2-3, 5). The ashes of the red heifer typify the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and these ashes were added into the water for impurity, which was then sprinkled on the unclean so that they might be cleansed (v. 9); this typifies the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which continuously cleanses defiled sinners by the living water of life in order to restore their fellowship with God (1 John 1:7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bronze Serpent</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemption not only takes away our sins so that we may draw near to God but also enlivens our sin-deadened spirit. This is typified in the account of the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:4-9. In chapter 21 the children of Israel had sinned, and they were bitten and poisoned by deadly serpents. This speaks of man sinning and of his being poisoned with deadly sins by the ancient serpent (1 Cor. 15:55-56; Rev. 12:9), the devil. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpents that bit the children of Israel but not their poison; it was set on a pole as a curse and judged on behalf of the children of Israel (Deut. 21:22-23). This typifies Christ, who was sent &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3) but who &ldquo;did not know sin&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21). Furthermore, &ldquo;on the tree&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24), that is, on the cross, He was &ldquo;made sin on our behalf&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21) and became &ldquo;a curse on our behalf&rdquo; (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>In Numbers 21 Moses represents the law, and bronze signifies judgment. Moses&rsquo; setting the bronze serpent on a pole signifies the law&rsquo;s judgment of Christ on the cross. All the children of Israel who were bitten by serpents lived when they looked at the bronze serpent. This signifies that everyone who has sinned and should die can have God&rsquo;s eternal life and be regenerated when they look at Christ, who was lifted up on the cross, and believe (John 3:14-15). When the bronze serpent was judged on behalf of the children of Israel, it also resulted in judgment upon the poisonous biting serpents. Similarly, Christ&rsquo;s judgment on the cross on our behalf also judged the seducing, corrupting, and incriminating Satan as well (12:31-32; 16:11). Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross not only took away man&rsquo;s sins and regenerated man; it also judged and destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>We have briefly explained the types in the Old Testament related to God&rsquo;s mysterious redemption, which serve as a blueprint of the mysterious and glorious redemption that our wise Designer planned in eternity. If we consider this blueprint along with the prophecies concerning Christ, we will be even clearer. Before His redemption was manifested, God presented His plan of redemption to man through prophecies and types. Then at the appropriate time He accomplished His redemption according to these prophecies and types.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ACCOMPLISHING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">INCARNATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 1:20-23; Gal. 4:4; John 1:1-3, 14; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 2:14; Phil. 2:6-8; Rom. 8:3; 5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45</h1>
<p>In the Old Testament, before accomplishing redemption, God spoke of His redemption in detail through prophecies and types. In this chapter we will consider how God intended to accomplish redemption according to His plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>The first step that God took toward accomplishing redemption was to become flesh (John 1:1, 14). God desires to gain man; He wants man to receive His life, to be joined to Him, to be the brothers of Christ, and to deal with His enemy, Satan. This was God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man, but the created man sinned and fell. God intended for man to be His expression, but man sinned and fell short of God&rsquo;s glory (Gen. 1:26; Rom. 3:23). God also desired that man would cooperate with Him to destroy His adversary, Satan, but man rebelled against God and followed Satan.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances God could have responded in several ways. He could have chosen to destroy both the man, whom He had created and who sinned and rebelled against Him, and Satan, whom man followed. This would have been easy. The more difficult way involved rescuing the man who had sinned and followed His enemy. If God had chosen the easy way, it would not have been possible for His eternal plan to be accomplished, but since God chose the difficult way of rescuing man, His eternal plan could be accomplished. In order to accomplish redemption for man, therefore, God had to become flesh. The accomplishment of redemption required the incarnation of Christ for at least six reasons.</p>
<p>First, in order to satisfy the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory, God had to deal with man&rsquo;s sins. However, in order to deal with man&rsquo;s sins, God had to stand in the position of a man, according to the status of a man. In order to bear the curse of sin, receive God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, and suffer the pain of death on behalf of man, God had to become a man through incarnation so that He could be in the position and status of a man.</p>
<p>Second, God had to deal with corruption in man&rsquo;s nature, which was an issue of the fall. On the one hand, God needed to rescue the man whom He had created, but on the other hand, He needed to terminate the man who was corrupted. Hence, God was incarnated to become flesh and to put on humanity in order to bring humanity with Him through death and into resurrection. God terminated corrupted humanity through His death on the cross, and He rescued created humanity in His resurrection.</p>
<p>Third, God had to deal with Satan, who corrupted man. Satan was originally an archangel created by God, but he rebelled against God and became the adversary of God. God does not want to come as the Creator in order to deal with one of His creatures. Instead, He wants man, another creature, to deal with the creature who rebelled against Him. Regrettably, man was deceived by Satan and entered into an illicit union with him. Man was corrupted by Satan. In order to rescue the Satan-deceived man from Satan&rsquo;s hand and also to destroy this rebellious archangel through man, God had to become a creature through incarnation. Colossians 1:15 says that He is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rdquo; In order to deal with the creature who had rebelled against Him, God assumed the status of a creature and was joined to humanity.</p>
<p>Fourth, God had to enable fallen men to come near to Him. As a result of the fall, human beings were far from God. It was impossible for them to come near to God. Because fallen sinners have no way to approach or stand before the God of glory, God came in the flesh in the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7), concealing His glory in the flesh of His humanity. This enabled men to come near to Him, because they were approaching a man, not God.</p>
<p>Fifth, God had to reveal Himself so that men could know Him. Men can perceive God&rsquo;s eternal power and divine characteristics through the things that He created (Rom. 1:20). Furthermore, men can know God&rsquo;s ways and see His wisdom through the Scriptures. But unless He came out of His sanctuary in the heavens to be among men as a person in the likeness of a man, it would not be possible to see God or know Him directly. Therefore, God became a man in order to be comprehensible to men. He presented Himself to men in bodily form so that men could see and know Him.</p>
<p>Sixth, God had to become a man in order to be joined with man. God&rsquo;s intention in creating man was for man to be one with Him, but man sinned and thus could not be joined to God. Therefore, God joined Himself to man so that man would be joined to Him. This was accomplished through incarnation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH</h2>
<p>The Word becoming flesh means that God and man were joined as one. Our words express and represent us. Likewise, the Word of God expressed and manifested God (John 1:1). The word <em>flesh</em> points to the physical body of fallen man. The Bible often refers to fallen man as flesh because fallen man lives according to his flesh (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16; 1 Cor. 1:29). Therefore, the flesh refers not only to the physical body of fallen man but also to man after the fall. The Word becoming flesh means that the manifested God became a man of flesh in the likeness of a sinful man. By doing so, God entered into sinful man and became one with sinful man. However, He had only the likeness of sinful man and not the sin of sinful man. When the Word became flesh, God was manifested in the flesh (John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16). The Word is God, and the Word becoming flesh is God being manifested. This manifestation is in the flesh, that is, in humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE LIKENESS<br />
OF THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Although the Word becoming flesh is God being manifested in and joined to fallen man, the Lord Jesus had only the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). The Lord Jesus was without the sin of fallen man, just as the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:6-9 had the form of a serpent but not its poison. The bronze serpent is a type of Christ, the incarnated God (John 3:14). Although Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He did not know sin (2 Cor. 5:21). He became a man with the human nature, but He did not have the sin in the fallen human nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BORN OF A WOMAN</h2>
<p>Christ did not have sin, because He was born of a woman and not of a man (Gal. 4:4). Every person who is born on earth is of the seed of man. Only Christ is not of the seed of man; He is of the seed of a woman (Gen. 3:15). Christ is not of the seed of Adam, and He does not have Adam&rsquo;s sinful life. The Lord&rsquo;s humanity was conceived in the womb of a chaste virgin through the Holy Spirit. He did not possess Adam&rsquo;s sinful nature, because He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a woman (Luke 1:34-35; Matt. 1:20-23). Although Christ was not touched by man&rsquo;s sin, He had a genuine human nature and was in the likeness of men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN</h2>
<p>Christ existed in the form of God, but in order to accomplish redemption and be joined to man, He laid aside the form of God and put on the likeness of men, even taking the form of a slave (Phil. 2:6-7). According to His outward form, He was a man. Consequently, the Jews, who saw and knew Him according to His outward likeness, insisted that He was merely a man. They refused to believe Him when He said, &ldquo;I am the Son of God&rdquo; (John 10:33-36), and people regarded Him only as a man from Nazareth, that is, as an ordinary man born of human parents (1:45; Matt. 13:55-56). Even His disciples recognized Him as a man, because He was a genuine man (8:27).</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GENUINE MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was a genuine man. There was nothing about Him that caused people to doubt that He was a man. The Bible refers to Him as a man (1 Tim. 2:5), and the Lord Jesus also referred to Himself as the Son of Man (Luke 19:10; Matt. 16:13, 27; John 3:14). Even though He is God and the angels minister to Him, He was made a little inferior to the angels (Heb. 2:9). This means that He was in the likeness of men, in the likeness of those whom He would rescue (v. 14), possessing the human life and nature and partaking of flesh and blood. He was made like us in all things, but He was without sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Adam is a type of the Lord Jesus (Rom. 5:14). Adam was a man, and the Lord is a man. Adam was the first Adam, the first man, but the Lord Jesus is the last Adam, the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). Just as Adam was the head and representative of all human beings, who were in him as his descendants, Christ is the Head and Representative of all the people who are in Him. Adam is one with those who belong to him, and he is the same as them in all things. Christ is also one with those who belong to Him, and He is like them in all things except in the matter of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GOD YET MAN</h2>
<p>Although the Lord Jesus was made like us, yet without sin, He is not only a man; He is also God. He is God yet man. He is God, but He became a man. He is a genuine man, and He is the true God. He possesses the human life and nature, and He also possesses the divine life and nature. He bears the image and likeness of a man, and He also bears the image of God. While He lived on earth, His outward form was that of a man, but inwardly He was also God. People saw His human life and nature, but He was filled also with the divine life and nature. He expressed the human image and likeness, but hidden within Him was God&rsquo;s image. Outwardly He had &ldquo;no attracting form nor majesty,&rdquo; but inwardly He was full of God&rsquo;s glory and beauty (Isa. 53:2; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). He descended out of heaven, but He was still in heaven (John 3:13). He spoke of Himself as the Son of Man (1:51), and He also spoke of Himself as the Son of God (9:35-38). He even said that He was one with the Father (10:30). He was manifested among men as a man, but He also let people know that He was equal with God and that He was God (5:17-18; 10:33).</p>
<p>The Lord lived a human life on earth, and He was found in fashion as a man. Hence, people believed that He was a man. At the same time, however, He executed God&rsquo;s authority, exercised God&rsquo;s wisdom, and manifested God&rsquo;s glory so that people could see that He was the very God. At the wedding feast in Cana He changed water into wine. Then people realized that He was God the Creator, who can create something out of nothing (2:1-11; 1:3; Rom. 4:17). In a boat on the Sea of Galilee He rebuked the wind and the sea, bringing in a great calm. Then the disciples realized that He was God, who rules over all things (Mark 4:35-41).</p>
<p> Until He took Peter, James, and John to a high mountain, they thought that the Lord was a man just like them. When He was transfigured, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light, they realized that He was one with the God of glory (Matt. 17:1-8). In the matter of paying the temple tax, Peter considered the Lord only in His status as a man and a law-abiding citizen. But when He directed Peter to get a stater from the mouth of a fish in order to pay the temple tax, the Lord showed Peter that He was God to whom all things belong (vv. 24-27). When the Lord wept in front of a sorrowful crowd by Lazarus&rsquo;s tomb, people saw Him as a genuine man, full of human emotions. When He later cried out for Lazarus to come out from the tomb, people saw that He was the ever-living God, who gives life to the dead (John 11:25-44).</p>
<p>When the Lord prayed in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, and His sweat was like great drops of blood, His sufferings as a man were apparent (Luke 22:39-46). When the Roman cohort and the attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees came to arrest Him, however, He identified Himself with the words &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; (&ldquo;I Am&rdquo; is the meaning of the name Jehovah, as in Exodus 3:14.) This caused those who came to draw back and fall to the ground (John 18:1-8). He manifested Jehovah, the One who has authority. He was Jesus the Nazarene whom they sought to arrest, but He was also Jehovah, the self-existing and ever-existing great I Am. Outwardly He was in the lowly, humble likeness of a man, but inwardly He was filled with the glorious image of God. The glorious image of God was concealed within His lowly and humble likeness of a man, just as the glory and beauty of the gold in the tabernacle was hidden within by rough and tough porpoise skins (Exo. 36:19). Nevertheless, His actions revealed God&rsquo;s image and glory through the veil of His flesh. He was a genuine man and the true God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God mingled with man. God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to enter into man and be joined with man. God wanted man to receive Him and be joined to Him, but man failed. Hence, God became a man and put on humanity, taking the image and likeness of a man and possessing the human life and nature. Now He is one with man and inseparable from man. When He lived on the earth, He was the Son of Man who put on humanity and had a body of flesh and blood, and even after being designated the Son of God in His resurrection, He still has a body of flesh and bones and the human nature (Rom. 1:4; Luke 24:39; John 20:27). Furthermore, now that He is sitting at the right hand of God in His ascension, He is still the Son of Man with the human nature (Acts 7:55-56). Ultimately, in His second coming in the glory of God, He will be the Son of Man, still in possession of His human nature (Matt. 26:64). He is not only God joined to man in time, but God joined and mingled with man for eternity. Just as God possesses the divine life and nature, the Lord Jesus possesses the divine life and nature. Just as God possesses might and glory, the Lord Jesus also possesses might and glory. The Lord is a genuine man, and He is also God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMMANUEL</h2>
<p>Even though the Lord Jesus was a man in the flesh, He was God coming to be with man. Therefore, He was given the name Emmanuel. He was called by the name Jesus and also by the name Emmanuel. God gave Him the name Jesus, but people called His name Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:21, 23). As the embodiment of God, the Lord Jesus is the declaration and manifestation of God among men (John 1:18). He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15). He is God. When He was among men, God was among men. Therefore, He said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2>
<p>The Lord allowed people to worship Him and call Him God, because He is God manifested in the flesh, God living among men and with men (Matt. 8:2; 20:20; John 20:28). This is the great mystery of godliness (1 Tim. 3:16). God was hidden in man, His glory was concealed within human flesh, and the Creator was joined to His creatures. What a mystery! This was not only God mingled with man but also eternity joined to time, heaven united with earth, and the invisible blended with the visible. The eternal God was mingled with man in time, God in heaven was joined to man on earth, and the Creator was blended with His creatures. Hence, time, space, and creation were joined to God, were filled with God, and expressed God. Therefore, this mystery is great and godly. <em>Godly</em> means that God is manifested so that man can see Him. The Word becoming flesh was for God to be manifested in man, that is, in time, space, and creation, so that God could be seen by man. This is a great mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD REVEALING JESUS AS THE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The central revelation of the Bible is God becoming a man in order to be mingled with man. In the Gospel of Matthew God revealed to Peter that Jesus is the Son of God (16:13-17). When Peter ranked Jesus with Moses, who represents the law, and with Elijah, who represents the prophets, God came in and said that Jesus, the Son of Man, is His beloved Son (17:1-8). Even people as great as Moses and Elijah cannot be ranked with His beloved Son. The Lord told the Pharisees that He is the son of David and also the Lord of David (22:41-45). Romans 1:3-4 says, &ldquo;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; On the one hand, as the son of David, the Lord is a man, and on the other hand, as the Lord of David, He is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PEOPLE BELIEVING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>While living as a man in the flesh, Christ repeatedly said that God was in Him and that He was in God; that is, Christ was mingled with God (John 10:38; 14:10). Although Christ was manifested as the Son of Man, He wanted people to believe that He is the Son of God (9:35-38). Christ was a man with a human body, but He wanted people to believe that He is God (20:27-29). The Bible testifies that Jesus is the Son of God so that by believing we may have life in His name (v. 31). In order to be saved we must confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in our heart that God has raised Him from the dead (Rom. 10:9). To call Him Jesus is to confess that He is a man, but to call Him Lord is to confess that He is God. When we believe and confess that Jesus is the Son of God, we abide in God and He in us (1 John 5:5; 4:15). The Bible also says, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either,&rdquo; because the Son has declared the Father (2:23; 2 John 9; John 1:18). Believing that Jesus is the Son of God enables us to receive eternal life, because He is the true God and eternal life (1 John 5:11-12, 20). We must believe that Jesus is the incarnated God. We must believe that He is God and that He is also a man. He is God yet man and man yet God. We must believe that Christ has both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature and that He bears the likeness of a man and the image of God. Jesus Christ is God joined to and mingled with man. This is what we must believe, and this is what Satan refuses to confess.</p><h2 class="head1">SATAN REFUSING TO CONFESS JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>Satan, the evil spirits, and the demons know that God&rsquo;s intention is to destroy them through the man Jesus Christ; hence, they will not confess that &ldquo;Jesus Christ has come in the flesh&rdquo; (4:2-3). They know that the Lord Jesus came in His status as the Son of Man, not as the Son of God, in order to destroy them. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus came forth to work for God, Satan tempted Him to forsake His position as the Son of Man (Matt. 4:1-7). Twice Satan said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God&rdquo; (vv. 3, 6). His intention was to tempt the Lord to stand in His position as the Son of God and thus abandon His position as the Son of Man. Therefore, in verse 4 the Lord replied, &ldquo;Man shall...live.&rdquo; The Lord emphasized <em>man</em>. He knew that Satan&rsquo;s subtle intention was for Him to leave His position as the Son of Man; hence, He said, &ldquo;Man shall... live.&rdquo; In His answers the Lord proved that He was a man living before God. He was a man through whom God could deal with Satan. Satan could not carry out his subtle intention and had to depart because the Lord stood firmly in His position as a man.</p>
<p>Even though the Lord repeatedly said that He was the Son of Man, Satan&rsquo;s subordinates, the demons, repeatedly cried out that He was the Son of God (8:29). They would not confess that the Lord was the Son of Man, because they knew that He had come in His status as the Son of Man in order to deal with them.</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s ministry on earth was coming to an end, Satan used the high priest to tempt the Lord in the same way that he had tempted the Lord in the wilderness. This was Satan&rsquo;s final effort to tempt the Lord to leave His position as the Son of Man. The high priest asked, &ldquo;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (26:63). Although the Lord answered, &ldquo;You have said rightly,&rdquo; He added emphatically, &ldquo;You will see the Son of Man&rdquo; (v. 64). Satan constantly tried to tempt the Lord to leave His position as the Son of Man, but the Lord remained in His position as the Son of Man in order to deal with Satan.</p>
<p>Today the evil spirits are not willing to confess that the Lord has come in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3). They will not confess that He is a man. The evil spirits know that the Lord became flesh in order to accomplish redemption and to deal with them.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Satan is unwilling to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Son of Man. On the other hand, he does not want people to confess that the Lord Jesus is God, the Son of God. Satan knows that once he confesses that the Lord is the Son of Man, he will be destroyed, and he also knows that any person who confesses that the Lord is the Son of God will receive eternal life and be saved. Therefore, Satan confesses that the Lord is the Son of God but not the Son of Man, and he causes people to confess that the Lord is the Son of Man but not the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING BEYOND THE TEACHING OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are some who go beyond the teaching of Christ and reject the truth that Christ has two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity (2 John 9). Some people confess that Jesus was only a noble man, a religionist, a reformer, a person of universal love who served humanity and sacrificed for others, a model for human society, a teacher, and a philosopher. But they do not confess that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, who is one with God and is God. The Bible refers to such persons as antichrists (1 John 2:22). Such persons say that they believe in Christ, but they do not believe or confess that Jesus is the Christ. They may call themselves Christians, but they oppose and blaspheme Christ.</p>
<p>This kind of speaking concerning Christ is an invention of evil spirits that comes out of man&rsquo;s rebellious mind; it is not the revelation given to man by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. Such speaking goes beyond the teaching of Christ and does not confess that Christ is both God and man, possessing both divinity and humanity. Hence, those who have been saved by grace should reject persons who go beyond the teaching of Christ. God&rsquo;s children should not receive or even greet such ones in order to avoid sharing in their evil works of opposing and blaspheming Christ (2 John 10-11). We must neither associate with such ones nor fellowship with them, because their teaching and speaking deny the person of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER ERRONEOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>There are other erroneous concepts concerning the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Some people say that the Lord Jesus was the Son of God but that He was not one with God. They teach that the Father and the Son are separate persons in the Godhead. According to this concept, They are separate &ldquo;Gods&rdquo; who are merely related to each other. According to the truth, however, the Father and the Son are distinct, but They are not separate persons in the Godhead. They are one. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father (John 14:10). Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father (Matt. 11:27). Therefore, the Lord Jesus is God. We cannot see God or gain Him apart from the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Some people have the concept that the Lord Jesus was merely a man when He was on earth but that He became God after His ascension and was no longer a man. Such a concept comes from the imagination of an unenlightened mind. According to the Bible, in eternity past the Lord Jesus was God. In His incarnation He became flesh with genuine humanity, but He was still God. In His resurrection from the dead, the body of His humiliation was transfigured into a body of glory (Phil. 3:21). His resurrected body still possesses its human nature; He is still a man. He ascended into heaven with His resurrected body, and He is still a man with the human nature. He is also still God. In His second coming He will be the God of glory, but He will be manifested as a man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God, who created all things, becoming a man. He is God putting on humanity. He is God entering into man to be joined to man. He is God in life, nature, position, person, authority, glory, power, and wisdom. When He became a man, He put on the image and likeness of a man, possessing the human life and nature, living a human life on earth, and having the flavor of man. God in Christ became a man in order to accomplish redemption, thus solving God&rsquo;s problems and attaining His goal. In order for man to have God&rsquo;s life and become His expression, God became a man; He came in the likeness of man. In order for man to be joined to Him, God came to be joined to man. The Lord Jesus is God becoming a man. Even though He is a man, He is still God. He is God yet man and man yet God. This is our Savior!</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord Jesus, how glorious and how precious You are! We can draw near to You and contact You because You are the glorious God who became a lowly man, and You are the mighty Creator who became a small creature. You came out of unapproachable light and concealed Your matchless glory in the humble likeness of a man; hence, sinners can approach You, and tax collectors can be Your friends. Sinners can kiss Your feet, and those whom You love can recline on Your bosom. You touched the leper with Your hand, and You shed tears with those in sorrow. You have God&rsquo;s inward affections and the human nature. In You we see a genuine man and touch the true God. Only You are the complete God and the perfect man. You brought God to the earth, and You also brought man to the heavens. You were both God and man while You were on the earth, and You are still both God and man in the heavens. When You walked in the land of Judea, You were a man, and You were the incarnated Word. Today on the throne You are still God with the human nature. When You lived on earth, God was humbled in man, but today man is glorified in God. Lord, how glorious and precious this revelation is! We worship and praise You!</p>
<p>O glorious Lord, as we consider the coming day of glory, our heart leaps, and our mouth is filled with praise. Then Your human nature will be manifested in the glory of God for the universe and all creation to see that You are the incarnated God and the glorified man. You are God yet man and man yet God. Then all creation will see that You are the glorious mystery. We worship and praise You even now because we see and know You today. We desire to receive more revelation and to know You in a deeper way. We give You all honor and love. We praise Your lovely name forever and ever! Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ACCOMPLISHING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 53:6b, 11b, 10a, 5; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18a; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24; John 12:31; 16:11; Heb. 2:14b; Col. 2:15; Gal. 6:14; John 12:24; 19:34</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that incarnation was the first step of God&rsquo;s redemption. In this chapter we will consider the second step of God&rsquo;s redemption, the cross. The cross speaks of Christ&rsquo;s death; hence, to consider the cross is to consider Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Christ died on the cross in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s plan is to dispense His life into man, but man fell before he could receive God&rsquo;s life. As a result of the fall, man became sinful and corrupt within, and man belonged to Satan. Hence, in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, Christ had to deal with the three problems: man&rsquo;s sin, man&rsquo;s fallen humanity, and Satan. Christ also needed to release God&rsquo;s life in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Through His death on the cross Christ dealt with man&rsquo;s sin, man&rsquo;s corrupt nature, and Satan, and He also released God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>God has a purpose in His plan, but man&rsquo;s fall brought in three problems. In order for Christ to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan, He had to deal with all three problems and also fulfill the original purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. To deal with the problems that are the result of man&rsquo;s fall, Christ had to die on the cross and accomplish redemption. Redemption dealt with the negative problems in order to bring fallen man back to God. Moreover, through His death on the cross Christ released God&rsquo;s life to His redeemed people to fulfill the positive purpose of God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>On the cross Christ dealt with the problems of sin, the corrupt human nature, and Satan, and He also accomplished God&rsquo;s purpose of releasing His life. Hence, for us to have a thorough understanding of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, we will consider these four aspects of His death, according to the revelation of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ<br />
Dealing with Man&rsquo;s Sins</h2>
<p>As a result of the fall, man&rsquo;s first problem before God is sin. Sin contradicts God&rsquo;s righteousness, and God&rsquo;s righteousness cannot tolerate sin. God loves the man whom He created, but His righteousness requires Him to condemn man because of the fall (Rom. 5:16). God&rsquo;s heart may accept man, but His righteousness cannot tolerate man&rsquo;s sin. If God were to receive fallen man based only on His love, His righteousness would be offended. Righteousness is the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne (Psa. 89:14). Therefore, God must condemn man. God must be righteous and abide by His law; He cannot loosely tolerate or forgive man&rsquo;s sin based only on His love for man. If God were to receive man based on His love, He would not be righteous. No matter how much God values, treasures, or loves man, His righteousness requires that He condemn man because of sin.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s righteousness, death is the punishment for sin (Ezek. 18:4; Rom. 6:23). Death, which was brought in by sin, includes eternal perdition (Rev. 20:14). According to His righteousness, God condemned man; hence, man cannot escape death. However, God&rsquo;s plan cannot be accomplished if man must perish. According to His love, God does not want man to perish, and thus, satisfying the requirement of His righteousness is complicated by His love; God&rsquo;s government complicates the fulfillment of His plan. In order for God to solve this problem, He must satisfy both His righteousness and love so that His government and plan are not hindered. God solved this problem by being incarnated as a man in order to be man&rsquo;s Substitute, that is, to bear man&rsquo;s sins and die in man&rsquo;s place. As a man, Jesus Christ was accountable to God&rsquo;s righteousness and suffered the punishment that man should have suffered on account of sin. He satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness for man and fulfilled the desire of God&rsquo;s love for man so that God&rsquo;s government would be upheld and His plan could be accomplished.</p>
<p>In His death on the cross the Lord Jesus bore man&rsquo;s sins; He was punished on behalf of man. He was not crucified as a sacrificial martyr but as our Substitute, bearing our sins and suffering God&rsquo;s righteous punishment on our behalf. In the first three hours of His crucifixion, from 9:00 A.M. to noon, evil men put Him to death, but in the last three hours, from noon to 3:00 P.M., He was punished by God (Mark 15:25; Matt. 27:45). He was punished because He stood in the position of a man, bearing our sins. God caused the iniquity of mankind to fall on Him, to be borne by Him, judging our iniquity in Him (Isa. 53:6b; 1 Pet. 2:24). Therefore, God forsook Him on the cross (Matt. 27:46). Before Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion God had always been with Him (John 16:32). If He had been a martyr, God would have intensified His presence with Him because God delights in martyrs (Acts 7:54-59). But when Christ was on the cross, God forsook Him.</p>
<p>God cannot accept man because of his sinful nature, but the Lord Jesus was without sin. He even said, &ldquo;Which of you convicts Me of sin?&rdquo; (John 8:46). Before He was crucified, He was examined both by the Jewish priests, according to God&rsquo;s law, and the Gentile officials, according to the law of the Roman Empire, but no one could find fault in Him (Luke 23:4, 13-15, 22). He was sinless, but God forsook Him on the cross because He bore our iniquity. In the eyes of God Christ was a sinner on the cross. Although He was sinless and did not know sin, at the cross God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him (Isa. 53:6). God made Him our sin offering and trespass offering so that He could bear our sins on our behalf (v. 10). Hence, God not only forsook Him but also smote Him, afflicted Him, and crushed Him so that He might suffer the pain of death and taste death on our behalf in order that the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness might be fulfilled in us (vv. 4-5; Heb. 2:9). God caused the Righteous to suffer on behalf of the unrighteous so that He could redeem us and make us the righteousness of God (1 Pet. 3:18; Isa. 53:11).</p>
<p>Although Christ did not know sin, God made Him sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21). In God&rsquo;s eyes fallen man is not only sinful but is also constituted with sin. Thus, on the cross the Lord Jesus was also made sin on our behalf. According to God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, not only are we ourselves judged by God but our sins are judged as well. The Lord Jesus was judged by God on the cross because He bore our sins and because He was made sin on our behalf. Our sins were judged by God upon the Lord Jesus, and we were judged by God in Him. Thus, we have been cleansed before God, and we have become the righteousness of God in Christ (v. 21). Because we are sinful and unrighteous, Christ bore our sins so that we could be forgiven by God, and because we are sin itself, Christ was made sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. He bore our sins so that we might receive the forgiveness of sins and be justified by God, and He was made sin on our behalf so that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness and be acceptable to God in Him. This is the first accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ Dealing with Man</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He not only bore man&rsquo;s sins; He also bore our humanity. In His incarnation He put on humanity. He died on the cross as a man; hence, our human nature was crucified with Him. In the eyes of God, when Christ was crucified, He was not alone; we were all crucified with Him (Rom. 6:8). He is the last Adam (5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45). We are included in the first Adam, and his sin is our sin; similarly, we are included in the last Adam, and His death on the cross is our death (Rom. 5:18). Just as we are constituted sinners in the first Adam, we have been crucified in the last Adam. Just as Adam&rsquo;s sin involved all those who are included in him, Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion involved all those who are included in Him. Hence, when Christ was crucified on the cross, we were crucified with Him. His crucifixion was our crucifixion.</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s ark is an example. The ark passed though the flood with Noah&rsquo;s family and the living creatures (Gen. 7). Noah&rsquo;s family and the living creatures passed through the flood with the ark because they were in the ark. This example applies to those who are in Christ. We are joined to Christ; hence, God considers us as being in Christ. God does not see us apart from Christ; He sees us in Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes we died with Christ (Col. 2:20). The Word of God reveals that the flesh, the old man, and the self of those who are in Christ have been crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24). We have been crucified with Christ, and we have died with Him. In addition to our sins, the cross of Christ dealt with our person as well.</p>
<p>Many believers know that the Lord Jesus dealt with their sins on the cross, but they do not know that they also were dealt with on the cross. They know that the Lord died on their behalf, but they do not know that they died with the Lord on the cross. They know about the Lord&rsquo;s vicarious death on the cross but not of their co-crucifixion with Him on the cross. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross was not only a vicarious death; it was also a co-crucifixion. If the Lord had only vicariously died for our sins on the cross, the cross would have dealt only with our sins but not our person. We had to die with Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord died on our behalf, the record of our sins before God was wiped away in order to deliver us from the punishment of sin. When we died with the Lord, our old man was crucified so that we might be delivered from the power of sin (Rom. 6:6). If the Lord had accomplished only a vicarious death and we had not died with Him, we would have been delivered from the punishment of sin but not from the power of sin. We would have been delivered from the result of sin but not the bondage of sin. In other words, the salvation of the Lord&rsquo;s cross would not have been complete. On the cross the Lord accomplished a vicarious death, and we also were crucified with Him. Hence, we can now receive the forgiveness of sins and be delivered from the punishment of sin and from the bondage of sin itself.</p>
<p>Without our co-crucifixion with the Lord on the cross, even His vicarious death would not be effective for us. The Lord brought us into His death so that we might be joined to Him. We can partake of His death because His death is our death, and His death was a substitute for our death. His crucifixion enabled Him to die for us; hence, His dying was our dying. We died with Him; we died in His dying.</p>
<p>May the Lord enlighten us to see that He died a vicarious death on our behalf and that we also died with Him. Just as our sins were dealt with by the Lord on the cross, our person also has been dealt with by the Lord on the cross. How we need to see that our sins were on the cross and that we also were on the cross. Our sins have been judged on the cross, we also have been crucified on the cross.</p>
<p>We must know that we have died with Christ. This does not mean that we will die, but that we have died. We do not need to die in ourselves, because we have died with Christ. We died when Christ died, and we even died where He died. Christ died more than nineteen hundred years ago on the cross at Golgotha, and we also died more than nineteen hundred years ago on the cross at Golgotha. Although we were not yet born, we were included in Christ.</p>
<p>As the Firstborn of all creation, Christ is all-inclusive (Col. 1:15). Therefore, His death is all-inclusive and eternal; it transcends time. All creation is included in Christ. Hence, when Christ died, all creation died with Him and in Him. This is a fact. From our point of view, we are still alive, but from God&rsquo;s point of view, we have died. God considers that we died in Christ, and we also believe that we have died in Christ. Everyone who believes in the Lord is joined to the Lord and needs to be baptized into His death in order to be buried with Him and to terminate the old man and everything related to the old man (Rom. 6:4-6). This is the second accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ Dealing with Satan</h2>
<p>The first creature in the universe to rebel against God and to seek to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan was Satan. He is behind every act of rebellion against God in the universe and is God&rsquo;s adversary. He introduced sin into the world, injected sin into man, and enticed man to commit sins. If the Lord had dealt only with sins and our fallen humanity on the cross, God&rsquo;s enemy would be able to continue to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan unhindered. Therefore, the cross had to deal not only with sins and fallen humanity but also with Satan and everything related to Satan. We need to see that when the Lord dealt with our fallen human nature, He also dealt with the Satan who was in man as well as everything related to Satan.</p>
<p>Satan entered into man when he enticed man to sin. He has been in man since the time of the fall, and his satanic nature is mixed with the fallen human nature. Thus, when the Lord Jesus dealt with man in His death on the cross, He dealt with the Satan who was in man. Before the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He said, &ldquo;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&rdquo; (John 12:31). The ruler of this world is Satan, whose sinful nature is mixed with fallen man and who has usurped fallen man. Our co-crucifixion with the Lord on the cross dealt with the fallen human nature, which is mixed with Satan and usurped by Satan. Hence, the Lord also dealt with Satan, who was mixed with man and who had usurped man. The Bible says that the Lord destroyed Satan through His death on the cross (Heb. 2:14). Seemingly, Satan was victorious when he entered into man by enticing man to sin. However, this was Satan&rsquo;s downfall, because this gave God the opportunity to deal with him. Satan thought that he could trick man and usurp man by indwelling man as sin, but he was ensnared in man and able to be put under God&rsquo;s judgment and destruction. God judged and destroyed Satan in man, whom Satan had tricked and usurped.</p>
<p>We were tricked by Satan into following him to sin and oppose God. However, when we were judged and put to death by God through the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross, Satan was judged and destroyed by God as well, because he dwells in us as sin. Furthermore, the angels under Satan&mdash;the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies&mdash;were also judged and destroyed with Satan by God (Eph. 6:12). When Satan was judged and destroyed, they were judged and destroyed, because he is their ruler and they follow him (2:2; Col. 2:15). Satan and his angels have been dealt with by the cross of Christ. The cross destroyed Satan, the ruler of this darkness, as well as his kingdom of darkness with its rulers and authorities. Not that many believers know this fact, but Satan, his angels, and the demons in his kingdom of darkness are well aware of this matter. We know the power of the Lord&rsquo;s cross when we cast out demons. In spiritual warfare we can overcome Satan when we experience the Lord&rsquo;s cross and His shed blood (Rev. 12:11). Such experiences cause Satan and his angels to fall in shame.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s cross judged and destroyed Satan, and it also judged and destroyed the world ruled by Satan. The God-opposing world is of Satan, and it hangs upon him. Satan has been judged and destroyed by the Lord on the cross; hence, in God&rsquo;s eyes the world that hangs upon him has also been judged and destroyed (John 16:11). Those who have God&rsquo;s view know that the world also has been crucified (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>On the cross the Lord dealt with sins, the old creation, Satan, and the world that Satan rules. When the Lord died on the cross, our sins, our old man, Satan, and the world were judged and dealt with there. On the one hand, the Lord bore our sins and suffered the judgment of death on the cross; on the other hand, He was crucified as a man, having put on humanity. In addition, Satan, who indwells man as sin, and the world, which hangs upon him, were crucified. The Lord&rsquo;s cross dealt with these four matters in the universe. The cross delivers us from sin and our old man, and it also causes us to overcome Satan and the world. This is the third accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ Releasing the Life of God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose in His plan is to work His life into man, but Satan corrupted man by injecting sin into man. Thus, God&rsquo;s purpose was frustrated. In order to accomplish His purpose, God dealt with these two problems&mdash;sin and fallen man&mdash;and also annihilated Satan through the cross of Christ. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s purpose still would not be fulfilled if the cross of Christ only accomplished this much. The cross of Christ dealt with sin and fallen humanity and annihilated Satan on the negative side, but the cross of Christ also released the divine life in Christ on the positive side. Now God&rsquo;s eternal purpose can be accomplished.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He would abide alone unless He fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat, but that if He fell into the ground and died, He would bear much fruit (John 12:24). The Lord is the embodiment of God; the life of God is hidden in Him (Col. 1:19; 2:9), but the life of God that was hidden within Him could only be released through His death. Hence, Christ had to die in order for God&rsquo;s life to be released so that man could receive the life of God.</p>
<p>Many believe that the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross accomplished redemption for our sins and dealt with the problems between man and God, but they do not see the life-releasing aspect, the life-imparting aspect, of the Lord&rsquo;s death. In relation to dealing with the problems between man and God, the Lord&rsquo;s death accomplished redemption for our sins. In relation to accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the Lord&rsquo;s death released the divine life. The life-releasing aspect, the life-imparting aspect, of the Lord&rsquo;s death is typified by Adam&rsquo;s deep sleep. God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took out one of Adam&rsquo;s ribs. Then God built Eve out of the rib that He had taken from Adam&rsquo;s side (Gen. 2:21-22). Similarly, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the Lord Jesus when He died on the cross so that blood and water could flow out of His pierced side (John 19:34). Now the life of God is available to man in order to produce the church.</p>
<p>As a result of His death on the cross, the life within Christ was released to produce many grains of wheat so that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose might be fulfilled. This aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death is for releasing life. One aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death is for redemption. The aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death as a grain of wheat, however, has nothing to do with redemption. Rather, it speaks of the release of the divine life from within Him. When God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, it was not for redeeming Eve but for releasing Adam&rsquo;s life to produce Eve.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was incarnated as a man to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to dispense His life into us so that we may become His many sons, possessing His life, just as the Lord Jesus possesses God&rsquo;s life. The divine life was once confined within the shell of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The Lord went to the cross so that the divine life within the shell of His humanity could be released from within Him. His death on the cross destroyed His human shell so that God&rsquo;s life could be released and then imparted into many through His resurrection to make them sons of God and thus accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. This is the fourth accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the four accomplishments of the Lord on the cross, we know the effectiveness of the cross. On the negative side, the Lord accomplished redemption for our sins, put to death our old man, the flesh, and the self, and annihilated Satan, who defiled us, and the world, which usurped us. On the positive side, the Lord released the life of God so that we might receive this life and become sons of God. Now all the problems in the universe have been dealt with, and God&rsquo;s eternal purpose can be carried out. Now any person can draw near to Christ and be redeemed in order to receive the life of God. Every person can and should let God&rsquo;s eternal purpose be fulfilled in him.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ dealt with sins, the old man, the flesh, Satan, demons, and the world. These things have lost their power, and they no longer are a frustration to the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in us. The eternal life of God was released on the cross of Christ so that we can receive this life in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. All the problems in the universe that existed between man and God have been removed by the cross of Christ, and the living water of the divine life is now flowing for man to receive.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ACCOMPLISHING<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:4, 14, 17; Rom. 1:4; 4:25; 6:8-10; John 10:17-18; 11:25; 14:19-20; 20:17, 19-20, 26-27; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18; Luke 24:13-43; Eph. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; Heb. 2:11-12</h1>
<p>We have seen the first two steps in God&rsquo;s plan of redemption&mdash;the incarnation and the cross of Christ. Now we will consider the third step&mdash;the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The death of Christ accomplished a full redemption and dealt with all our problems, and it fulfilled all God&rsquo;s requirements related to our redemption. Nothing needs to be added to Christ&rsquo;s redemption. However, the resurrection of Christ is still necessary for the effective accomplishments of His death to be applied to us (1 Cor. 15:14). His death redeemed us from our sins and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. His resurrection, however, enables us to receive His life and to be joined with Him, that is, to enter into Him and receive the benefits of His substitutionary death. Through His resurrection we also become the righteousness of God in Him and are acceptable to God (Rom. 4:25; 1 Cor. 15:17; 2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>Although we were included in Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, He can sow the element of His mysterious death into our being only because He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. Although His death destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14), we can experience His overcoming of Satan only because His Satan-overcoming life has entered into us through His resurrection. Although He tasted death for us and nullified death (v. 9; 2 Tim. 1:10), His life has been made available to us only because of His resurrection. Without resurrection His life would not be able to enter into us. We can receive His life, and He can enter into us to be our life so that we may be joined to Him, participate in His death, and experience the accomplishments of His death only because of His resurrection.</p>
<p>If Christ were not resurrected, how could He save us? If He were held by death, how could He give us life? If He could not overcome death, how could He save us out of death? If He could only redeem us from sins but not overcome death, how could He deliver us from the law of sin and of death (Rom. 8:1-2)? If He were not raised from the dead to be designated the Son of God in the power of resurrection, how could people believe that He is the Son of God (1:4), and how could He give people His life and make them sons of God to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal plan? The fulfillment of all these matters depends on His resurrection. Without His resurrection, the fulfillment of these matters would be impossible. His resurrection is essential.</p>
<p>In fact, without the resurrection of Christ we would not even know of His redemption, much less receive His salvation. Without Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, how could we know that He has redeemed us from our sins, that His death has satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, and that God has accepted His redemptive death on our behalf? Without Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead, how could He demonstrate that He tasted death for us, that He destroyed Satan, who had the might of death, and that He nullified death? Christ&rsquo;s resurrection enables us to know these matters. His resurrection is the proof and assurance of these matters. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection enables us to know, believe, and obtain these things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REALITY OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection is a reality, just as His redemptive death is a reality. His death is different from that of every other person. We die because we have committed sins, whereas Christ died to redeem man from sin. We die because we are overcome and held captive by death, whereas Christ died in order to overcome and nullify death. We have no choice other than death, because we are under sin. He died because He was above sin. Except for His desire to redeem us, He could have chosen not to die. We die involuntarily and reluctantly. He died voluntarily and willingly. He willingly died for us and laid down His life for us (John 10:17-18). We die because of sin, and we are subject to the judgment of death and unable to escape. He died for the redemption from sin, and He removed the judgment of sin.</p>
<p>Our sin offends and contradicts God&rsquo;s righteousness; consequently, God&rsquo;s righteousness condemns us to death and puts us to death (Rom. 6:23). Because Christ&rsquo;s redemption fulfilled and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteousness, God delivered Him out of death and raised Him from the dead according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. We are held by death because we have been overcome and captured by death, but Christ died to overcome and nullify death. When He died, He could not be held by death; instead, He came out of death in resurrection (Acts 2:24).</p>
<p>Death is very strong (S. S. 8:6). No one can resist when death comes. Hades collects those who have been taken captive by death (Rev. 6:8); death gains people through sin as a sting (1 Cor. 15:55-56). When people are stung by sin, they fall into the hand of death and are unable to resist. In contrast, the Lord Jesus did not fall into death because of sin. He did not know sin, and He was without sin (2 Cor. 5:21). He was never contaminated by sin. The devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), tempted the Lord to sin and even attempted to put Him to death. However, the Lord overcame him entirely. Satan&rsquo;s intention in tempting the Lord was to put Him to death through sin. However, Satan&rsquo;s temptations were rebuffed by the Lord, and he could not gain anything from the Lord. The Lord caused Satan to have nothing in Him (John 14:30). Satan was unable to inject death into the Lord or put Him to death, as he had done with Adam.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and entered into death in order to do God&rsquo;s will and carry out God&rsquo;s plan to accomplish redemption, deal with sin, nullify death, terminate the old creation, and destroy Satan. He willingly walked into death instead of being captured by death. He determined to nullify death through death voluntarily, instead of being overcome by death and being taken captive by death involuntarily (10:17-18). Acts 2:24 says, &ldquo;Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.&rdquo; When the Lord entered into death, Satan, who has the might of death, must have exhausted all the power of Hades and death to hold Him. Although Satan uses death to hold those who have been taken captive by sin and death, he cannot use death to hold the Lord, who walked into death voluntarily to nullify death through death by the resurrection life in Him.</p>
<p>Satan has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), but the Lord is the Author of life (Acts 3:15). The Lord is the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Although death is strong, it is not stronger than life and resurrection. Life swallows up death, and resurrection overcomes death. The Lord is the resurrection and the life, so it is impossible for Him to be held by death. Instead, He overcame death. Death can hold only those who do not have life; it cannot hold the Lord of life. In His resurrection the Lord broke through death and Hades. His powerful resurrection life caused Him to overcome death, break the hold of death, and resurrect from the dead. He entered into death and walked into Hades in order to save us. After three days He walked out of Hades and was raised from the dead, overcoming death forever because of the great power of His life (1 Cor. 15:3-4). Death cannot lord it over Him (Rom. 6:9; Rev. 1:18).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION AFTER CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus died as a man with a human body, because He put on humanity. When He was resurrected, He still was clothed with humanity and a human body. When the disciples saw Him after His resurrection, they thought that they had seen a spirit, a ghost (Luke 24:37), but He showed them that He still possessed a body with flesh and bones (v. 39), the body that had been crucified on the cross. Although His body had been transfigured into a body of glory by His life through resurrection (Phil. 3:21), the marks from the nails on His hands and feet and from the wound in His side were still present on His body for the disciples to see and touch (John 20:25-27). His body of flesh and bones could also partake of food (Luke 24:39-43). A human body was nailed to the cross, and the Lord Jesus still had a human body after resurrection. In His resurrection He did not put off His human nature. The Lord Jesus put off the aspect of the old creation in His human nature, which had been put on in His incarnation, and He put on the aspect of the new creation in His resurrected human nature. Thus, He brought His redeemed humanity into the new creation of God (2 Cor. 5:14-17).</p>
<p>Just as the Lord became flesh in order to bring God into the humiliation of humanity in the old creation, He died and resurrected to bring redeemed humanity into the glory of God&rsquo;s new creation. Just as He became flesh to bring God to earth so that God could be joined to man to bear the likeness of man, He died and resurrected to bring man to the heavenlies so that man could be joined to God to bear the image of God. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was both God and man; He was man yet God. Now that He is in heaven, He is still both God and man; He is God yet man. After His resurrection He still possesses humanity. Today Christ in heaven has divinity and humanity, just as He did on the earth. His humanity in incarnation was part of the old creation, but now His humanity in resurrection is part of the new creation. He had a body of humiliation, but now He has a glorified body. His divinity was mingled with humanity in incarnation; now His humanity has entered into divinity in resurrection.</p>
<p>Although Christ&rsquo;s resurrected body has a physical form, it is no longer limited by time and space like it was before His resurrection. His body now is in resurrection and in glory. With such a body He can come and go freely at any time and in any place, appearing one moment and disappearing the next. On the day of His resurrection the disciples were in a house with all the doors closed, but He still appeared and stood in their midst (John 20:19). On the road to Emmaus He walked with two disciples, but they did not recognize Him (Luke 24:13-16). They recognized Him only after He entered into a house with them, reclined at table, and broke the bread; then He suddenly disappeared from them (vv. 29-31). These incidents show that Christ has a physical human body after His resurrection that is no longer subject to the limitations of a human body in the old creation. His body has changed in nature and has been transfigured; it has been freed from the slavery and bondage of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of the new creation. We cannot apprehend this freedom in our old-creation body, but He will bring us into the freedom of this glory when He comes again and redeems our body (Rom. 8:21-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Raising Us Up Together with Christ</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished through His death, but the issue of His redemption was brought forth in His resurrection. Furthermore, His resurrection enables us to participate in His redemption. We appropriate and enjoy His redemption in His resurrection. First, His resurrection raised us up together with Him. We were included not only in His death but also in His resurrection (6:8). Just as the people and the living creatures in the ark passed through the waters of the flood (Gen. 7:1-16; 8:13-19), we also passed through death together with Christ and were raised together with Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes we died together with Christ in His death, and we were raised together with Him in His resurrection (Gal. 2:20; Eph. 2:6). We died with Him, and we were raised with Him. By dying with Him, we were delivered from everything that is not of God; by being resurrected with Him, we entered into everything of God. Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we entered into God to enjoy everything of God. Everything of God is our portion in His resurrection.</p>
<p>Because we were resurrected with Christ, we also ascended together with Him. Ephesians 2:6 speaks of our being raised up together with Him and being seated together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. Ascension is related to resurrection. We were earthly people; however, through the resurrection of Christ we not only entered into everything in God but also entered into the heavenly realm to become heavenly people. His death delivered us from a natural, earthly position; His resurrection ushered us into a new, spiritual, heavenly realm. We have attained a heavenly position and enjoy every spiritual blessing in this position. Every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies has became our portion in His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">Justifying Us</h2>
<p>Not only were we under God&rsquo;s condemnation because of our sinful acts, but our very constitution was one of sin (Rom. 3:23; 5:19). Hence, Christ not only bore our sins but also became sin on our behalf on the cross (2 Cor. 5:21). By dying on the cross, He took away our sins and terminated our constitution of sin (Rom. 6:6). When He was raised from the dead and brought us into the new realm of resurrection, we were justified in Him, and we became righteous and acceptable to God (4:25).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death dealt with our sins and our constitution of sin. It terminated our old man, which was under condemnation, and it terminated everything of the old man. It also ended our condemnation before God. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection brought us into a new position by our being justified by God and by becoming the righteousness of God in Him. In His death He bore our sins and became sin on our behalf. In His resurrection we gained Him as our righteousness and became the righteousness of God in Him. In His resurrection He became our righteousness so that we in Him would not only be righteous before God but also become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). He is not only righteous before God, but He is also the righteousness of God. Because we have participated in His resurrection, He has not only become our righteousness to make us righteous before God, but He has also made us the righteousness of God in Him as well.</p>
<p>Righteousness relates to God&rsquo;s procedure and God&rsquo;s law. Only that which is in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure and law is righteous. We used to be contrary to God&rsquo;s law, and our conduct and living were not in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure. Thus, we were unrighteous before God. All our unrighteousness is related to ourselves, and all our righteousness is related to Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death dealt with our unrighteousness, and His resurrection enabled us to enter into Him and to gain Him as our righteousness. His being is absolutely in accord with God&rsquo;s law, and everything related to Him is absolutely in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure. In resurrection He became our righteousness so that we would be in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure and law. His resurrection causes us to be in full accord with God because we are in Him. In the resurrected Christ God sees us as absolutely righteous. In the resurrected Christ we are in absolute accord with God and thus fully acceptable to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Regenerating Us</h2>
<p>The death of the Lord Jesus terminated our fallen human life, whereas His resurrection imparted His eternal divine life into us. Through His resurrection we can partake of His life, which was released from within Him by His death. His resurrection is the source of our regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). The life of God, which was concealed within the Lord Jesus, was released through His death so that it could enter into us through resurrection, thus regenerating us. In His resurrection we were not only saved by God but also born of God. We were not only justified by God but also regenerated by God. We received the Lord Jesus as our righteousness so that we might be acceptable to God, and we received Him as our life so that we might be born of God.</p>
<p>Righteousness is outward, and its emphasis is on our position. Life is inward, and its emphasis is on our disposition. In His resurrection Christ became our righteousness so that we might obtain an acceptable position before God outwardly. He also caused us to receive His life so that we might receive the divine nature of God inwardly. The resurrection of Christ caused us to be justified so that we might have a proper relationship with God, and His resurrection caused us to be regenerated so that we might have a union in life with God. The resurrection of Christ enabled us to meet God&rsquo;s requirement of righteousness, and it also imparted God&rsquo;s nature into us. Because of His resurrection we can come forward to God and even live in God. We can see God&rsquo;s face and partake of His divine nature. We can have fellowship with God, and we can be mingled with God (John 14:20; Gal. 2:20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Entering into Us to Be Our Life</h2>
<p>Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we not only received His life for our regeneration, but we also received Him into us to be our life (Col. 3:3-4). Actually, His life entering into us is just Himself entering into us, because He is life. Through His resurrection He can enter into us to be our life so that we may partake of Him. Through His incarnation He was joined to us, and through His resurrection we were joined to Him. Because He was joined with us in His death by His partaking of blood and flesh, He was able to die on our behalf. Because we are joined with Him in His resurrection by our receiving His life, we can partake of all that He is. His death terminated every negative thing in us, and His resurrection germinated every positive thing in us. His death delivered us from ourselves and everything belonging to us, and because of His resurrection we can receive Him and everything belonging to Him.</p>
<p>Through the death of Christ we no longer have to live by ourselves or as ourselves. Because of His resurrection we can live by Him and live as He lives (John 14:19). He is in us as life, and this life cannot be held by death. Through the power of His resurrection, He delivers us from everything of ourselves and everything belonging to sin and death so that we may experience His death, be conformed to His death, live in Him daily, and be transformed into His image from glory to glory (Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>The death of Christ causes us to put off everything other than Christ; the resurrection of Christ causes us to receive everything that is of Christ. Because of His resurrection He can live in us, and we can live in Him; we are fully joined as one with Him (Rom. 6:5). Since He is in God and one with God, His resurrection has brought us into God and joined us with God. Through His resurrection God can live in us, and we can be joined with God. In His resurrection we are fully joined as one with God.</p><h2 class="head2">Making Us the New Creation</h2>
<p>After the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation, He brought the man whom He had redeemed into the new creation through His resurrection. We were the old creation; His death terminated Adam and everything of Adam. It terminated our old man and old life, that is, what we were in the old creation (v. 6). Then the resurrection of the Lord Jesus caused us to partake of Him and receive His life for regeneration. In this way we were made the new creation: &ldquo;The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>Unlike the old creation, the new creation is not another man who has been created by God with His power but is apart from Him. The new creation is man in union with God, created by God with His life in Himself (Eph. 4:24). The old creation does not have the element of God&rsquo;s life and nature; it has only man&rsquo;s element. The new creation, however, has the element of God&rsquo;s life and nature through the mingling of God and man. The new creation is the redeemed creature mingled with the life of the Creator so that creature and Creator are joined as one.</p>
<p>God has not yet made all things new because the new heaven and the new earth have not yet come, and the New Jerusalem has not yet been manifested (Rev. 21:1-5). However, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection has made us a new creation and the firstfruits of His creatures (2 Cor. 5:17; James 1:18). In this new creation we have been given a foretaste of the manifestation of the New Jerusalem that is full of God&rsquo;s light and life, in which the righteousness of God dwells (2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:23&mdash;22:5). Righteousness dwells in the new creation, and the new creation is full of life and light. In the new creation there is no unrighteousness, death, or darkness; there is only righteousness, life, and light. This is the result of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Us His Brothers</h2>
<p>Originally, the Lord Jesus was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son, (John 1:18; 3:16), the One who had God&rsquo;s life and bore God&rsquo;s expression. According to His eternal plan, however, God desires that many would have the life of His Son, become His sons, and receive the sonship. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus fulfilled this purpose in God&rsquo;s plan. Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection God regenerated us so that we would have His life and become His many sons. Originally God had only one Son, the only begotten Son, but through His resurrection Christ became the Firstborn among many brothers, the many sons who were regenerated through His resurrection (Rom. 8:29; 1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus died, He called His disciples friends (John 15:15), but on the morning of His resurrection He called them brothers (Matt. 28:10). This is because His resurrection caused the disciples to receive His life and become His brothers and God&rsquo;s sons. Just as God is the Father of the Lord Jesus, He is also the Father of the Lord&rsquo;s brothers (John 20:17). On the day of His resurrection the life of the Son of God entered into the disciples, and they received the divine life. Thus, they were all of One. This is the reason that He is not ashamed to call them brothers (Heb. 2:11).</p>
<p>At first, the Lord Jesus was the only grain, but now He has borne &ldquo;much fruit&rdquo; (John 12:24). This fruit is the same as He is in life and nature. Originally, He was the only begotten Son of God; now He is the Firstborn among many brothers. Originally, He alone had the life of God and was able to know God (Matt. 11:27); now He can declare the name of God to His many brothers and lead them to know God because they have the same divine life. He has entered into glory (Luke 24:26), and He will lead His many brothers, God&rsquo;s many sons, into glory as well.</p>
<p>The resurrection of the Lord brings us to a point where we are exactly the same as He is, having the life of God in order to express God. We are sons of God with Him; we are His brothers and partners. The sonship that we received in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection is the top blessing in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Us the Church</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:12 says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo; This verse is quoted from Psalm 22:22. In this psalm the Spirit of Christ describes through the mouth of David the sufferings of Christ&rsquo;s death. The words quoted in Hebrews 2:12 from this psalm are spoken in the context of the resurrection of Christ. This verse shows that the brothers, produced by Christ in His resurrection, are the church. Individually speaking, those who were regenerated in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection are His brothers; collectively speaking, they are the church, His Body.</p>
<p>Just as Eve was brought forth when Adam was awakened from his sleep (Gen. 2:21-22), the church was produced when Christ was resurrected from the dead. He is the grain of wheat that died and has grown to become many grains (John 12:24). Collectively, the many grains are the church, the corporate expression of Christ. In incarnation the life of God entered into one person, Jesus the Nazarene, through whom God was expressed. Through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection the life of God entered into many people, through whom God is expressed corporately. This corporate entity is the church, which is composed of those who have received God&rsquo;s life through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. We are the church because of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Christ produced the church with His life through His resurrection. The church was produced in the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST FULFILLING<br />
THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection brought about the positive aspects of God&rsquo;s redemption. Although Christ&rsquo;s death accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption, His death mainly dealt with the negative aspects of our problems before God. The resurrection of Christ, however, allowed God to fulfill His plan and attain His positive goal. The death of Christ is the foundation of His redemption and the basis for His resurrection, but the accomplishments of His death were made effective and real to us through His resurrection. Therefore, a person who desires to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation must believe in His resurrection (Rom. 10:9). When we testify for the Lord, we also must testify concerning His resurrection (Acts 1:22; 2:32; 3:15; 4:33).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APPLICATION OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 16:7, 13-16; 14:16-20</h1>
<p>In chapter 6 we said that Christ accomplished redemption through His death in the flesh on the cross according to God&rsquo;s eternal plan. In chapter 7 we said that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection proves and confirms His accomplishment on the cross and also brings redeemed humanity into the status of the new creation. Through His death and resurrection all the requirements for us to be saved have been fulfilled. However, the accomplishments of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection could not be applied to us if He had merely resurrected from the dead. In order for these accomplishments to reach us and become our experience, Christ had to become the Spirit.</p>
<p>Only the Spirit can reach us and enter into us. Only the Spirit can cause us to receive the redemption accomplished by God. Only the Spirit can bring what was accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection into us to become our spiritual experience and reality. The goal of God&rsquo;s redemption is for man to receive Him as life so that God and man may be fully mingled as one. This can be accomplished only by the Spirit. Only the Spirit can enter into man and enable man to receive God as everything so that God and man may be joined as one. Redemption can be applied to man only in the Spirit, and the goal of God&rsquo;s redemption can be attained only in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION BEING APPLIED IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to accomplish redemption, it was not sufficient for God to be incarnated. He had to take a further step and become the Spirit in order to apply His redemption. God accomplished redemption as a man in the flesh, but as a man in the flesh, He could not apply redemption. As a man in the flesh, He could accomplish redemption for man objectively, but He could not apply it to man subjectively so that it would become man&rsquo;s practical salvation. As a man in the flesh, Christ could accomplish the fact of redemption for man, but He could not enable man to experience this salvation. As long as Christ was a man in the flesh, His accomplishments could not be applied to man. In order for His accomplishments to be applied to man, Christ had to become the Spirit.</p>
<p>The objective aspect of redemption was accomplished by God as a man in the flesh. The subjective aspect of redemption is accomplished by God as the Spirit. God was incarnated in order to accomplish the objective aspect of redemption, and He became the Spirit in order to make the subjective experience of redemption real to redeemed humanity. Without His becoming flesh, there would not be the fact of redemption. However, without His becoming the Spirit after accomplishing redemption, there would be no experience of salvation. The experience of salvation is the subjective application of redemption, which is received through the Spirit. In other words, the fact of redemption, which was accomplished by God as a man in the flesh, becomes our experience of salvation in the Spirit. The fact of redemption from sins becomes our experience of forgiveness of sins in the Spirit. The fact of His being put to death on the cross becomes our experience of co-crucifixion with Him in the Spirit. His resurrection life becomes the life that enlivens us and the life by which we live in the Spirit. His being our righteousness, our sanctification, and the redemption of our body in the future are realized by us in the Spirit. In the Spirit, God&rsquo;s redemption and all that is of Him are applied to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD GOING AND THE SPIRIT COMING</h2>
<p>After accomplishing redemption, the Lord Jesus needed to go in order to come again. He had to go in order for the Spirit to come. In John 16:7 the Lord said, &ldquo;If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you.&rdquo; This means that the Spirit could not come as long as the Lord remained on the earth as a man in the flesh. Furthermore, the Lord would not have been able to apply His accomplished redemption to man, which causes man to receive salvation. His redemption must be applied by the Spirit in order for man to receive His salvation. Hence, the Spirit had to come. However, in order for the Spirit to come, the Lord had to go. Through His going, He was able to send the Spirit (v. 7). His going enabled the Spirit to come and ensured that the Spirit would come.</p>
<p>The coming of the Spirit was the coming of the Lord Himself. In 14:17 the Lord said, &ldquo;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>He</em> refers to the Spirit, who would come to abide with the disciples. In verse 18 the Lord continued, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>I</em> refers to the Lord, who would come to be with the disciples. &ldquo;He&rdquo; in verse 17 is &ldquo;I&rdquo; in verse 18. When the Lord told His disciples that He would not leave them as orphans, He told them of His coming as the Spirit to abide in them.</p>
<p>Hence, in verse 19 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Lord would go away in the flesh and return as the Spirit in order to enter into the disciples so that they might live as He lived. Then they would know that the Lord was in them and that they were in the Lord (v. 20). In 16:16 He said to the disciples, &ldquo;A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me,&rdquo; because He was going away in the flesh and coming again as the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">COMING AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>On the morning of the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven. In the evening on that same day He came back as the Spirit and breathed into the disciples, telling them to receive the Holy Spirit (20:17-22). From that time onward, the Lord led the disciples to know Him as the Spirit. As the Spirit, He was no longer limited by time and space like He was when He was with them in the flesh. Then on the day of Pentecost He poured out the Holy Spirit from heaven upon the disciples. The disciples were now filled inwardly and outwardly with the Holy Spirit. They were mingled with the Holy Spirit and could enjoy all that the Lord had accomplished (Acts 2:1-4).</p>
<p>The Lord went into death as a man on the cross in order to accomplish redemption, and He came as the Spirit in order to apply His accomplished redemption. Everything that He accomplished in the flesh is in the Spirit to be applied to us. He went as a man, and He came again as the Spirit so that all His accomplishments in the flesh could be applied to us. In the Spirit we can contact and receive all that the Lord accomplished.</p>
<p>We receive the Lord in the Spirit. When He was in the flesh, He could be contacted, but He could not be received by man. Even though He was among man, He could not enter into man. He could render help to man, but He could not enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and everything. God was incarnated to be the man Jesus Christ, and now the Lord is the Spirit, who is God (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17). Just as everything of God is in Christ, everything of Christ is in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE TRANSFIGURATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of God, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ. Christ is the image of God, and the Spirit is Christ in another form. Christ is the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3), and the Spirit is the reality of Christ (John 14:17-20). The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9), and all that Christ is and has is in the Spirit (John 16:13-15). God is manifested in Christ (1:18), and Christ is revealed in the Spirit (15:26). God was embodied in Christ in order to be among man, to be seen by man, and to be contacted by man. Christ was transfigured in His resurrection as the Spirit in order to enter into man and to be received by man. God was embodied in Christ in order to be man&rsquo;s Savior, and Christ was transfigured as the Spirit in order to become man&rsquo;s salvation. Just as man needs to know Christ in order to know God, man needs to know the Spirit in order to know Christ. Just as man cannot find God outside of Christ, man cannot touch Christ apart from the Spirit. Just as man must be in Christ in order to contact God (14:6), man must be in the Spirit in order to experience Christ. A person must receive Christ in order to receive God, and a person must receive the Spirit in order to receive Christ. A person who does not believe in Christ does not believe in God, and a person who does not have the Spirit does not have Christ. He who is unto Christ is unto God, and he who belongs to the Spirit belongs to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING GOD&rsquo;S CONSUMMATE FORM</h2>
<p>As the eternal Father who dwells in unapproachable light (Isa. 9:6; 1 Tim. 6:16), God cannot be contacted. However, He desires to have a relationship with man. Therefore, He came out of unapproachable light in incarnation: He became flesh, revealing Himself in humanity. He had the form of man in order to be near men and to be contacted by men. God was manifested in the Son (John 1:18), Jesus Christ, in order to be among men and to contact men. He put on a body of blood and flesh; He possessed the human life, nature, and image; and He was exactly the same as man yet without sin (Heb. 4:15). In the form of a man He tasted everything of human life, and on behalf of man He accomplished everything needed for man to have a relationship with Him. However, as a man in the flesh, He could not enter into man, be received by man, or become man&rsquo;s everything in order for man to be joined with Him. Therefore, through death and resurrection He became the Spirit&mdash;He changed His form&mdash;so that He might contact man. The Spirit is God&rsquo;s consummate form in His relationship with man. As the Spirit, He can be contacted, and He can also enter into man and be gained by man. Hence, man may have His life, nature, and image and thus be joined with Him as one, just as He put on humanity and was joined with man, having the human life, nature, and image.</p>
<p>Just as the God who dwells in unapproachable light cannot be contacted by man, the God who was incarnated as a man in the flesh could not be received by man. Light is a limiting factor in eternity, and the flesh was a limiting factor in time and space. The light limits His contact with man because of His glory, and the flesh limited His contact with man because of His physical body. In order to be among men, He had to break through the limiting factor of His dwelling in unapproachable light in glory. Likewise, in order to enter into man, He had to break through the limiting factor of the flesh.</p>
<p>Although God came out from unapproachable light in order to be in the midst of man and to be contacted by man, He was limited in the flesh and not able to enter into man to be received by man. When He was incarnated, He broke through the limiting factor of His glory, but He entered into the limiting factor of the flesh. Hence, He had to go through death and resurrection in order to break through the physical limitation of the flesh and enter into spiritual freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). In order to be received by man, He had to come to man in another form. In His first coming He was incarnated as the man Jesus Christ. In His second coming to man on the day of His resurrection, He was the omnipresent Spirit. This is His second form. The Spirit is the consummate form of God in His appearing to man. As the Spirit, God has attained His purpose in man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING ALL SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2>
<p>As the transfiguration of Christ and God&rsquo;s consummate form, every spiritual reality is in the Spirit. The Lord Jesus referred to the Spirit as &ldquo;the Spirit of reality&rdquo; (John 14:17). God is in Christ, and Christ has been transfigured as the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is every spiritual reality. All that God is and has is in Christ, and Christ is the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the reality of all that God is in Christ. Because God is in Christ and Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is all spiritual reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of God and the reality of Christ. Hence, the Lord referred to the Spirit as the Spirit of reality and also said that this Spirit would guide us into all the reality (16:13). <em>All the reality</em> refers to everything that God is in Christ, that is, everything that God desires to impart into us and for us to gain in Christ. The Lord Jesus is the reality (14:6), and reality came through Him (1:17). He became a man for the purpose of bringing reality to man. In order for man to receive this reality, it must be applied through the Spirit; that is, the Lord had to become the Spirit. Hence, the Lord brought reality with Him, and when He was transfigured into the Spirit, He became the Spirit of reality to guide us into all the reality.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of all spiritual matters. Every spiritual matter is in the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have every spiritual matter, but without the Spirit, we do not have spiritual reality. When the Spirit is present, reality is present, and when the Spirit is absent, reality is absent. With the Spirit everything is real, but without the Spirit everything is merely doctrine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT GOD IS AND HAS BEING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
FOR MAN TO RECEIVE</h2>
<p>All that God is and all that He has are given to man in Christ and received by man in the Spirit. Everything that God is and has can be given to man only in Christ. However, in order for man to receive God, Christ had to become the Spirit. God has sent the Spirit into the world to reach all those who would believe in the Lord so that the Spirit can enter into man and be received by man.</p>
<p>The Spirit is like radio waves in the air. When we tune a radio to a specific frequency, we can receive the sound being emitted through the radio waves. In the Spirit we can contact, receive, and experience all that God is and has and all that Christ is and has accomplished. We can contact God only in the Spirit, and we can believe in, receive, and experience Christ only in the Spirit. Every spiritual experience can be received in the Spirit because God and all that He is and has are in the Spirit.</p>
<p>God was incarnated as a man, Jesus Christ, in order to be manifested in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us. In resurrection Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, was transfigured as the Spirit in order to come into us. Hence, at any time and in any place God is able to work Himself and all His accomplishments into us so that we can receive Him, be joined to Him, and become one with Him. The manifestation of God in the flesh is precious, but Christ&rsquo;s coming as the Spirit is more real to us. The early disciples knew the preciousness of God&rsquo;s presence in the flesh, but only later did they recognize the value of His presence as the Spirit of reality (Acts 1:3-4, 8). May we not only value the manifestation of God in the flesh but also appreciate His coming as the Spirit of reality. God is waiting for us to receive and enjoy everything that He is and has for us in the Spirit of reality.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">FAITH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:11-12; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROOF OF GOD&rsquo;S ACCOMPLISHED REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that God accomplished redemption in Christ. God became flesh and put on humanity, but not the sin associated with fallen humanity, so that He could enter into a practical union with man. In His status as a man in the flesh, Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross, bore man&rsquo;s sins, and brought humanity with Him to the cross. Through His all-inclusive death, He solved all the problems in the universe. He dealt with the sins committed by man and with the sin-committing man himself; that is, He dealt with man&rsquo;s sinful deeds and man&rsquo;s sinful nature. He also dealt with Satan and the world. Through the death of Christ on the cross, God dealt with everything that falls short of His glory and does not correspond to His righteousness and holiness so that He might be gracious to man and enable man to contact Him.</p>
<p>Through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, God redeemed fallen man and released the life of God, which He desires to give to man. He caused man to turn to Him and to receive His life. Furthermore, Christ resurrected from the dead, ascended into heaven, and entered into glory with His humanity. Through His resurrection and ascension, humanity was brought into God and into God&rsquo;s glory; thus, redeemed man can enter into a practical union with God. Now God is fully joined with man, and man is joined with Him. God entered into humanity, and He brought humanity into Himself. Through His death, resurrection, and ascension all that God is and has can be wrought into man, and man can be brought into God; hence, God and man can be joined as one. This is marvelous and mysterious. Through His death, resurrection, and ascension Christ, who is God yet man, was glorified; He brought humanity into glory. This is the glorious mystery of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s entering into glory is the proof of God&rsquo;s accomplished redemption (Luke 24:26; Rom. 4:25). The person in glory in the heavens is both God and man; He is man yet God, and God yet man. The resurrection of Christ from the dead signaled the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan by issuing in a person who is God mingled with man and man joined with God. This is the result that God intended to obtain in eternity past, and it is the issue of His work in time. Hence, God&rsquo;s heart is full of joy. </p>
<p>A person who sets up a factory to mass-produce a certain product must first produce a prototype. After he has successfully produced a prototype, he can begin to mass-produce the prototype. Being able to produce a prototype is something worth cheering and rejoicing over. The resurrected and glorified Christ, who is God yet man, is the prototype of God&rsquo;s redemptive work. He is the issue of God&rsquo;s redemptive work. God can now work to mass-produce Christ as the prototype.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemptive work was accomplished in Christ, but He is only a prototype; He is not the mass production. God&rsquo;s intention is not to gain just one person who is joined with Him but to gain myriads of people who are joined with Him. He desires to gain many who are like Christ and who are one with Him in Christ. God wants many to have all that Christ is and has so that Christ may have many brothers as His partners and may be the firstborn Son, having the first place among many brothers for the expression of God&rsquo;s glory. Hence, all that Christ is and has accomplished is now in the Spirit for us to receive and obtain.</p>
<p>If the redemption accomplished in Christ could not have been applied to and appropriated by others, His work would have been limited to the production of only a prototype; that is, there would have been no mass production of God&rsquo;s redemptive work in us. In order for there to be a mass production of Christ, He became the Spirit to be received by those who believe (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). Therefore, after accomplishing redemption, everything of Christ was received in the Spirit to be applied to man (John 16:15).</p>
<p>Without Christ becoming the Spirit, the redemption accomplished by God could not reach us. The accomplishments of redemption must be in the Spirit in order to reach us. All of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments are objective facts, but they must be applied to us in the Spirit so that they can be gained and enjoyed by us as our inward, subjective experiences. Hence, God&rsquo;s redemption is not merely an outward accomplishment in Christ for us; it is the salvation that God desires to inwardly apply to us in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is omnipresent, invisible, and intangible; He is not limited by space, time, or matters. Everything that God has accomplished in Christ is in the Spirit in order to be applied to us. Everything that God has accomplished in Christ is in the Spirit for us to receive. God is waiting for man to receive all that He has accomplished. Therefore, when we believe and receive God&rsquo;s redemption, the Spirit applies Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments to us so that they become the salvation that is gained, experienced, and enjoyed by us. By believing and receiving, we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APPROPRIATION OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Redemption was accomplished by Christ and is applied to man in the Spirit. Man needs only to believe and receive it. Formerly, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, fallen man was not permitted to contact God and could not receive His life. This is signified by the cherubim and the flaming sword, which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). However, Christ&rsquo;s redemption fulfilled the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, met the standard of God&rsquo;s holiness, and satisfied the expression of God&rsquo;s glory so that man can freely contact God and receive His life.</p>
<p>The requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory closed the way to the tree of life. But Christ&rsquo;s redemption satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory; hence, the way to God as the tree of life has been opened, and a new and living way has been initiated for man to boldly contact God (Heb. 10:19-22). In Christ and through Christ&rsquo;s redemption man can now contact God and receive His life. God is in Christ for man to receive. By believing and receiving the Lord Jesus Christ, man can receive the life of God, the eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FAITH APPROPRIATING GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION,<br />
DELIVERING MAN, AND GIVING HIM LIFE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention was for man to receive His life, but Satan caused man to fall into sin and thus brought in various problems. Hence, God accomplished redemption in Christ to solve the problems brought in by Satan and to release His life. As a result, a person who believes in Christ receives and appropriates redemption by faith. He is forgiven of his sins and delivered from the problems brought in by sin so that he can receive God&rsquo;s life. If a person desires to be freed from the problems brought in by sin and to have the eternal life of God, he must believe in the redemption that God accomplished in Christ. When we appropriate Christ&rsquo;s redemption by faith, we receive the issue of His redemption; that is, we are delivered from the problems brought in by sin, and we receive the eternal life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SON OF GOD THROUGH FAITH<br />
TO APPROPRIATE GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The faith that appropriates God&rsquo;s redemption is not merely a matter of understanding the doctrine of God&rsquo;s redemption, nor is it merely a matter of receiving the redemption accomplished by God in Christ. The faith that appropriates God&rsquo;s redemption is a matter of believing into the Son of the living God and of receiving the Lord of life. God accomplished redemption for man, and His life is in Christ for man to receive. Man must believe in Christ and have a relationship with Christ by being joined by faith to Him in order to participate in redemption. Furthermore, redemption is related to the Son, and God&rsquo;s life is in the Son. Therefore, man must receive Christ in order to obtain the life of God. Only by receiving Christ can man be redeemed and have the life of God. Faith delivers man from the problems brought in by sin and gives man the eternal life of God (1 John 5:10-12). This faith also enables man to obtain God&rsquo;s salvation of life.</p>
<p>The faith that enables man to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption and to obtain God&rsquo;s salvation does not depend on how much man understands the doctrine of redemption. This faith depends only on whether man receives Christ and has a living relationship, a relationship in life, with Him. Without the Son of God, the doctrine of redemption is empty, dead knowledge, which cannot enable us to receive life or have the salvation of life. Life is in the Son. He alone is the Lord of life who can give life to us. Therefore, we must receive Him by faith in order to have His life and His living salvation. Without faith a person cannot be saved. A person&rsquo;s salvation depends on whether he has faith. Such faith receives the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
ISSUING IN FAITH FOR APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Having faith that appropriates God&rsquo;s redemption is an issue of contacting the Spirit. The redemption that Christ accomplished is made real to us when we touch the Spirit. Consequently, God sends the Spirit to move us so that we may have living faith to receive redemption. The Spirit not only brings redemption to man but also moves man to believe and receive redemption. The Spirit follows the word of the gospel of God. On the one hand, the Spirit moves man to believe in the gospel of God, and on the other hand, He brings the reality of redemption into man&rsquo;s spirit. A person who is moved by the Spirit and believes in the gospel of God receives and obtains redemption by faith. This is what it means to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption in the Spirit and through the Spirit.</p>
<p>Only faith that comes from the moving of the Spirit, faith that comes from the Spirit and is in the Spirit, can enable man to obtain God&rsquo;s salvation and to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption. The Spirit enters into man through the gospel and makes everything in God&rsquo;s redemption real for man to contact and receive. The items in God&rsquo;s redemption include forgiveness of sins, the vicarious death of Christ, our co-crucifixion with Him, and the release of the divine life. Unless the Spirit makes these items real to us, they are but empty doctrines. If redemption were only a matter that we need to comprehend with our mind, we would never touch the reality of redemption in our spirit. God&rsquo;s redemption must become more than a doctrine to comprehend with our mind. It must become a spiritual reality that we can touch and receive in our spirit. The doctrine of redemption can affect our mind, but it cannot regenerate our spirit. Hence, the doctrine of redemption alone cannot result in our salvation. The Spirit must convert the doctrine of redemption into a spiritual reality. Only then can we obtain God&rsquo;s salvation and be transformed in life from our spirit.</p>
<p>Our salvation does not depend on how much we understand the gospel or comprehend the doctrine of redemption. Our salvation depends on whether our spirit contacts the Spirit and we touch the reality of redemption. Understanding the gospel and comprehending the doctrine of redemption with the mind may be likened to an outward activity of installing electric lamps. Contacting the Spirit with the human spirit in order to touch the reality of redemption can be likened to electricity flowing in the electric lamps. In order for an electric lamp to shine, it must be connected to electricity. This principle applies to believing in the gospel. A person cannot be saved if he only receives the doctrine of redemption in his mind. He must touch the reality of redemption in his spirit in order to obtain life and have salvation. Consequently, a person must contact the Spirit. The doctrine of the gospel can only give a person a dead faith, but contacting the Spirit causes man to have living faith. Knowledge of the items of the Christian faith cannot cause us to be saved. Only a living faith, a faith that is produced through contacting Christ as life, can cause us to have the salvation of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPROPRIATING GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION<br />
TO BE IN UNION WITH GOD</h2>
<p>The goal of God&rsquo;s redemption is for man to be joined with God. Hence, the issue of appropriating God&rsquo;s redemption is union with God. God&rsquo;s redemption dealt with sin and destroyed Satan, but these are not His goal. God&rsquo;s goal is for us to obtain His life and to be joined with Him. By appropriating God&rsquo;s redemption, we can receive forgiveness of sins and overcome Satan, but these are not the focus of redemption. The focus of God&rsquo;s redemption is for us to obtain God&rsquo;s life and be joined with Him. Redemption dealt with our sins and destroyed Satan in order to remove the obstacles and problems that frustrate us from obtaining God&rsquo;s life and being joined with Him. God forgives our sins and justifies us so that we may obtain His life and be joined with Him. Therefore, although God&rsquo;s redemption has done many things for us, His ultimate goal is to redeem us back to Himself so that we may be joined with Him. We can obtain many blessings by appropriating God&rsquo;s redemption, but the most important item is for us to obtain God&rsquo;s life and be joined with Him.</p>
<p>Our appropriating of God&rsquo;s redemption by faith issues in our salvation. The central meaning of salvation is to obtain God&rsquo;s life and be joined with Him. God&rsquo;s life is in Christ, and Christ has been transfigured as the Spirit so that He may enter into us. When we contact the Holy Spirit by faith, we receive Christ, and the Spirit begins to make Christ real in us. As a result, we can obtain Christ&rsquo;s life, that is, obtain Christ as life, so that we may be joined with Christ as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). When we obtain the life of Christ, we obtain the life of God, and when we are joined with Christ, we are joined with God.</p>
<p>When we are saved and joined with Christ, we can participate in all that Christ possesses. Christ&rsquo;s death becomes our death, His resurrection becomes our resurrection, and His ascension becomes our ascension. Through our union with Christ, His experience becomes our history. What He is and what He has obtained become ours. In Him we have died and resurrected. In Him we are sitting in the heavenlies. In Him we are sons of God. He is one with the Father, and in Him we also are one with the Father (John 17:21). Because we are joined with Christ, we are also joined with the Father. This is the goal of God&rsquo;s redemption, and this is the issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONSECRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Rom. 6:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STEP IN APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION&mdash;FAITH</h2>
<p>We appropriate the redemption that God has accomplished in Christ for us through faith. Once we believe, that is, receive the Lord by believing, we obtain God&rsquo;s redemption. Hence, believing is the first step toward appropriating God&rsquo;s redemption. In this step we turn from being sinners to being believers, from being worldly to being sanctified, from being in darkness to being in light, and from being in death to being in life. This is a great step.</p>
<p>Even though this is a great step, it is not complete. This step merely causes us to receive, not to enjoy, God&rsquo;s redemption. Although believing imparts God&rsquo;s life into us, it is not enough to cause this life to grow in us. After we receive God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s life, we need a further step to enjoy His redemption so that His life may grow in us. Thus, there is a need for another step to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP IN APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION&mdash;CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>The second step in the appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is consecration. Once we receive God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s life by faith, we must consecrate ourselves to God to enjoy His redemption so that His life can grow in us. We must take the steps of faith and consecration in order to receive and enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption, that is, to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption fully.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Consecration</h2>
<p>To believe is to receive God and everything of God, and to consecrate is to hand over ourselves and everything to God. Receiving is by believing; handing over is by love. When we believe, we receive everything that God has accomplished and prepared for us in Christ by faith. When we consecrate, we hand over ourselves and our everything to God because of love. By faith we receive God and everything of God; that is, we receive God&rsquo;s redemption. By handing over ourselves in love we enjoy God and everything of God; that is, we enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Consecration</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to conform us to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). God accomplishes this purpose by working the life of His Son into us through the Spirit. He works in us so that His life will grow in us unto maturity, and we will fully bear the image of His Son. Ephesians 2:10 says, &ldquo;We are His masterpiece.&rdquo; This speaks of God&rsquo;s work in us, not of our doing anything for Him. After we receive His life through redemption, God does a work of life in us so that His life will grow in us unto maturity, and we will have His image fully. However, in order for Him to work in us, He must have our consent, which is our consecration. Our consecration is our giving Him the consent to work in us as He pleases.</p>
<p>Carpenters who work on wood and craftsmen who work on various materials have no need of consent from lifeless materials. Such materials have no consciousness or opinions. But God cannot work in us without our consent, because we have the highest form of created life. We are persons who have consciousness, opinions, preferences, and choices. If we do not want God to work in us and do not consent to let Him work in us, He will be restricted in His work in us. As living persons, we have deep emotions and a strong will. Consequently, if our will does not allow God to work in us or if our emotions do not accept God&rsquo;s work in us, God will have no way in us. After our salvation our consent is needed in order for God to work in us. Our consent is our handing over ourselves to Him completely and our letting Him work in us freely. This is consecration.</p>
<p>Many people think that consecration is related to our working for God; this is preached quite often. However, the primary meaning of consecration is not that we would work for God but instead that we would let God work in us. God is responsible for everything in His plan of redemption. God has done some things for us, but He desires to do still more things in us. In order to receive the things that God has done, we need faith. However, in order to receive the things that God still desires to do in us, we need to consent to His work in us through consecration. In our believing we receive what God has done for us; in our consecration we allow God to do what He still wants to do in us. If we do not believe, we cannot receive what He has done for us, and if we do not consecrate ourselves, we are not letting Him do what He wants to do in us. If we believe but do not consecrate ourselves, we will receive what He has done for us, but He will be unable to do what He still wants to do. Hence, after we believe and receive what He has done for us, He wants us to consecrate ourselves so that He may continue to work in us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Motivation of Consecration</h2>
<p>After we are saved, God draws and constrains us with His love so that we would love Him and willingly consecrate ourselves to Him. When we are constrained by His love, He can work in us as He pleases. We can consecrate ourselves only if we have been drawn and constrained by His love. If we have been drawn and constrained by God&rsquo;s love, our only response will be to love Him and to consecrate ourselves to Him. If we have been drawn and constrained by God&rsquo;s love, we will love God, and if we have been touched and captured by God&rsquo;s love, we will consecrate ourselves to God. Once we consecrate ourselves to God, He has an opportunity to work in us. God reveals His love to us so that we would sense His love and be drawn and constrained by His love.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John shows that the Lord wants us to believe in Him and then love Him. Believing in Him causes us to receive Him as life (3:15, 36; 6:40, 47); loving Him causes us to live out His life through His working in us (14:21, 23; 15:10). If we believe in Him but do not love Him, the life that we have received from Him will not grow in us or work in us so that we would be conformed to His image and express Him. Hence, we must love Him as well as believe in Him. Chapter 21 records the story of the Lord leading Peter to love Him. Although Peter believed in the Lord, he was short in loving the Lord; thus, after the Lord resurrected and ascended, He came back to lead Peter to love Him more so that Peter would allow the Lord&rsquo;s life to work in him according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire (vv. 15-17).</p>
<p>The maiden in Song of Songs represents every believer, and her pursuit illustrates a loving pursuit that gives the Lord an opportunity to do an inward work in her. Her pursuit comes from receiving a revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s love and from being drawn by the Lord&rsquo;s love. The maiden&rsquo;s pursuit of her beloved, who represents the Lord, and her interactions with the beloved are the result of being drawn by his love. Our loving the Lord gives Him an opportunity to work Himself into us until we are full of His stature. If we want the Lord to work in us, we must be like the maiden and receive a revelation of His love and be drawn by His love to pursue Him. No one can pursue the Lord without being drawn by His love. Only those who pursue the Lord in love will give Him an opportunity to work in them so that they may grow in life unto maturity. We must be drawn by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us... that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This word shows that Paul had been constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love; thus, he could count all things as loss and fully pursue the Lord (Phil. 3:8, 12). The Lord caused Paul not only to have faith but also to love Him (1 Tim. 1:14). Paul&rsquo;s faith toward the Lord enabled him to receive the Lord and the Lord&rsquo;s life; his love toward the Lord enabled him to consecrate himself to the Lord, to let the Lord work in him so that the Lord&rsquo;s life would grow in him unto maturity. Paul was filled with the Lord, and he wanted the Lord to be formed in him so that his living might be Christ (Phil. 1:21). He was full of the Lord&rsquo;s stature because the Lord&rsquo;s love motivated him to love the Lord and to consecrate himself so that the Lord could gain him and work in him as He pleased. His love toward the Lord was the result of being constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love. The Lord constrained Paul with love so that he could be gained by the Lord and let the Lord be worked fully into him.</p>
<p>Receiving by believing enables us to gain the Lord; consecrating because of love enables the Lord to gain us. The Lord must gain us in order to work in us. Only a consecration out of love will enable the Lord to gain us. Hence, the Lord constrains us with His love in order to produce a response in us to love Him, to consecrate ourselves to Him, and to let Him work in us. The Gospels show that the Lord led His disciples to believe in Him before His death and to love Him after His resurrection. The Acts and the Epistles show that the Lord led the disciples to believe and love Him so that He would have an opportunity to work in them and make all that He is available to them as the Spirit. Because the disciples were drawn by the Lord&rsquo;s love, they loved and followed the Lord and let Him work in them as He pleased. The disciples&rsquo; experience applies to all who have followed the Lord throughout the ages. Hence, we must be drawn and touched by the Lord&rsquo;s love in order to willingly consecrate ourselves to Him. We must be touched and constrained by His love to such an extent that we could only consecrate ourselves to Him and never flee from Him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Issue of Consecration</h2>
<p>Once we have been touched by the Lord&rsquo;s love and have consecrated ourselves to Him, the Lord&rsquo;s life, which is the Lord Himself, immediately gains the ground to operate in us, to gradually work everything of the Lord into us. Once we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s life gains the ground to develop and grow in us and to remove every unrighteous, unholy, or improper thing in us so that we may be transformed until we are fully like Him.</p>
<p>Our consecration allows the Lord to work in us. The Lord is waiting for us to give Him the ground. Once we willingly hand ourselves over and consent to let Him work in us, His life will operate in us and give us a sense that we must separate ourselves from this thing or put away another thing. The Lord will give us a sense related to everything that is incompatible with His life or does not please Him. If we are willing to obey this sense, the Lord will remove these things one by one according to the power of His life. This will not come about by outward, doctrinal teaching but by the operation of the might of His life in us. His life is righteous, holy, bright, and divine. When He has the ground, He will remove little by little everything in us that is unrighteous, unholy, dark, or apart from God. From the center of our being, He will spread outward to the circumference of our being step by step. Eventually, with light He will efface everything in us that is dark, and by life He will swallow up everything in us that is dead. In this process we will be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>A genuine and proper consecration gives the Lord&rsquo;s life the ground to operate and spread in us by letting Him work in us. As long as we are faithful and remain in our consecration, giving the Lord the ground to work as He pleases, His life will develop and grow in us unto our maturity and perfection (Heb. 10:1, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Behavioral Change Not Being<br />
the Focus of Consecration</h2>
<p>Since consecration does not emphasize our working for God but rather our letting God work in us, consecration is not focused on outward, behavioral change but on the inner growth of God&rsquo;s life. Our behavior has no standing in God&rsquo;s redemption. Our behavior cannot save us, cause us to receive God&rsquo;s life, or cause us to progress in our growth in God&rsquo;s life. Our salvation and our receiving of God&rsquo;s life do not depend on behavior but on believing. In the same way the growth of God&rsquo;s life in us does not depend on behavior but on consecration. Just as believing, the receiving of God&rsquo;s life, is not the issue of behavioral change, consecration is not related to behavioral change.</p>
<p>Consecration is not for us to live a godly life but for us to let God live out from us. Nothing of our working or doing can be brought into God&rsquo;s redemption. God accomplishes everything in His redemption. In His redemption we receive Him and everything that He has done, and then we let Him work in us as He pleases. Our receiving is through believing, and our letting Him work is through consecrating. Although believing in the Lord affects our behavior positively, a change in behavior is not God&rsquo;s goal. Similarly, although consecrating ourselves to the Lord will affect our behavior, this is not God&rsquo;s goal. Consecration is not focused on a change in our behavior but on allowing God to work in us for the growth of His life in us.</p>
<p>The Lord does not want us to work or to do anything for Him; He only wants us to give Him the ground to work Himself into us and to be formed in us. The Lord wants us to consecrate ourselves to Him, to hand all the authority over to Him, so that He may work in us as He pleases. Then His life will grow in us, and He will be formed in us (Gal. 4:19), manifesting His glorious image in us (2 Cor. 3:18). As a result of this inward growth, our outward actions will not be an issue of our behavior but of His life. Everything in our living will be the Lord living out from us; it will not be something of our doing. Although others may regard our living as being an expression of our virtues, we will sense only that the Lord is living out His life in us, based on our consecration to Him.</p>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is not to change our behavior but to work Himself into us so that we may have His life and express His image. From the beginning to the end of His work in us, God&rsquo;s only desire is that His life would develop and grow in us until He is formed in us. Only our consecration, our handing ourselves over to Him, gives Him the opportunity to work this out. Only our consecration gives God the authority in us. Thus, only our consecration gives Him the ground to cause His life to grow in us unto maturity.</p>
<p>This is the focus of consecration. If our consecration does not provide the ground for God&rsquo;s life to grow in us, then our consecration is improper. Proper consecration gives God the ground to do what He wants to do in us so that His life may grow unto maturity. We must examine our consecration in this light and let God gain such a consecration. This is necessary for God&rsquo;s life to grow within us unto maturity, and it is indispensable for us to enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecration Being Continual</h2>
<p>Although consecration is a step, it is not something that can be done only once. Consecration is merely a gate that we pass through and a way that we take. Once we have passed through the gate of consecration, we must walk on the way of consecration. Passing through the gate is for walking on the way; this is the order ordained in the Bible. We must first pass through the gate and then walk on the way (Matt. 7:14). After we are saved, we must have a definite time of consecrating ourselves to the Lord, of passing through the gate of consecration, before we can enter into the blessed realm of enjoying the salvation that we obtained by believing. In order to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation continually after our initial consecration, we must take the way of consecration by not leaving our consecrated position or losing the reality of our consecration. Whenever we leave our consecrated position and stop living a consecrated life, we will lose the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>We need to continually renew our consecration. Actually, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord every morning. Then at every turning point and every juncture in our life, we need a new consecration. Chapters 28 through 29 in the book of Numbers speak of God&rsquo;s people offering a burnt offering every day, every Sabbath, every month, and at every feast. This typifies our continual consecration to God. Through consecration we enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation and let the Lord&rsquo;s life operate and grow in us. We should never cease to consecrate, much less lose our consecration. We must remain in our consecration to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation continually. This is our indispensable responsibility.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">A LIVING OF APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:4-5; 1 John 2:27; Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A BASIC KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to work His life into us so that we may be conformed to the image of the Son, Christ (Rom. 8:29). The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is not to change us from being evil to being good or from being wicked to being virtuous. Rather, it is to make His life available to those who do not have His life and to enable those who receive His life as His sons to bear the image of His Son.</p>
<p>Being good or evil and being virtuous or wicked are concepts that are unrelated to God&rsquo;s redemption; they are religious concepts. God&rsquo;s life is the focus of His redemption, and the image of His Son is the purpose of His redemption. Human religions stress good and evil for the sake of cultivating good human beings. However, God&rsquo;s redemption emphasizes life for the purpose of giving us the life of God and making us sons of God.</p>
<p>Without revelation from God, it is easy to regard the Bible as a book of religious teachings. People think that just as religion instructs people to leave evil and pursue good, the Bible teaches the same thing but with a higher standard. Therefore, they regard the teachings of Christianity and the teachings of other religions to be similar in nature. Those who have received revelation from God, however, know that teachings related to good and evil, even if they are based on the Bible, are the product of man-made religions. The Bible does not teach people to leave evil and pursue good but rather to receive Christ&rsquo;s redemption, to live God&rsquo;s life, and to be conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT CULTIVATING THE SELF<br />
BUT LIVING IN GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Instead of cultivating the good self, God&rsquo;s redeemed should live by His life. When we appropriate redemption, we receive God&rsquo;s life, and God wants us to begin to live by His life. However, it is easy to focus on good deeds and on improving ourselves, because we lack revelation. Consequently, we neglect the life of God in us, and we miss the purpose of His redemption. God&rsquo;s intention is that the image of His Son would be our goal, but we make good deeds our aim. God wants us to live by His life, but we focus on improving ourselves.</p>
<p>We need revelation in order to see that God does not want us to improve ourselves. He wants us to reject the self and live by His life, that is, to live in Him. God does not want good deeds to be our aim; neither does He want us to cultivate ourselves to be good. He wants us to take Christ as our goal and to be conformed to His image. If we see this, we would receive salvation and be transformed.</p>
<p>We should consecrate ourselves to God after we are saved so that His life can work in us. Once we have consecrated ourselves, we need to stop our endeavoring and learn to live by God&rsquo;s life. Consecration is not for us to work for God but to let God work on us. God works on us through His life. In order to be worked on by God, we need to let His life operate in us. This requires that we not only consecrate ourselves to God but also that we stop ourselves and live in His life after our consecration.</p>
<p>Just as the concept of self-cultivation hinders us from living by God&rsquo;s life, the desire to work for God distracts us so that we engage in activities apart from His life. Our activity, our doing, and our working prevent us from living by God&rsquo;s life. Our concepts concerning our self-effort are veils that cover and prevent us from seeing how to live by God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>If we desire to live by God&rsquo;s life, we need to fellowship with Him. God&rsquo;s life is inseparable from God. God&rsquo;s life is God Himself. Hence, if we want to live by His life, we must fellowship with Him. When we fellowship with God, we touch Him, and when we touch Him, we can live by His life.</p>
<p>God wants us to live a life of fellowshipping with Him so that we can live by His life. His life has entered into us in order to grow and mature so that we would bear the image of Christ. If we stop our activities and self-cultivation and, instead, fellowship with Him, His life will have the opportunity to operate, to work, in us, and all that He is will be worked into us. If we live and walk according to the operation of His life in us, we will live by His life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption is focused on the divine life. Therefore, the central significance of the appropriation of redemption is the appropriation of God&rsquo;s life. The degree to which we appropriate God&rsquo;s life will be the degree to which we enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption. To live by God&rsquo;s life is the practical appropriation of redemption and also the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s redemption. In order to live by God&rsquo;s life, we must fellowship with Him and touch the sense of His life.</p>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to make us exactly the same as Christ. This is what God desires to accomplish through His life in us. If we want to allow God to achieve the purpose of His redemption, we must give His life an opportunity to operate in us. Hence, we must stop ourselves and fellowship with God. This is the way to give His life an opportunity to operate freely in us. To fellowship with God and to allow His life to operate in us enable God to achieve the purpose of His redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD<br />
BEING TO ABIDE IN THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord said that He is the vine and that we are the branches (John 15:5). This means that we have one life with Him; that is, His life is lived out through us, and everything of His life is manifested in us. Such a living requires unhindered fellowship with Him. Hence, the Lord wants us to abide in Him. He said, &ldquo;The branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine&rdquo; (v. 4). A branch that does not abide in the vine is severed from the vine, and a branch that cannot bear fruit does not express the life of the vine. Therefore, the Lord said that we cannot bear fruit unless we abide in Him (v. 4).</p>
<p>By abiding in the Lord we can bear much fruit; that is, we can express His life and allow His life to flow out of us. Apart from the Lord we cannot express His life (v. 5). In order to express the Lord&rsquo;s life, we must abide in Him, and to abide in Him is to fellowship with Him. Unhindered fellowship with the Lord opens the way for us to live by His life and express His life in us.</p>
<p>In John 15 the Lord uses the physical life to reveal the mysterious fact of our life union with Him. The Lord is the vine, and we are the branches. As branches, we are joined as one with Him in His life; we take His life as our life and live by His life to express His life. The Lord said that we should abide in Him. He does not require us to bear any other responsibility. In fact, we cannot and need not bear other responsibilities. The branches&rsquo; only responsibility is to abide in the vine. The branches need not do anything but abide in the vine. As long as the branches are not severed from the vine, they can live by the life of the vine and express the life of the vine. This is the relationship that we should have with the Lord after we are saved.</p>
<p>Not only is it natural and spontaneous for branches to abide in the vine and to live by the life of the vine; this is also a blessed and peaceful matter. May the Lord enlighten us to see that we are branches of Christ the vine so that we would abide in Him. We can have a life of living by His life. If we want to live by the Lord&rsquo;s life, to express and flow out His life, we need only to abide in Him and fellowship with Him. We do not need to bear many responsibilities or do many things. Rather, we should stop ourselves and abide in the Lord to fellowship with Him. We need only to abide in Him as branches in the vine; everything else is unnecessary. If we see this, we will stop our activity and abide in the Lord, and He will be lived out of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE LORD REQUIRING US<br />
TO MIND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to abide in the Lord and live by His life, we must mind the Holy Spirit and be according to the Spirit. The Spirit indwells us as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9). This Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ as the reality of the presence of Christ in us. The Spirit dwelling in us is Christ dwelling in us, and the Spirit with us is the Lord with us. Hence, if we want to abide in the Lord, fellowship with Him, and live by His life, we must take care of the operation of the Spirit. In everything that we do, we must mind His will, obey His moving, and closely follow the sense of His life in us. Whether the sense of the Spirit in us is a positive leading or instruction, or it is a negative prohibition or disapproval, we should obey it in every situation. We should not neglect or contradict this sense. In this way we can practically abide in the Lord and live out His life.</p>
<p>The Spirit indwells us as the transfiguration of the Lord and as the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. He is also the anointing in us, moving in us unceasingly. The Spirit teaches us all things through His moving in us so that we can know the Lord&rsquo;s will. The Bible says that we should abide in the Lord according to the teaching of the Spirit as the anointing (1 John 2:27). The teaching of the anointing is the moving of the Spirit within us. The anointing and moving of the Spirit give us a sense so that we may know the Lord&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>If we are willing to mind the anointing and moving of the Spirit within us and to obey the sense that He gives us, we will live in Him and abide in Him. This is to live by the Lord&rsquo;s life. To mind the anointing and moving of the Spirit requires us to stop our thoughts and our activities. It does not matter whether we are occupied with things that are good or bad, right or wrong; we must be willing to stop ourselves in order to mind the anointing and moving of the Spirit to abide in the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BASIC PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Our basic problem is our own doing and our own working. After we are saved, we all feel that we should earnestly work and do things in order to please and glorify God. Although we think that this is right and proper, it is only a human concept; this is not God&rsquo;s view. In His redemption God wants the Spirit, as the transfiguration of Christ, to enter into us to be our life. He wants us to live by the life of Christ, living out this life from within us. If we focus on doing things and working for God, we will neglect the anointing of the Spirit within us and be unable to live by the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Our activities, thoughts, and decisions cause us to live in ourselves rather than in the Spirit. They cause us to live by our abilities rather than by Christ&rsquo;s life. These things may seem to be pleasing from the human point of view and seem to glorify God, but they are not the issue of living by the Lord&rsquo;s life. Such things are not related to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose for redemption. At best, our doing and working will produce good deeds, but they will not express the Lord&rsquo;s life. Such activities are not the issue of living by the Lord&rsquo;s life through the Spirit. We must stop our doing and our working; we must drop our thoughts, determinations, and efforts. Instead, we should focus on the Spirit&rsquo;s moving in us. If we are willing to pay the price to follow the moving of the Spirit within us, there will be no barriers to our abiding in the Lord and living by His life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE SAME IMAGE<br />
AS THE LORD FROM GLORY TO GLORY</h2>
<p>When we abide in the Lord and fellowship with Him through the Holy Spirit, we enable Him to gain ground in us. We also cause the Lord&rsquo;s life to grow and gradually mature in us until our whole being is occupied by and filled with Him. Then the Lord&rsquo;s life will be lived out through us, and we will be transformed into the same image as the Lord (2 Cor. 3:17-18). This means that our spirit will be filled with the Lord, and our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;will be filled with the Lord. Then our thoughts, desires, and decisions will be the Lord&rsquo;s thoughts, desires, and decisions. We will be joined fully with the Lord as one. Thus, whatever we do will be pleasing to God, and our work will be to His glory, because our doing and our working will be out of the Lord. This is a living that appropriates God&rsquo;s redemption.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ISSUE OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:16; 4:19; 2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Cor. 15:51-55; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to gain a group of people to be the many brothers of His Son, the Firstborn, so that they may have the life and the image of His Son to express the glory of His Son in all things (Rom. 8:29-30). This is the goal and the ultimate purpose in both God&rsquo;s creation and His redemption. Although God&rsquo;s redemption deals with sin, sins, the old creation, and Satan, dealing with these things is not the purpose of His redemption. Rather, these necessary measures are part of the procedure for God to fulfill His purpose. For example, even though dealing with Satan is related to God&rsquo;s purpose, it fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose as it relates to negative matters; however, it is not the positive goal of God&rsquo;s redemption. God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose in its positive sense is to work His life into us to conform us to the image of His Son, that is, to make us exactly the same as His Son in life and nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE ISSUE OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is to be transformed into the image of the Son, Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). When we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, we receive forgiveness of sins, peace, and other blessings. However, these are secondary blessings; they are not the ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption. The ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to conform us to the image of His Son; hence, the ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is that we are transformed into the image of Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption takes the life of God as the center, and it takes the image of Christ as the goal. The central significance of God&rsquo;s redemption is to appropriate the life of God, and the ultimate issue of our appropriation is to bear the image of the Son. Furthermore, when our living appropriates God&rsquo;s redemption, the life of God is the source of our living. Such a living issues in our being transformed into the image of Christ. The ultimate issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is that we are transformed fully into the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>When we believe and receive the Lord as our Savior, we begin to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, and God begins to reveal His Son in us. When we believe, God forgives our sins, justifies us, and bestows other blessings on us, but the central work of God in His salvation is to reveal His Son in us (Gal. 1:16). All the items in God&rsquo;s salvation, whether it is the forgiveness of sins, justification, regeneration, or renewing, are for the purpose of revealing His Son in us. God reveals His Son in us in order for us to be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In the process of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption, God works in us so that Christ would grow in us gradually. As we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption and live in the life of God, the Spirit of life will eliminate the things in us that are contrary to God&rsquo;s image, thus, giving more ground for the Son to grow in us. Then the Spirit can cause Christ to grow in us. If we are willing to remain in the position of consecration, allowing God to work in us continually through His Spirit and with His life, He will work in us so that His revealed Son is formed in us (4:19). Thus, we will bear the image of Christ.</p>
<p>After we begin to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption by faith and receive the Lord, the central purpose of all the work of God in us is for Christ to grow and be formed in us. This process requires our cooperation to allow Him to work in us freely. If we want to continue to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption beyond our initial salvation, we must hand over ourselves to God through consecration, allowing Him to work in us and on us as He pleases. With our consecration, He will remove little by little the things in us that do not match Christ, and He will work everything of Christ into our being until He is formed in us, and we bear His image in a full way.</p>
<p>In this process God will expose the things in us that do not match Christ and that hinder the growth of Christ in us. If we are faithful and remain in the position of consecration, allowing Him to work, He will remove these things one by one so that Christ will gain more ground to grow and be formed in us.</p>
<p>In our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s focus is on how much we allow Christ to grow and be formed in us. If we see this, we will not mistake improvement in our behavior, better control of our temper, or our good works as being spiritual progress. Spiritual progress is nothing else than the growth of Christ in us, the increase of His element in us. Nothing else should be considered to be spiritual progress. Only the growth of Christ in us, the increase of His element in us, is genuine spiritual progress. Therefore, we must allow God to work in us so that Christ can grow in us.</p><h2 class="head1">WORKING FROM OUR SPIRIT INTO OUR SOUL</h2>
<p>When we first begin to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, God reveals His Son through the Spirit in our spirit to be our life (Gal.1:16; John 3:6). From that point until now, God&rsquo;s work through the Spirit is focused on working the life of His Son in our spirit into our entire being.</p>
<p>When we were redeemed by God initially, we received Christ in our spirit as life, but Christ as life was not in our soul. Our spirit was constituted with the life and nature of the Son because we were joined to the Lord as one spirit. However, the element of the Son was not present in the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will. As a result, our mind, emotion, and will could not express the image of the Son. When we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, receive the Spirit&mdash;the transfiguration of Christ&mdash;in our spirit, and consecrate to allow God to continue His work in us, the element of Christ will spread from our spirit into the parts of our soul. In our position of consecration, God will continually work the element of Christ from our spirit into the parts of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;so that the image of Christ can be expressed through the parts of our soul.</p>
<p>After being saved, a brother may be very zealous, but there may be no flavor of the Lord in his mind; that is, his reasonings and thoughts are full of his own element. Thus, without the element of the Lord in his mind, there is no expression of the image of the Lord through his reasonings and thoughts. Likewise, after being saved, a sister&rsquo;s conduct can be very good, but there may be no flavor of the Lord in her emotion; that is, her desires reflect only her element. Thus, without any element of the Lord in her desires, there is no expression of the image of the Lord through her desires. Still others may have much spiritual pursuit after being saved, but there is no place for the Lord in their will; that is, all their decisions come from themselves instead of from the Lord. Consequently, there is no sense or flavor of the Lord with them. It is possible to receive Christ as the Spirit in our spirit but not allow God to work the element of Christ from our spirit into the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will. Although we have Christ in our spirit, we may not have His element in the parts of our soul. In order to bear the image of Christ so that people sense the flavor of God in our mind, emotion, and will, we must offer ourselves unconditionally to God so that He can work the element of Christ from our spirit into all the parts of our soul through His Spirit. When we are willing to allow God to work in us in such a way, we will not only have the life and nature of Christ in our spirit but also the element and flavor of Christ in our soul. Then we will bear the image of Christ, and people will sense the flavor of Christ in our thoughts, preferences, and decisions.</p>
<p>Our mind, emotion, and will are full of our own element. We live by our mind, emotion, and will, and we express our mind, emotion, and will. These parts are full of our element and express only us. However, God wants our whole being to be filled with His Son to express His Son. His first step is to reveal His Son in our spirit. His second step is to work from our spirit into our soul so that the parts of our soul, which we now live according to, may be filled with the element of His Son and express the image of His Son. Consequently, God must deal with our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>Hence, after we are saved, God renews our mind (Rom. 12:2), delivering our reasonings and thoughts from earthly things in order to mind the things of Christ. He also brings the arrogant and self-exalting thoughts in our mind unto the obedience of Christ (2 Cor. 10:5), renewing our mind from our old thoughts in order to have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16). God not only purifies our mind but also fills our mind with the element of His Son. Through His renewing, all the activities of our mind, whether thoughts, considerations, or realizations, will express the image of His Son.</p>
<p>After we are saved, God also touches our emotion so that our desire would be inclined toward Christ. Thus, God delivers our emotion out of the realm of earthly things to focus on His Son, and He also deals with our emotion so that its love will match Christ&rsquo;s love. In this way He causes our emotion to be filled with the element of Christ so that our inclinations, preferences, delight, anger, sorrow, and joy will express the image of Christ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after we are saved, God also deals with our will, causing our will to not only choose and obey Christ but even to make the choices and decisions of Christ our choices and decisions. In this way, God not only breaks, subdues, and purifies our will but also fills our will with the element of Christ. Thus, the actions of our will in our decisions, choices, and judgments will be those of Christ, expressing the image of Christ.</p>
<p>We have Christ as our life in our spirit. Now the primary work of God in us is to work the life of Christ in our spirit into the parts of our soul and eventually to spread to our body.</p><h2 class="head1">LIFE SPREADING FROM OUR SOUL INTO OUR BODY</h2>
<p>If we are willing to allow the life and element of Christ to spread from our spirit into our soul, the life of Christ will spread further into our body. Romans 8:10 speaks of Christ being in us and of our spirit being life because of righteousness. Then verse 11 says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This makes our mortal and weak body living and strong.</p>
<p>Our body is mortal and weak because of the damage of sin. It is especially weak and powerless in the matters of living for the Lord and of doing the Lord&rsquo;s will. From experience we know that our body is unable to meet our needs in relation to spiritual matters (Matt. 26:41). Sometimes our body is weak and powerless, and sometimes the functions of our body are dull and unresponsive. This is because our body has been damaged by sin and is under the weakness that comes through the operation of death. Sin brings in death, and death causes weakness. When sin entered our body, it brought the element of death into our body, making our body and its members full of weakness. This is our condition.</p>
<p>Now, however, we are joined to the Lord in our spirit through the Spirit, making our spirit alive and even life itself (Eph. 2:5; Rom. 8:10). If we allow the Spirit to work in us continually, the life of Christ in our spirit will spread into every part of our being. The Spirit who indwells us will surely cause the life of Christ, which is the resurrection power of Christ, to spread into our body of death and weakness, making our mortal and weak body living and strong (v. 11). Thus, our body will be able to meet our needs in relation to spiritual matters, and it will be filled with the life of Christ, expressing the resurrection power of Christ and giving people a sense of Christ in us.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for some brothers and sisters to be unable to hear spiritual things with their ears, to understand and remember spiritual things with their mind, or to have the physical strength to meet a spiritual need. However, when these brothers and sisters consecrate themselves to the Lord and allow the Spirit to work in them, the Lord&rsquo;s life in their spirit will operate and spread into every part of their being. Their ears and mind will be keen to hear and understand spiritual things, and their physical strength will be adequate to meet the practical needs associated with carrying out spiritual matters. The Spirit causes the Lord&rsquo;s life to spread from our spirit into our body so that our weak and powerless body can be strong and powerful. Thus, the divine life will not only fill our spirit but also our soul and body. Then our whole being will begin to express the image of Christ to the extent that this life spreads in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>As we continually appropriate the redemption of God and allow God to work in us, Christ will spread outward from our spirit and be expressed in us, and we will be transformed and conformed to His image (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29). When we allow God to work in us through the Spirit, we will be transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRANSFIGURED</h2>
<p>When we are transformed to this extent, our spirit will be joined as one with the Lord, our soul will bear His image, and our body will glorify Him. In such a condition of maturity, we will be ready to be transfigured. The ultimate manifestation of our appropriation of the redemption of God will be the transfiguration of the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory.</p>
<p>Through the work of the Spirit, our spirit and every part of our soul will be transformed into the image of Christ, and our body will be made living, strong, keen, and powerful through its transfiguration. We have not yet put off the old creation completely, because our body and its humiliation are still part of the old creation. Nevertheless, the Lord will carry out this final step when the body of our humiliation is transfigured to be &ldquo;conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21). At that time we will be exactly the same as Christ from center to circumference; that is, our spirit, soul, and body will be full of His element. We will have His life and nature inwardly, and we will express His image outwardly, fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PLAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to gain many people, who have the life of the Firstborn and bear His image, to be the many brothers of the Firstborn. From God&rsquo;s revealing of His Son in our spirit through faith to the transfiguration of our body in glory, all God&rsquo;s work in us is directed toward the goal of conforming us to the image of His Son.</p>
<p>When the Lord transfigures our body to be like His body of glory, His goal will be accomplished, and His eternal plan will be fulfilled. At that time Christ will lead many sons into glory, and we will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:21). As those who have the life and the image of Christ and who have entered into the glory and freedom of Christ, we will be like Him and be manifested together with Him in glory as His glorious partners in whom He is fully expressed.</p>
<p>At that time, just as Christ has the divine life and nature as well as the human life and nature in glory, we also will have the divine life and nature as well as the human life and nature in glory. Just as Christ expresses the glory of His divinity in His humanity, we also will express the glory of His divinity in our humanity. Just as God is expressed in the Son, the Son will also be expressed in us.</p>
<p>The expression of the Son in us is simply the expression of God in His Son in us. At that time we will express Christ in glory. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption and the issue of our appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption. May we all see this and take this as the goal of our pursuit.</p></body></html>
