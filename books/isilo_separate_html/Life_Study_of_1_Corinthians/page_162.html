Verse 28 says, &ldquo;But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.&rdquo; To prove ourselves is to check whether we are eating the bread and drinking the cup in a way that is worthy or in a way that is unworthy. When Paul wrote this Epistle, some of the believers at Corinth ate the Lord&rsquo;s supper in an unworthy way, not realizing that the cup and the bread were uncommon and different from ordinary food. We must realize that the cup signifies the blood the Lord shed on the cross for our sins. Thus, we should not drink it in a common, ordinary way, but drink it in a way which shows that we realize that it is different from ordinary drink. We should take the bread in the same manner.</p><p>However, we reject the superstitious Catholic teaching of transubstantiation. According to this heretical teaching, the bread and the wine in the cup actually become the body and blood of Christ.</p><p>Although we reject transubstantiation, we must realize as we drink the cup and eat the bread that these are solemn, holy, and divine signs. The cup signifies the precious blood our dear Lord shed on the cross for our sins, and the bread signifies the body He gave for us on the cross. Therefore, we should not treat these signs in a careless manner. If we eat and drink carelessly, then we partake of the Lord&rsquo;s supper in an unworthy way. We need to prove ourselves to be sure that we are not unworthy to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s supper. This proving ourselves is that we may be worthy to remember the Lord.</p><p>The second crucial word used by Paul is discern. Verse 29 says, &ldquo;For he who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body.&rdquo; We have pointed out that this is the discerning both of the Lord&rsquo;s physical body and also of the mystical Body for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. Proving ourselves is for the remembrance of the Lord; discerning the Body is mainly for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we should not just enjoy the Lord; we should also remember Him by proving ourselves. We must ask if we are living in a way that is worthy for us to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper. We should never take the Lord&rsquo;s blood and body in a careless manner. Instead, we should realize that the signs on the table signify the precious blood and body of the Lord. Then we must ask ourselves if we live and behave in a way that is worthy of our eating this supper. This is to remember the Lord. At the same time we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the unique mystical Body of Christ or if it signifies a division. If the bread signifies a certain divisive group or denomination, we should not take it, for we discern the Body. To discern the Body in this way is to recognize that it is utterly distinct from anything divisive. We discern the Body in such a way for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration.</p><p>Although we are still small in number, the angels and demons know that our standing is different from that of divisive Christianity. Furthermore, deep within we have the assurance that we are discerning the Body for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration on earth. We are also the heavenly television reflecting on earth what Christ is doing in the heavens for the divine administration. Others may oppose us, argue with us, and vindicate themselves. But deep within their conscience they do not have the assurance that they are discerning the unique mystical Body. Praise the Lord, we have this assurance!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_161.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_163.html">Next</a> </body></html>
