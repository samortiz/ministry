   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IMPROVING THE WAY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The most crucial matter in a scientific approach is to conduct thorough research.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should do research from a number of perspectives to obtain statistics.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the statistics we can determine an appropriate and scientific method.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With regard to the way we preach the gospel, everything needs to be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The ideal way for us to improve our preaching of the gospel is to use videotapes and even television.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It would be wonderful if every household on the island of Taiwan could watch the church preaching the gospel and hear people say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the activities of the church need to be recorded on videotape and made available on television.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if people do not want to receive the gospel, when they turn on their television, they would hear us sing, Since Jesus came into my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they switch to another station, they would again hear us sing, Vanity, vanity...all things are vain, Christ only is gain!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they switch to a third station, they would hear, You need Jesus, you need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They would be pressed by the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these scenarios are not only a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that we will see the day when every household that turns on the television will hear programs concerning the gospel, Jesus, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sound of Hallelujah and Amen should fill the air.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether such a scenario will materialize and whether we can carry it out depend on our research.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today Chinese operas and folk operas are available on television.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely we do not want to imitate others, but we need to research how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not use the old method of pulling an ox cart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The co-workers need to rise up to consider how the work should improve.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should consider and evaluate whether we should videotape the activities of the church and put them on television.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We hope that one day the messages given in the morning will be aired the evening of the same day and viewed by every household on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also hope that the faces of the brothers and sisters in the meetings can be seen on television.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not Sticking to the Old Ways but Improving</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our inherent problem is that the serving ones have not progressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even commercial packaging has made improvements, but we are still using methods from thirty-five years ago for the sake of saving money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should progress and change our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may want to save money, but in fact, we are losing money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In recent years businesses have invested a large amount of money in packaging.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, in Japan they package merchandise with layers of paper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The outer layers are fancier, and the last layer has a pretty bow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows what Japanese businesses are willing to do to entice customers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This illustration is used mainly to give us a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not a reprimand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to see that we have suffered a loss because we would rather stay with the old ways than advance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The attitude of the government in Taiwan has always been reform, which has brought in much success.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Chinese people are intelligent and capable and can succeed as long as they drop the attitude of sticking to the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These examples may seem to deviate from our burden, but the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not stick to the old ways, but rather, we should seek to improve our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has richly blessed us in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The environment is good, the church is blessed, and there is a large number of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is regrettable that we hold on to our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To further illustrate, the frame of my front door is made of wood, and a section of it needed to be repaired.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many American brothers know how to fix things, and they often told me that if anything in my house needs repair, I should let them know.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So I told them about the doorframe.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to my Chinese way of thinking, the only need was to repair the damaged section of the doorframe, but the American way was to replace the entire doorframe with a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was inexpensive and did not take long to do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, it would have taken much longer and been more expensive to repair only the damaged section of the doorframe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The American brothers did this according to the American logic, the American economics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Chinese logic, the Chinese economics, is to save money by repairing only the damaged portion of the doorframe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I did not know that it is not easy to repair a doorframe, because wood must be found that matches the color of the original doorframe, which is a troublesome task.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This example shows us two kinds of logic, two ways of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One belongs to the new era, and the other belongs to the old.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church needs to keep up with the new era.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The bound volumes of the Life-studies of Paul s fourteen Epistles are a proof of a change in our style.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The printing, design, and binding of the Life-studies are of top quality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before we went to print, we gathered samples of all the hardbound books on the market that were nicely done.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The size of the Life-studies is larger than most books on the market.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every volume can be opened flat, which is not a small thing in a hardbound book.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We spent much effort to research and print a good quality book.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the past it was difficult to locate a bookbinder in Taiwan who could meet our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is different now.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many bookbinders have improved their skills.</S>
