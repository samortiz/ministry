<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Fight Together with God and for God</H2><P>As a priestly army, God's chosen and redeemed people fought together with God and for God. If we would fight together with God and for God today, we must first move, walk, and live with Him and also pass through many things in the wilderness. Only in this way can we be qualified to fight together with God.</P><P>The children of Israel fought not only with God but also for God. In the church life today, we should also fight for God. This indicates that our church life is actually for God and not mainly for us. However, our feeling concerning the church life may be too subjective and selfish. In the meeting someone may testify, saying, "Before I came into the church life, I was homeless. Now in the church I am at home. Oh, how good is the church life!" Yes, we are at home in the church life. Nevertheless, we need to realize that the church life is not mainly for us but for God. We should be able to say, "Lord, the church life is actually Your life. You want to live this way, and we are living together with You. If we did not live and move with You, You would not have Your satisfaction. You do not want to be alone. You have chosen, redeemed, and saved us to accompany You in Your move. Our church life, Lord, is really for You."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Defeat the King of Arad and Destroy His People</H2><P>In their fighting together with God and for God, the children of Israel defeated the king of Arad and destroyed his people (Num. 21:1-3). By doing this, they overcame the first enemy among the Canaanites.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Defeat Sihon King of the Amorites<br>with His People and Og King of<br>Bashan with His People</H2><P>God's people also defeated Sihon king of the Amorites with his people and Og king of Bashan with his people (21:21-35). This means that they overcame Canaan's two gate guards.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Defeat the Midianites with Their Five Kings</H2><P>The children of Israel also defeated the Midianites with their five kings (31:1-12). By defeating the Midianites the people overcame Canaan's gate army.</P><P>The kings defeated by God's chosen and redeemed people signify the spiritual powers, rulers, and authorities in the air. Today we need to fight against these powers and defeat them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. For the Entranceinto the God-promised<br>Good Land That the Kingdom of God Might Be<br>Spread and Established There</H2><P>The fighting of God's people against the kings was for the entrance into the God-promised good land that the kingdom of God might be spread and established there. The principle is the same with us today. When we defeat the rulers, powers, and authorities in the air, the kingdom of God surely is spread and established.</P>
