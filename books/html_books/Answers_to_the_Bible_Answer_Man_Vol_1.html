They were answers to an attack made by Walter Martin, who called himself &#8220;the Bible Answer Man.&#8221; Martin made this attack against Witness Lee and &#8220;the Local Church&#8221; in a lecture given at Melodyland Christian Center in Anaheim, California on October 2, 1977. The tape of that lecture, entitled Witness Lee and the Local Church, is still in circulation today. This book again publishes the answers to that tape.<p>These responses were first published in a public forum because of the wide influence of Melodyland in Southern California and Martin&#8217;s national radio audience. These original articles sparked a media conflict as Martin increased his attack through his radio program. The churches continued to answer Martin and challenged the truth of his statements through purchased space in the newspaper. Beginning with these responses and continuing for twenty-two weeks, the churches answered with twenty-one separate responses. The present book is only the two initial responses which directly answered the charges made in the Melodyland meeting. The Bible Answer Man was answered, challenged, exposed, and publicly embarrassed. In spite of all the articles, he refused to acknowledge the truth-that his organization, Christian Research Institute (CRI), had misrepresented and falsely accused Witness Lee and the churches that follow his ministry.<p>The media exchange of 1977, however, was not the beginning of the conflict between CRI and the local churches. Three years earlier, CRI-related people had begun to harass the local churches. They published two tracts in 1975 and 1976, leafleted a local church meeting, held public seminars against our teaching, attacked on the radio, and personally counseled people to leave the churches. All of this was done before they ever made an official approach to the leaders of the local churches to confirm their conclusions or to give those leaders a chance to explain their views. In short, they acted as attacking opposers, not scholarly researchers.<p>Before the events of 1977, those in the local churches had already made several attempts to correct the errors of the CRI authors. This was done both in person and in writing. In each case the response was confrontational arrogance that eliminated any true fellowship or even proper discussion. Thus, a pattern developed of attacking while ignoring the protests from the churches that what CRI circulated did not reflect what the churches really believed.<p>In early 1977 Walter Martin was publicly confronted by representatives of the local churches. They again insisted that the CRI statements did not reflect the churches&#8217; beliefs and offered to discuss the problems with him. Martin issued an apology to Witness Lee and suspended all CRI writings concerning Witness Lee and &#8220;the Local Church&#8221; until such discussion could take place. Based upon that apology and the suspending of the tracts, Witness Lee met with Walter Martin in February 1977.<p>The two agreed to stop all publications until Martin could come to an adequate understanding of the true beliefs of the local churches, through mutual fellowship. Martin was offered complete cooperation for his research. That agreement was broken about a week later when one of Martin&#8217;s research associates resumed the attack upon the churches through letters from CRI. Witness Lee insisted that the agreement could be continued only if Martin dealt with the infractions. Martin answered in the old CRI mode-by renewing the attack. Of course, Martin ignored the fact that the research which he agreed should be done had, in fact, never been done.<p>Martin&#8217;s response to the canceled agreement was the source of the meeting at Melodyland and the tape that is still sold today by CRI. Martin admitted on the tape that he relied mainly upon his youthful assistants. He repeated their old accusations, which by then had already been refuted. He endorsed a book, The Mindbenders, that proved to be so blatantly biased and false that it was later retracted with apology by its publisher. Martin&#8217;s tape displayed a lack of understanding of the Bible, theology, and church history. At the same time, it was steeped in the sarcastic arrogance that was Martin&#8217;s trademark.<p>All of these shortcomings are developed in the following articles. The result should have been predictable. I never heard the Bible Answer Man admit error. On one program, after discovering he had condemned one of Billy Graham&#8217;s writings, he calmly said he would straighten him out the next time he saw him! After all, he was the Bible Answer Man. Thus the challenge and embarrassment of the media conflict only hardened Martin&#8217;s line of attack. He ignored the detailed responses of the local churches in the newspaper. (The titles of the twenty-one responses are listed in the appendix.) Instead of answering the challenges of the local churches, Martin simply repeated the falsehood that we would not deal with the issues!<p>In January 1978, CRI published The Teachings of Witness Lee and the Local Church. Although the charges in this new booklet had already been addressed and answered, it was published as if the churches had never made a response. The final four articles in the series of newspaper responses, listed in the appendix, were direct answers to their new publication. True to form, CRI also ignored these responses. In 1980 Martin published The New Cults. The people at CRI have been repeatedly advised that what they are circulating concerning Witness Lee and &#8220;the Local Church&#8221; is not true. They have ignored this from 1975 until today.<p>The new Bible Answer Man continues the CRI tradition. In April of 1993 he rejected an appeal from representatives from the local churches to publicly examine the truth or falsehood of CRI&#8217;s critical publications. Almost simultaneously with that rejection, he sent a new attacking letter to an inquirer about the church. In 1994 he continues to attack on the radio, repeating the same old errors that have been challenged and corrected.<p>This book is not for CRI. This book is for the innocent people who have been affected by CRI&#8217;s stubborn opposition. It is not for those who believe that anything published in the name of Christian research must be true. It is not for those who appreciate sarcasm above scholarship or for those who are comfortable in the traditions of man. Rather, it is for those who love God&#8217;s Word above all and have the hunger and nobility of the Bereans, who &#8220;received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so&#8221; (Acts 17:11).<p>In order to preserve their historical value, no changes have been made in the content of the articles from 1977. The articles have been rearranged by subject in order to facilitate study. The categories, listed in the table of contents, reflect the main areas of misrepresentation in CRI&#8217;s attacks. Since the charge was made that those in the local churches were theologically uneducated and confused Christians, the educational credentials of the authors were given in the original articles. These have not been retained in this printing. Suffice it to say that of the thirteen authors of these articles, eleven have a bachelor&#8217;s degree, four have a master&#8217;s degree, and ten have seminary training. The authors&#8217; names have been deleted.<p>May the Lord reward all who read this book with the truth concerning Himself and His purpose on earth.<p><p>Dan Towle<p>Anaheim, California<p>March 1994<h1 class=msg>SUMMARY COMMENTS FROM 1977</h1><p>The Introduction and Conclusion below were published in The Orange County Register in 1977 along with the following eighteen articles by members representing the local churches.<h2 class=head1>1. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>The teaching and person of Witness Lee and the practice of the local churches were attacked and misrepresented at a meeting held Sunday night, October 2, 1977, at Melodyland, Anaheim, California. We in the local churches feel constrained to respond to the groundless and unwarranted accusations made by the speaker. We have no desire or intention to fight against any person or group. The following articles, written by several brothers representing all the local churches in the U.S.A. and Witness Lee, are presented so that the Christian public may judge for itself what is the truth.<h2 class=head1>2. CONCLUSION</h2><p>Through the centuries genuine Christians have held many different views of doctrinal matters, especially concerning the Trinity and the church. Even though we may differ with one another and even debate concerning the truth, we must maintain a proper attitude of love and respect toward one another. To attack other believers or mock those who differ from us in our understanding of Scripture certainly does not represent the spirit of Christian love. <p>Matthew 7:20 says, &#8220;Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; A tree can surely be known by the fruit it bears. The life and ministry of Witness Lee have resulted in the salvation of thousands personally brought to the Lord by him, and the raising up of over 230 churches established directly by his ministry in the past forty years. In addition, another twenty churches are directly under the nourishment of his ministry. Scores of books on practical Christian living, essential truths of the Scripture, and the truths concerning the church and church practice have been published and are readily available. Also, over 300 Life-study Messages by Witness Lee on the books Genesis, Matthew, John, Romans, Hebrews, and Revelation, containing the richest exposition, have been released.<p>Where today can one find a life and ministry so fruitful as this?</p><h1 class=msg>WITNESS LEE RESPONDS</h1><h2 class=head1>3. A STATEMENT BY WITNESS LEE</h2><p>It is very sad and shameful that Christian brothers have been continually fighting one against another through the centuries. It is mainly because their understanding of the Bible differs; they have different views and are on different levels. The reasons for this are three.<p>1.The Bible, being the revelation of God, is extremely profound. On its surface are the plain doctrines, but in its depth are the deep and vital truths. It is easy to know the doctrines of the Bible, but more grace is required to realize the deeper truths revealed in the Bible concerning God&#8217;s eternal purpose. For example, John 1:29 tells us that the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the Lamb of God to bear our sins that we may be redeemed. All real Christians know this.  But the same Gospel, chapter twelve, verse 24, reveals that the Lord died also as a grain of wheat, falling into the ground to release His life, that He might be multiplied into many grains for the formation of His Body, which is the church. It seems that the speaker at Melodyland has not seen this truth, because he has accused us of being heretical concerning this matter. Actually, it is not that we are heretical, but that he has not seen this deep thing of God (1 Cor. 2:10). <p>Another example: First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house of the living God and the pillar and ground of the truth. But the very next verse, verse 16, reveals that the church is also the mystery of godliness, that is, God was manifest in the flesh. The church is not only the house of God, the pillar and ground of the truth, but also the manifestation of God in the flesh. The context of this verse confirms this. This is also a deep truth, for which we are condemned by the speaker. Again, it seems that he is short of sight in this matter.<p>2.The truths in the Bible are often of two aspects, the objective and the subjective. The subjective aspect is mainly for our experience. For example, on one hand Christ today is in the heavens, but on the other hand Christ today is also in us, and His being in us is that we may experience Him as life and the life supply. Since He is the very embodiment of God, and since we have Him within us as our life, we partake of the divine nature of God. This subjective truth was also objected to by the speaker, because he simply did not see it.<p>Another example: The Holy Trinity not only has the side of three, but also the side of one. On one hand our Triune God is three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but on the other hand He is one, the unique God. This is clearly and fully revealed in the Holy Word. But sorry to say, the speaker, standing unbalanced on the side of three, fights against the side of one. Although he says that God is one, the oneness in his concept is a corporate oneness, not the individual oneness of our unique God, because he does not believe the pure word in Isaiah 9:6 and 1 Corinthians 15:45.<p>3.The divine revelation was fully completed when the book of Revelation was written to the churches. But not long after that, the church began to lose sight of God&#8217;s open revelation and deviate from the central line of His perfect Word. Thus, the Bible became a veiled book until the time of reformation, when Martin Luther was raised up by the Lord to begin the recovery of the lost truths. Luther, by returning to the Bible from the deviated historic church, discovered the truth of justification by faith among the lost truths. However, that was just the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Thence, through the past five centuries, the Lord has continually carried on His recovery through many different channels. How we thank the Lord for those channels! But there has always been a sad story accompanying each step of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Nearly every time a lost truth was recovered by some new channels, the old channels fought against the newly discovered truth, and even fought against the channels used by the Lord to recover that truth. In principle, it is the same today.<p>I was born, raised up, and educated in Christianity. From my youth I have been taught with Bible stories and many teachings of the Bible. After I was saved, I sat at the feet of the great Brethren teachers, listening to hundreds of their messages concerning the Bible. Later I was helped by reading the inner-life books, such as the books by Madame Guyon, Andrew Murray, and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. After that, I was also involved in the Pentecostal movement. Then the Lord showed us from His Word a number of lost truths, such as the multiplication, the enlargement, of the unlimited Christ, the corporate Christ, the church being the manifestation of God in the flesh, the proper unity of the Body of Christ, the practical expression of the church, and other items.<p>Because these truths are new to some dear Christian brothers, they consider them as heresies, as teachings which are not according to the Bible. Then they fight against these newly recovered truths under the excuse of contending for the faith once delivered to the saints. Sometimes these Christian brothers have gone so far that they have even fought their battle by building up false accusations according to their erroneous or inadequate understanding of the Bible. Actually, these newly recovered truths are absolutely scriptural. To see these truths requires that the veil of traditional concepts held by the so-called historic church be taken away, and that the Lord&#8217;s people come back to the pure Word of God in His Holy Writings. We, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, following the footsteps of Martin Luther, only care for the pure Word, not for any traditional concept of the historic church. These three reasons are just brief principles.<p>Lastly, I would like to say a word from my heart. We Christian brothers may hold different opinions concerning certain truths and may argue over them one with another. But let us do it in a spirit and on a level that are worthy of a saint in Christ. The truths of the Bible are holy. We do not believe that any mocking, ridiculing, or despising is the way for a saint to contend for the holy truths of our Holy God. It is a solemn thing to deal with the Word of God. We may edify others; we may also destroy others. We must always remind ourselves that whatever we say and do will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ when He comes back. May the Lord&#8217;s grace be with us all!<h1 class=msg>GOD IN TRINITY</h1><h2 class=head1>4. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE TRINITY</h2><p>The public statements made at Melodyland on October 2, 1977 regarding what Witness Lee and the local churches believe concerning the Trinity contain at least fifteen errors. Some of these errors are now openly stated and refuted by the local churches:<p>1.The error of public misrepresentation. The speaker charged that &#8220;Witness Lee and the local church are anti the historic view of Trinitarian theology...and have adopted an ancient church heresy known as Monarchianistic Modalism.&#8221; This is false and grossly misrepresents our own testimony. We have published several booklets available to the public for almost two years fully exposing and denying as heresy every form of Monarchianistic Modalism. These booklets also contain our belief and experience of the Triune God according to the Bible with positive affirmations concerning the historic statements contained in the Nicene-Constantinople Creed regarding the Trinity. Yet, the speaker refuses to acknowledge our confession and has publicly misrepresented Witness Lee and the local churches.<p>2.The error with historical data. The speaker presents to the public that there are two types of Modalism or two classic modes of modalistic theology which he says are heretical theology. These two types or two classic modes he identifies as &#8220;logical&#8221; and &#8220;illogical.&#8221; The illogical he says &#8220;recognize[s] that the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit somehow exist at the same time and yet are each other.&#8221; This is a false presentation of historical data in order to identify Witness Lee with heresy. The fact is that no form of modalism believed that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit existed at the same time; otherwise, they would not have been classified as Monarchianistic Modalism.<p>3.The error of the wrong interpretation of Witness Lee&#8217;s writings. The speaker and his associates claim that it took them hundreds of pages of wading and documentation to come up with the fact that the Holy Spirit is in the process of becoming the church so that the church ends up as God. What was conveyed to the public was that Witness Lee believes in a pantheistic evolution into God. This is a subtle accusation under the guise of having read Witness Lee&#8217;s writings. The speaker and his associates have not interpreted Witness Lee in the way these truths were intended. The Christian public has been deceived by the speaker&#8217;s false presentation of Witness Lee&#8217;s belief in the Triune God and His relationship to the church.<p>4.The error of changing the Scripture. The speaker advised Witness Lee to take some lessons in Hebrew concerning Isaiah 9:6. The speaker stated that the word for Father means &#8220;author, source, and origin&#8221; of the everlasting according to the Jews, evading the clear title Father. This is a bold thing for the speaker to do in changing the meaning of the Hebrew word used in Isaiah 9:6 for &#8220;Father.&#8221; This same Hebrew word is used over one thousand times in the Old Testament, and every time it is translated &#8220;father.&#8221; This Father in Isaiah 9:6 can only be the Father in the Godhead or else you hold two Divine Fathers. To have two Divine Fathers is heresy. The speaker should reflect on what is stated in The Pulpit Commentary by Dr. George Rawlinson on Isaiah 9:6:<p>The Everlasting Father; rather, Everlasting or Eternal Father. But here, again, there is a singularity in the idea, which makes the omission of the article unimportant; for how could there be more than one Everlasting Father, one Creator, Preserver, Protector of mankind who was absolutely eternal? If the term &#8220;Father,&#8221; applied to our Lord grates our ears, we must remember that the distinctions of Persons in the Godhead has not yet been revealed.<p>Regardless of how the speaker may interpret &#8220;The everlasting Father,&#8221; whether as &#8220;the Father of eternity,&#8221; &#8220;the Father of creation,&#8221; &#8220;the Father of the age to come,&#8221; &#8220;the Father of Israel,&#8221; or the Father of something else, they cannot twist away the title, &#8220;the Father&#8221; in Isaiah 9:6. There is only one Divine Father in the whole universe. Hence, &#8220;the everlasting Father&#8221; in Isaiah 9:6, regardless of how people twist it, must be the unique Divine Father in the Godhead.<p>5.The error of omission. The speaker did not say anything about 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&#8221; (ASV) and 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, &#8220;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&#8221; Probably he ignored dealing with this aspect of the truth because he has no way to answer without twisting the Scripture and ending up with two life-giving Spirits. The whole history and weight of exegesis on these two passages indicate (without theological speculation) that Christ is simply the Spirit.<p>What heresy to have two Divine Fathers and two life-giving Spirits! We must tell people of these heresies, and these heresies must be exposed. We are absolutely scriptural, but those who have two Divine Fathers and two life-giving Spirits as the result of twisting these verses are heretical. Let us wait and see how they can clear themselves from this charge.<h2 class=head1>5. A PROTEST CONCERNING HISTORICAL MISREPRESENTATION</h2><p>On behalf of Witness Lee and all the local churches, we go on record before the Christian public to protest against the meeting held at Melodyland on October 2, 1977. The speaker grossly misrepresented the truths of the gospel that we have experienced and proclaimed. Our speaking and writing are our response to these misrepresentations, lest silence be construed as agreement with the Melodyland meeting. The reason the speaker and his research associates make such false charges and distortions concerning what we believe is obviously ignorance on their part of what we believe and mean. This ignorance has led them into the error of misrepresentation. The areas of ignorance and misrepresentation are as follows:<h2 class=head2>A. Ignorance concerning Biblical Theology</h2><p>The speaker and his associates have read into our quotations of 2 Corinthians 3:17a, &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit,&#8221; and 1 Corinthians 15:45b, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving spirit,&#8221; and given them a modalistic meaning that we ourselves do not believe. In March of 1977, we had a personal talk with the speaker&#8217;s associates in which we related that our use of the above verses did not mean modalism. They refused to accept our clear testimony on this point.<p>Then we inquired of them if they were aware of the area in biblical theology called &#8220;Pneumatic Christology.&#8221; The associates of the speaker were totally ignorant that such an area existed in the study of biblical theology. We challenged them to go outside the local church and study the contemporary theological discussions on this subject.<p>The emphasis of &#8220;Pneumatic Christology&#8221; is a fresh attempt to come back to the simple and clear statements of the Bible concerning the action of Christ as the Spirit. An example of other biblical theologians speaking to this issue is Dr. Hendrikus Berkhof of the University of Leyden in Holland in his book, The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit. The following is a sample found on page 21:<p>The Spirit as the action of the exalted Christ: So far our main interest has been focused on the consequences of Christ&#8217;s being the bearer of the Spirit, and as such also the sender. Now we have to shift our attention and to lay full emphasis on that second aspect: Christ the sender of the Spirit, the Spirit sent by Christ. How are Christ and the Spirit related here? This difficult question is of the greatest importance. It has found different answers in the course of church history, and these answers have created different types of Christian life, institutional as well as individual.<p>Then continuing on pages 24 and 25 he says:<p>In the field of biblical theology, several studies have been published in the last years which throw a new light on the relation between the Spirit and Christ, primarily in the letters of Paul. From these studies and from an open-minded examination of the New Testament, we must draw the conclusion that we have to think of the Spirit in strictly christocentric terms. This means that we have to start where the first group starts and to say that the Spirit is always and everywhere the Spirit of Jesus Christ. When we go a step beyond the traditional position, it is not to weaken it but to strengthen it. That the Spirit is bound to Christ is far more true than is meant and expressed in classical pneumatology. In John 14:18, Jesus, aiming at the sending of the Spirit, says: &#8220;I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you.&#8221; We find a parallel saying in the last words of Matthew: &#8220;I am with you always, to the close of the age&#8221; (28:20). This identification of the Spirit with Christ is found in all the New Testament traditions. We think of 1 John 3:24 which says that we know Christ abides in us &#8220;by the Spirit which he has given us.&#8221; In the letters to the seven churches, it is the risen Christ who speaks, but who at the same time says: &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&#8221; (Rev. 2:7, etc.). We think, however, mainly of Paul&#8217;s words: &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17a). Some think that we have to reverse subject and predicate, and to translate: &#8220;Now the Spirit is Lord,&#8221; the Spirit wields lordship; but the word &#8220;Lord&#8221; in verses 17 and 18 always means Christ. He himself is the Spirit; as the close of verse 18 repeats: &#8220;this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.&#8221; Other features of this conception in Paul are found in 1 Corinthians 6:17: &#8220;he who is united to the Lord becomes one Spirit with him,&#8221; and in Romans 8:9-11, where the divine principle which dwells in the faithful alternately is called the Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. It is also clear that the Pauline expressions en Christoi and en pneumati are synonymous.<p>Dr. Berkhof&#8216;s book is sold at Melodyland Bookstore. In fact, we would encourage the speaker, his associates, the faculty and students of Melodyland School of Theology, and the Christian public to make an objective and honest study of the history of the exegesis of 1 Corinthians 6:17, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 2 Corinthians 3:17, Romans 8:9-11, and Acts 16:6-7 from the great expositors of the Bible in the past centuries to see whether on the level of experience others have not said the very things for which we have been charged as heretical.<h2 class=head2>B. Misrepresentation concerning the History of Modalism</h2><p>The speaker at Melodyland on October 2, 1977, said:<p>Witness Lee has perverted the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and has adopted an ancient church heresy known as Monarchianistic Modalism. That&#8217;s a fifty-cent word, but translated it boils down to this. There are two types of modalism, the logical person who realizes that God cannot be both Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at the same time and then they say God was first the Father, became the Son, and then became the Holy Spirit. The illogical ones recognize that the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit are spoken of at the same time and therefore try to say that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit somehow exist at the same time and yet are each other. That&#8217;s the two classic modes of modalistic theology...<p>With the above statement the speaker then charged Witness Lee with both of the classic heresies. The first classic mode is surely that type of modalism represented by Sabellius. The second classic mode of modalism which the speaker calls &#8220;illogical&#8221; is in fact not the second classic mode of modalism. All students of Christian doctrine know that the other classic mode of modalism is called dynamic modalism represented in the unitarian, Paul of Samosata, who denied the preexistence of Christ and reduced the Son and the Spirit to &#8220;virtues&#8221; or &#8220;powers&#8221; rather than &#8220;Persons&#8221; in the Godhead.<p>The speaker, however, misrepresented a man named Callistus as one who represented one of the classic modes of modalism, and utilized him to charge Witness Lee with a so-called classic heresy.<p>The section that the speaker twisted for his own use is found in Philip Schaff&#8217;s History of the Christian Church, Volume II, page 579. The following is what was referred to over the radio, October 8, 1977, by the speaker and his associates:<p>Callistus differed from the ditheistic separation of the Logos from God, but also from the Sabellian confusion of the Father and the Son, and insisted on the mutual indwelling (perichoresis) of the divine Persons; in other words, he sought the way from modalistic unitarianism to the Nicene trinitarianism; but he was not explicit and consistent in his statements. He excommunicated both Sabellius and Hippolytus; the Roman church sided with him, and made his name one of the most prominent among the ancient popes.<p>Firstly, according to Philip Schaff, Callistus is surely not represented here as one of the &#8220;classic modes of modalistic theology,&#8221; but on the contrary &#8220;sought the way from modalistic unitarianism to the Nicene Trinitarianism.&#8221; In fact, J. F. Bethune-Baker&#8217;s book The Early History of Christian Doctrine, pages 103-104, indicates that, with Callistus&#8217; statements related to the distinction of the Father and the Son, the essential principle of modalism is lost. Therefore, this is a direct misrepresentation of historical facts in the name of scholarship and research in order to label Witness Lee and the local churches with heresy.<p>Secondly, the speaker indicated that Callistus represented the illogical ones who recognize that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit somehow exist at the same time and yet are each other. This is an outright falsehood in relation to what Callistus actually believed according to Schaff. Callistus &#8220;insisted on the mutual indwelling (perichoresis) of the divine Persons.&#8221; The speaker represented Callistus as believing that the Father, Son, and Spirit are each other, but Callistus actually believed that the Father, Son, and Spirit are indwelling each other. The omission of the word &#8220;indwelling&#8221; by the speaker was a subtle falsehood. To say &#8220;are each other&#8221; is modalism. To say the divine Persons mutually indwell each other is the proper biblical understanding of the relationship between the Persons in the Godhead.<p>Therefore, the speaker&#8217;s so-called classic mode of illogical modalism is exposed as a fabrication of his own mind and not a fact in the history of doctrine. This is irresponsible misrepresentation in the name of research and scholarship in order to falsely charge Witness Lee and the local churches.<h1 class=msg>THE USE OF THE WORD MINGLE</h1><h2 class=head1>6. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE MINGLING</h2><p>Since the speaker at Melodyland is confused concerning the proper understanding of the mingling as taught by Witness Lee and the local churches, we take this opportunity to relate the scriptural and historical points concerning mingling.<p>Firstly, the truths in the New Testament, being spiritual and abstract, are often pictured by the types in the Old Testament. Concerning the testimony of the Old Testament, the type that portrays Christ mingled in His humanity and divinity is the meal or meat offering in Leviticus 2:1-16. Specifically, the one verse that uniquely brings together the humanity and divinity of Christ is Leviticus 2:4: &#8220;And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil&#8221; (ASV). Here two substances, fine flour and oil, which in type depict the humanity and divinity of Christ, are united in the most wondrous relationship. The word selected by the Holy Spirit to denote the mode of that relationship is mingled.<p>Secondly, the testimony of the New Testament concerning the mystery of the mingling of man with God is expressed in 1 Timothy 3:16 which declares that God manifest in the flesh is a great mystery. The New Testament, however, does not attempt to explain how the divinity and humanity of Christ are interrelated. Although no word is supplied in the pages of the New Testament to describe this mysterious inner relationship, the facts of the mystery are clearly presented: Christ is truly God and truly man, yet He is one Person. The Old Testament type of the &#8220;fine flour mingled with oil&#8221; portrays the facts of the New Testament revelation, and both type and facts must be held as a great mystery.<p>Also, in 1 Corinthians 6:17 the fact of a believer&#8217;s spirit being mingled with the Holy Spirit is clearly stated: &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; How could man&#8217;s spirit be one spirit with the Holy Spirit without being mingled? Let the speaker answer and describe the nature of this oneness of spirit with the Lord.<p>The relationship between the humanity and divinity of Christ is a divine mystery which cannot be fully explained or understood by man. To utter this mystery the Word of God in Leviticus 2:4 uses the term &#8220;mingled.&#8221; Early in church history this term was used in a proper sense by the church fathers, but in the fifth century it became associated with heresy and its proper meaning was damaged. In the ensuing church councils and creeds, non-scriptural and substitute terms were introduced. Consequently, the scriptural term received a wrong connotation and was lost to the common language of the church.<p>However, despite the historical and traditional problem concerning the term mingle as it describes the relationship of the humanity and divinity of Christ, the Word of God and the actual testimonies of several of the church fathers, reformers, and evangelical writers confirm the use of the term mingled as the unique scriptural term to convey and utter this mystery.<h1 class=msg>THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class=head1>7. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2><p>Why do we call ourselves &#8220;the church in Anaheim,&#8221; &#8220;the church in Huntington Beach,&#8221; or &#8220;the church in Los Angeles&#8221;? We have been fully misunderstood concerning this matter and even charged by the speaker at Melodyland with &#8220;enormous egotism.&#8221; This is mainly due to ignorance concerning God&#8217;s revelation of the church.<p>In the heart of God in eternity past was an &#8220;eternal purpose,&#8221; and the means by which this purpose would be fulfilled is called &#8220;the church&#8221; (Eph. 3:10-11). Therefore, this name &#8220;the church&#8221; came out of the heart of God. Then the Lord Jesus gave this same title to this same marvelous entity when He spoke in Matthew 16:18, &#8220;I will build my church.&#8221; In Revelation 2 and 3, the Holy Spirit is revealed again and again as speaking to &#8220;the churches.&#8221; Furthermore, throughout the narrative of Acts and the writings of the apostles, the same unique title &#8220;the church&#8221; or &#8220;the churches&#8221; is used repeatedly. No definitive adjectives are used before this title, denoting which church. There is only one church, &#8220;the church.&#8221;<p>Although this simple title-planned by God, spoken by the Lord, addressed by the Spirit, and referred to by the apostles-has been persistently misused and abused, we still would return to the Bible to call ourselves what the Triune God and the apostles have called us, &#8220;the church.&#8221; What church? The church. This does not mean that we are the church and others are not the members of the church. Every blood-washed, regenerated child of God is part of it. They were born into it. But many are not meeting as the church, but in a divided and confused situation. To prefix &#8220;the church&#8221; with adjectives, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, etc., and to meet as such is to divide the church and separate members one from another. To call it a &#8220;fellowship&#8221; or a &#8220;center&#8221; is to miss the mark. God wants His people today to forsake every divisive name and standing and to meet together with other Christians simply as the church in their locality. This is what the Bible shows us.<p>Let us consider God&#8217;s Word. In the beginning of the New Testament, in Matthew, and at the end of the New Testament, in Revelation, the Lord Jesus Himself speaks of the church. However, in Matthew it is singular (&#8220;my church&#8221;), and in Revelation it is plural (&#8220;the seven churches&#8221;). In Matthew, He is speaking of the one universal church, whereas in Revelation He is speaking of the local churches. The one universal church must have an expression, and it is expressed practically in many localities as the local churches. &#8220;Local churches&#8221; is not their title, but merely a description of their nature.<p>Now notice the passage in Revelation 1:11. The Lord said, &#8220;What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches.&#8221; Then He immediately proceeded to mention seven cities: &#8220;To Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&#8221; The Lord, as always, spoke very precisely and meaningfully. He said seven churches, and then mentioned seven cities, indicating that the city is equivalent to the church, or, in other words, the city is the boundary, the jurisdiction, of a local church. Nothing could be more clear.<p>This principle is repeated by the apostles in many instances in the Epistles and the Acts, and it is never violated. The Scripture says, &#8220;The church which was at Jerusalem&#8221; (Acts 8:1), never, &#8220;The churches which were at Jerusalem.&#8221; It says, &#8220;The church that was at Antioch&#8221; (Acts 13:1), never, &#8220;The churches that were at Antioch.&#8221; If there was one city, there was only one church. When the Scripture refers to a district, with many cities, it consistently refers to the churches (plural) in that district: e.g., &#8220;the churches in Judea&#8221; (Gal. 1:22), the churches of Syria and Cilicia (Acts 15:41), &#8220;the churches of Asia&#8221; (1 Cor. 16:19), and so forth. In one district there may be many churches, but in one city there can only be one church.<p>The saved ones are the called-out ones, but since they are still living among men, the Lord gathers them in the place where they are living. If you are living in Dallas, you must simply meet together with the other saved ones as the church in Dallas. If you are living in Seattle, you must simply meet with the other Christians as the church in Seattle. How simple and pure this arrangement is! There is no room for human opinion or human choice. The church that is built in Dallas is just the one church; the church that is built in any place is the same church, for the church is one in the whole universe. There is no difference in nature, but only in geography. If all God&#8217;s people could see this, there would be no divisions. Only geography is unavoidable. All other distinctions separating Christians are absolutely unnecessary and violate the unity of the church. Herein we find the wisdom of God. In one locality after another, in order to keep the unity of the church, God establishes only one church.<p>As further proof, consider Acts 14:23: &#8220;And having chosen them elders in each church...&#8221; Now compare this with Titus 1:5: &#8220;And establish elders in each city.&#8221; In Acts Paul says &#8220;elders in each church,&#8221; and in Titus he says &#8220;elders in each city.&#8221; These verses prove that the elders of a city are the elders of a church. They also prove that the boundary of the church is just the boundary of the city. If the church is smaller than the city or greater than the city, it is not a proper local church as delineated by the Scriptures.<p>Our standard must be the Word of God. We must be true to the light God has given, or our conscience will give us no rest. The proper standing for all genuine Christians as the one church in each locality is clearly set forth in God&#8217;s Word. There is no need to search for it, we only need to return to it. That is what we have done, and we are being condemned for it. But we strongly reject all charges of being divisive. We are simply standing on the ground where all Christians are one. This is not Witness Lee&#8217;s church. It does not belong to him, and he has never attempted to take it over. To make this charge manifests an utter ignorance of the facts.<p>The confusion found in Christianity today is mainly due to this matter. Christians are meeting together, perhaps ignorantly and unconsciously, on the wrong standing, a divisive standing, according to their own taste and choice. The sects and denominations of today could no longer exist if all would come together to express the one church in each city according to the Scriptures. Therefore, anyone who insists on keeping the denominations is divisive. In the light of this truth, the local churches are not dividing the Body of Christ, as we have been charged. The responsibility of division lies upon the denominations, fellowships, centers, and other groups who do not care for the practical unity of the Body in their locality. If a woman is married to Mr. Jones and yet insists on calling herself Mrs. Smith, it proves there is a serious problem. Such a practice would be extremely objectionable and even intolerable to Mr. Jones. The wife, if she would be proper, must return to her standing as Mrs. Jones and commence calling herself Mrs. Jones. The application to today&#8216;s situation is clear.<p>May the Lord lead many more of His children into the practical expression of the unity of His church.<h2 class=head1>8. THE TRUTH CONCERNING GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH</h2><p>Ephesians 1:22-23 says that God &#8220;gave Him [Christ] to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His body....&#8221; Hence, there is a marvelous Person in this universe: Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body. Paul in his Epistles, especially in Ephesians and Colossians, speaks much of this divinely human Person in the figure of a complete man, the Head with the Body. Just as in a normal human being, the body shares the same life and nature with the head; so in the relationship of the church with Christ, the church partakes of the very divine life and nature of Christ. Otherwise, she could not be His Body. Verses such as Ephesians 4:15-16 and Colossians 2:19 further substantiate the fact by showing how all the Body is built up by the life supply flowing from the Head.<p>To the speaker who has recently said that &#8220;we cannot participate in God,&#8221; we answer, &#8220;In His Godhead, no; but in His life and nature, most assuredly and blessedly.&#8221; To the Scripture already presented, we add 2 Peter 1:4, which says in plain words, &#8220;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature...&#8221; What could be more clear? <p>In addition, the Scriptures tell us more. Christ is not only the Head, but also the Body. Very few Christians have seen this revelation in Scripture. Yet it is not obscure. I need not interpret, but only read 1 Corinthians 12:12, &#8220;For as the body is one, and hath many members and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.&#8221; Paul is speaking of the body with its many members, and says that although the members are many, they are one body. Then he makes a startling statement: &#8220;So also is Christ.&#8221; We would have said, &#8220;So also is the church.&#8221; But the inspired writer said that this one Body with its many members is none other than Christ. To God&#8217;s Word we say, &#8220;Amen.&#8221; But in the figure of our physical body, is it not so? Is my body not me, just as my head is me? When anyone touches my body, he touches me. When anyone hurts my body, he hurts me. The way my body is treated is the way I am treated, for my body is no less me than my head. The head certainly holds a distinct and unique place in the body, yet it is so absolutely identified with the body that the body together with the head bears the same name. So it is with Christ and the church. This is the inspired word in 1 Corinthians 12:12.<p>Therefore, it is perfectly scriptural to assert that Christ is no longer merely the individual Christ, although He holds alone His lofty and distinct position as Head of the Body, but is now the corporate Christ as the Body with all its members. Through His death and resurrection, He gained the church, His Body, as His fullness, His corporate expression. Where the church is practically expressed, there He is in practical, corporate expression. The speaker at Melodyland said, &#8220;There is no corporate Christ.&#8221; But the author of these words is ignorant of the revelation in Paul&#8217;s Epistles.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in John 12:24 reveals more concerning this matter: &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; The metaphor is clear. A grain of wheat, by being sown into the earth, germinates and rises in resurrection, producing many more grains of identical life and nature. The one grain has been multiplied from one to thousands of grains like itself, both inwardly and outwardly. The speaker said that, &#8220;Jesus Christ has not expanded into thousands and thousands of persons at all.&#8221; Again, the author of these words does not know the Scriptures, for the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain, that through death and resurrection would be multiplied, expanded, many times. Paul in Romans goes on to tell us that we will all &#8220;be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren&#8221; (Rom. 8:29). We will be fully like Him; He will have many brothers just like Himself. This is the marvelous grace of God&#8217;s salvation.<p>The obvious conclusion, then, is that since Christ is embodied and expressed in so many members as His Body, and since Christ is God, then the church is none other than God manifest in the flesh. This, the speaker said, is &#8220;the last great heresy of Mr. Lee.&#8221; But, again, the author of these words is destitute of sight.<p>Consider 1 Timothy 3:15-16, which speaks in plain words concerning God manifest in the flesh. &#8220;But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.&#8221; Verse 16, we acknowledge, refers to Christ, for He undoubtedly is God manifest in the flesh. Christ also was the One who was justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory. But we say also that this verse refers to the church as well. Allow us to prove it. The context of the whole passage is the church. Verse 15, the preceding verse, is speaking of the house of God, the church. The context of the whole chapter is the qualifications of the overseers and deacons in the church. Then this chapter on the church with its offices is concluded with verse 16: &#8220;Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.&#8221;<p>Moreover, the order of the items following &#8220;God was manifest in the flesh&#8221; further substantiates our affirmation. If this verse were speaking only of Christ, the last item, &#8220;received up into glory,&#8221; should precede &#8220;preached unto the Gentiles,&#8221; for Christ was received up before He was preached. Since it comes last, it coincides with the history of the church, for the church at the last, just like her Lord at the first, will be received up into glory. Hence, both Christ and the church, or we should say, Christ with the church, is God manifest in the flesh.<p>The apostle Paul said, &#8220;Now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. For to me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:20-21). Surely this means that God as Christ was manifest in his flesh. It does not mean that Paul became deity, as we have been charged with promulgating concerning ourselves. He did not mean that, and neither do we. When we speak of the church being God manifest in the flesh, we mean, as Paul, that God as Christ is manifested and magnified through us.<p>Finally, consider the case of the meeting described in 1 Corinthians 14:24-25. &#8220;But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned,...the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed&#8221; (ASV). This is none other than God manifest in the flesh. We often have the experience of this kind of meeting with this kind of issue in the local churches.<h1 class=msg>THE DEVIATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY</h1><h2 class=head1>9. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE HISTORIC CHRISTIAN CHURCH</h2><p>In a message on Witness Lee and the local church, given recently at Melodyland, the speaker made several references to &#8220;Historic Christianity.&#8221; He said concerning the members of the local churches, &#8220;Our responsibility as Christians is to reprove them, rebuke them, and exhort them that they may turn...back again to Historic Christianity, because they are not in it now.&#8221; I fully agree that the local churches are not in what he calls &#8220;Historic Christianity.&#8221; In this brief essay I will try explain why.<p>The speaker did not give us his definition of &#8220;Historic Christianity.&#8221; Since he relied so heavily for his material upon The Mindbenders by Jack Sparks and recommended it so highly, I assume he agrees with its basic premise. &#8220;The Historic Christian Church,&#8221; says Sparks, is the &#8220;Church [of] the past&#8221;; the Church of &#8220;those who have gone before&#8221;; the Church of &#8220;the creeds, confessions, and writings of the saints&#8221;; and the Church which uses the creeds and councils as &#8220;ancient landmarks&#8221; to interpret the Bible and &#8220;the faith.&#8221; This kind of mentality can say, &#8220;Today, all orthodox Christendom holds to the Nicene Creed. Anyone who does not, embraces heterodoxy.&#8221; The truth concerning &#8220;the Historic Christian Church&#8221; is that she is essentially a conglomeration of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, and takes as the standard of faith and practice the creeds and councils of the first five centuries. This &#8220;church,&#8221; if such she can be called, is a church which relies fully on the past. Instead of relying solely upon the Bible as the only &#8220;yardstick for truth,&#8221; she mingles the Bible with the ancient creeds, and if a choice is necessary between the two, takes her stand with the creeds, not the Word.<p>The same council which composed the Nicene Creed also decreed in Canon III that the clergy should not marry. This was in fulfillment of 1 Timothy 4:1-3: &#8220;In latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and teachings of demons...forbidding to marry&#8221; (Gk.). How, then, could such a council be considered reliable in interpreting the Word of God? When Martin Luther was required to appear before the Diet of Worms, he was told he had &#8220;no right to call into question the most holy orthodox faith...confirmed by the sacred councils, [and] defined by the Church.&#8221; To this he replied:<p>Unless I am convicted by Scripture and plain reason-I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other-my conscience is captive to the Word of God.<p>If Luther had been limited by &#8220;the Historic Christian Church,&#8221; there would have been no Reformation; the truth and experience of justification by faith would not have been recovered; the Bible would not have been liberated from its Latin prison; and we would all still be in the Dark Ages.<p>The creeds and councils do not equal the Bible. For example, the Apostles&#8217; and Nicene Creeds say practically nothing about the Holy Spirit. It is clear that when the Council of Nicea met in A.D. 325, the truth regarding the seven Spirits in Revelation was still not recognized. But today we are in the age of Revelation, and while in substance and existence the Spirit is one, for God&#8217;s move upon the earth in this period of division and degradation, the Spirit is intensified sevenfold (Rev. 1:4). Surely, this is the up-to-date revelation concerning the Spirit. Are we then to be limited to the dim light men had when the Nicene Creed was written?<p>Today, on many matters, the light is shining brightly. In A.D. 325 the Nicene Creed was like a small pair of shoes tailored to fit the small feet of the church in that day. But the church&#8217;s feet have grown. We can no longer get our large feet into those small shoes. Even in the sixteenth century, Luther&#8217;s spiritual feet had far outgrown those small shoes of the councils and the creeds. If he could not wear the shoes of &#8220;Historic Christianity&#8221; four hundred years ago, how much more have we outgrown them today! Only the revelation of the entire Bible can afford a pair of shoes adequate to fit the church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. <p>Again quoting from the book which the Melodyland speaker so highly recommends, the author says: <p class=indent1>The [historic] Church has failed...miserably; it has moved an embarrassingly great distance away from its original foundations; [and its condition is referred to as] this apostasy. In the Protestant Reformation, [he says] justification by faith in Christ and a renewed emphasis on Holy Scripture were gained. [But] we have never fully regained worship. Authority in the Church has not been reclaimed. And whatever happened to our oneness as a body?<p>Surely, any church which has failed miserably, has moved from its original foundations, is in apostasy, is short of adequate worship and authority, and has lost the oneness of the Body, is in a divided, degraded condition. What is needed is a recovery of the &#8220;original foundations,&#8221; a recovery from &#8220;this apostasy,&#8221; a recovery of the reality of worship, a recovery of &#8220;authority in the Church,&#8221; and a recovery of the oneness of the Body in its expression. When the speaker says we in the local churches are not in &#8220;Historic Christianity,&#8221; we agree with him. Historic Christianity is in exactly the poor condition Jack Sparks says it is, and we have no desire to either be in it or return to it.<p>I myself am not without some experience in &#8220;Historic Christianity.&#8221; I was ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal Church and am presently listed in her clerical directory as a priest in good standing. I have lived and breathed the atmosphere of the Book of Common Prayer. The tradition of the &#8220;church&#8221; and the ecumenical creeds are quite familiar to me. But what I finally came to realize was that what is called the church of history, from the first century until now, has always been composed of two widely different classes of people: those who are merely nominal, traditional, and formal and those who are real, vital, and living. There have been in every age those who represented a real, vital, and living reaction to the nominal, traditional, and formal kind of Christianity. In the sixteenth century Luther and others were the living alternative to dead, traditional Christianity. There is also an alternative today.<h2 class=head1>10. THE TRUTH CONCERNING BABYLON</h2><p>It was recently alleged by a speaker at Melodyland that the local churches have called Melodyland, &#8220;Babylon.&#8221; I do not know where this can be found in print or when it was ever said. It may be that some irresponsible person said it, just as irresponsible people from Melodyland have called us a cult. Wherever the elements of Babylon are present, there is Babylon. If the elements of Babylon are present in Melodyland, Babylon is there. If the elements of Babylon are present in the local churches, Babylon is also there. <p>In the Bible, the word Babylon is equal to the word Babel. Babel is first mentioned in Genesis 11 where the tower of Babel issued in division and confusion. Many Christians today are in division and confusion. That is, they are in Babylon and do not even realize it. If you are in the division and confusion of today&#8216;s present situation, you are in Babylon. Speaking of Babylon, Revelation 18:4 says, &#8220;Come out of her, My people.&#8221;<p>There are those who wonder why the local churches call the present Christian situation, Babylon. It is because the present Christian situation is filled with division issuing in confusion. In the New Testament the church was one. Today, however, the church has been divided into many different segments. These divisions have caused confusion. Whether they realize it or not, those who are in the divided situation are in Babylon.<h2 class=head1>11. THE TRUTH CONCERNING DENOMINATIONS </h2><p>First, we must ask, &#8220;What is a denomination?&#8221; A denomination begins as a division brought about by Christians exercising personal preferences. The preferences include certain leaders, doctrines, practices, association with a certain race, etc. Eventually those with like preference form a group and denominate themselves by taking a name. Thus, you have the Lutheran Church, the Baptist Church, the African Methodist Church, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, ad infinitum. All such denominations are unscriptural divisions of the Body of Christ. We will now prove this from the pure Word of God.<p>From the book of Acts through Revelation, it is a simple, obvious truth of biblical history that all the Christians in one city formed only one church. In Ephesus, in A.D. 60, it was absolutely unnecessary to consider which kind of church to join. All the saints there were one as the church in Ephesus (Eph. 1:1; Rev. 1:11). A first-century Christian, visiting the churches, would have encountered no division among Christians in a city until he came to Corinth.<p>Twenty years ago as a Baptist pastor, I questioned within myself, &#8220;Specifically what &#8216;body&#8217; is it that Paul said should not be divided in 1 Corinthians 12:25?&#8221; The context of the chapter and the whole book makes it clear. It was the body of all the Christians in Corinth who daily functioned together as the one church in that city. Several facts prove this point. (1) The book was written to &#8220;the church of God which is at Corinth&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:2). This clearly includes all the believers in the city. (2) Paul had received a report of quarrels and divisions resulting from the saints&#8217; preferences for various leaders (1 Cor. 1:11-12). (3) Paul rebuked the divisive ones on at least three major points. First, to divide the Body is to divide Christ (1 Cor. 1:13). Second, to be divisive is fleshly (1 Cor. 3:3-4). Third, by not discerning that the Body is one, they were suffering great loss at the Lord&#8217;s table (1 Cor. 11:18, 29-31).<p>In Galatians 5:19-21, Paul also condemns division as a work of the flesh, categorizing it with immorality and idolatry. The last two words of verse 20 should be translated &#8220;divisions, sects.&#8221; Since denominations, groups, centers, etc., divide the Body of Christ, they are works of the flesh. This is the inevitable conclusion from the Word of God.<p>Deep within him, every denominational Christian&#8217;s conscience testifies that he is, in fact, divided from other Christians by the organization to which he belongs. All agree there will be no denominations in the New Jerusalem. Even the unsaved recognize that the denominations are divisions. I have often been challenged by the statement, &#8220;If you are all Christians, why are there so many different &#8216;churches&#8217; with some opposing each other?&#8221; In John 17:21, Jesus prayed, &#8220;That they all may be one...that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.&#8221; This demands a visible unity of all Christians in a locality. Otherwise, the world sees not oneness, but division.<p>We in the local churches repudiate all division. After fourteen years&#8217; experience in the local churches, I can testify strongly that we are not a division and we have no division among us. Neither are we dividing the Body of Christ as our opposers falsely accuse. Rather, we are open to all born-again believers.<p>We call upon all Christians to drop their sectarian preferences which bring about the formation of denominated groups and divide the Body of Christ. Drop your preference of denominational names, certain leaders, doctrines, practices, etc. All the saints in one city would then be one church without any element of division. One group of saints with the one Christ would form one unique church in a city. <h2 class=head4>&#8220;How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221; (Psa. 133:1)</h2><h1 class=msg>THE NATURE OF MAN</h1><h2 class=head1>12. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE NATURE OF MAN</h2><p>The body of man was created pure and good (Gen. 1:31); there was nothing inherently evil or sinful about it. But according to the Bible, the body is different from the flesh, which in the Scriptures has at least three meanings: the flesh of our physical body (John 6:55); the fallen, corrupted body contaminated by sin (Rom. 7:18); and the fallen man (Rom. 3:20). God did not create fallen flesh; He created a body of flesh, blood, and bones. When man fell, sin, the evil nature of Satan, came into man&#8217;s body, transmuting it into the flesh. This flesh is called &#8220;the flesh of sin&#8221; (Rom. 8:3, Gk.), and the fallen body is called &#8220;the body of sin&#8221; (Rom. 6:6) and &#8220;the body of this death&#8221; (Rom. 7:24). Because the God-created body has been corrupted and ruined by sin and transmuted into the flesh, all kinds of lusts are now in the members of our body (Gal. 5:24; Col. 3:5).<p>First John 3:10 speaks of &#8220;the children of the devil.&#8221; To be a child of the devil means to be begotten of the devil and hence to have the devil&#8217;s life and nature. A child of the devil has his source in the devil. Cain was of the evil one, the devil, Satan; so is everyone who commits sin (1 John 3:12, 8). In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.&#8221; The fact that the devil is the father of fallen man must mean that in some way fallen man has been begotten of the devil. Both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus called the religious ones a &#8220;generation of vipers&#8221; (Matt. 3:7; 23:33), that is, the offspring of vipers. All these verses indicate that fallen men are children of Satan, possessing Satan&#8217;s life and nature.<p>Now we must ask this question: In what part of their being are fallen people begotten the children of the devil with the satanic life and nature? The answer is found in the book of Romans. Romans 7:5 says that &#8220;the motions of sins...work in our members,&#8221; referring, of course, to the members of our physical body. Verse 23 says, &#8220;But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.&#8221; In verse 18 Paul declared that in his flesh was &#8220;no good thing,&#8221; and in verse 20 he said that sin dwelt in him. When we examine the verbs used by Paul to portray the action of sin, we see that the sin which is in us behaves exactly like a person. This sin enters (5:12), reigns (6:12), lords it over us (6:14), revives (7:9), takes occasion, deceives, kills (7:11), dwells in us (7:17), and does things in us (7:20). All these are the activities of a person. Hence, we may infer that the sin that dwells in us is the personification of Satan and that it is in the flesh, the corrupted body, that fallen men are begotten of the devil. Sin is the evil nature of Satan. We may even say that sin is Satan. Because sin dwells in our body and because sin is the nature of Satan, it is not too much to say that Satan as sin dwells in our fallen body. This does not mean that Satan has no objective existence apart from man&#8217;s flesh. It simply means that the sin dwelling in our fallen bodies is the personification of Satan himself and that, in this sense, Satan dwells in our flesh.<p>Two further points! First, the above statements regarding the presence of Satan in the flesh have absolutely nothing to do with gnosticism. According to gnosticism, matter is inherently evil. For the gnostic, man&#8217;s physical body, being material, is intrinsically evil; and salvation consists in the emancipation of the spirit from the body. Taking our stand with the Scriptures, we have always condemned the teachings of gnosticism. Man&#8217;s physical body is not inherently evil, but it has been defiled through the sin that dwells in it.<p>Second, the fact that a believer&#8217;s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19) does not mean that sin as the personification of Satan and the lusts of the flesh are no longer in our flesh. In the same book where Paul says that our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, he also speaks of fornication being among the members of the church (1 Cor. 5:1, 9-11). Surely this indicates that the element of sin, the personification of Satan, is still in the flesh of the believers. The body which is the temple of the Holy Spirit is the created body which has been recovered. But in this body there are still the lusts, which have their origin in the devil. For this reason, Paul admonished the churches in Galatia, &#8220;Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh&#8221; (Gal. 5:16).<h1 class=msg>SALVATION</h1><h2 class=head1>13. THE TRUTH CONCERNING GOD COMING INTO MAN</h2><p>The desire of God&#8217;s heart is to come into man so that He may have His dwelling place with man. This desire is expressed in Exodus 25:8, where the Lord, speaking of the tabernacle as a type of His real dwelling place, says, &#8220;And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.&#8221; God&#8217;s desire to dwell with man is also seen in Isaiah 66:1-2, where the Lord, longing for a house, a place of rest, says, &#8220;To this man will I look, the poor and contrite in spirit, who trembleth at my word&#8221; (Heb.). Surely this passage indicates that God intends to come into man for His rest.<p>What is foreshadowed in the Old Testament is fulfilled in the New Testament. Christ, the Word of God, became flesh and tabernacled among us (John 1:1, 14, Gk.). When Jesus was on earth, He was God&#8217;s temple (John 2:19, 21). In Him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Col. 2:9). However, when Christ was on earth, God was only among us; He was not yet in us.<p>The change from God&#8217;s being among us to His being in us is seen in John 14. Although in Christ&#8217;s incarnation God was among us, His desire was to come into us. For this reason, in John 14 the Lord Jesus spoke of another Comforter, who would be able to be in us. In verse 17 He said that the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, or reality, was with us, but that He would be in us. As the context of verses 16-20 indicates, the Spirit of reality is the reality of Christ. Therefore, the Spirit in us (v. 17) is Christ in us (v. 20). Speaking of the day of His resurrection, Christ says in verse 20, &#8220;At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.&#8221; By His incarnation Christ could be among us, but by His resurrection He could come into us. Today, every genuine Christian has Jesus Christ Himself living within him (2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 2:20). As John 14:23 indicates, the Father and the Son together make Their abode with the one who loves the Son, and thus God&#8217;s desire to come into man is fulfilled. Hereafter, we need to abide in Him and He in us (John 15:4).<p>The revelation of John 14 is developed in the Epistles. First John 3:24 reveals that we can dwell in God and that God can dwell in us. Here we see the fact of the mutual dwelling: God in man and man in God. In the light of this verse, how can anyone say that God does not desire to come into man? First John 4:15 says, &#8220;Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.&#8221; God has come into us to dwell in us. What a glorious reality! <p>A number of portions from the Epistles of Paul confirm this truth. Romans 8:10 says that Christ is in us, and the following verse reveals that the Spirit of God dwells in us. In 1 Corinthians 3:16 we see that the church in a locality (cf. 1 Cor. 1:2) is the temple of God indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Second Corinthians 6:16 says that the saints are the temple of the living God, who dwells in them. According to Galatians, Christ is revealed in us and is formed in us (1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19). Ephesians 4:6 indicates that the Father is in us; Colossians 1:27, that Christ, the Son, is in us; and Galatians 4:6, that the Spirit is in us. Hallelujah, the Triune God is in us! The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all dwell in us as one to be our life and our everything for the satisfaction of the desire of God&#8217;s heart to come into man and to dwell with him forever.<p>Perhaps the clearest and fullest revelation of God&#8217;s desire to dwell in man is found in Ephesians chapter three. In this chapter Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power by His Spirit in our inner man, so that Christ may dwell in our hearts and that we might be filled with all the fullness of God (vv. 16-19). If it were not the desire of the Triune God to dwell in man, why would He inspire the apostle Paul to pray that Christ may dwell in our hearts and that we would be filled with all the fullness of God? Paul&#8217;s prayer was the expression of God&#8217;s intention, and the answer to this prayer through the loving cooperation of the believers in Christ today will bring about the fulfillment of God&#8217;s desire to come into us, to dwell in us, and to fill us with all His fullness, so that He and we may enjoy mutual rest and satisfaction for eternity. The Triune God not only intends to come into us-He has done so. And we are enjoying His indwelling. Praise Him!<h1 class=msg>THE BIBLE</h1><h2 class=head1>14. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>After hearing a recent message given at Melodyland, I was quite troubled concerning the remarks about Witness Lee and the study of God&#8217;s Word in the local churches. The speaker&#8217;s remarks reveal that he knows little of the real situation, and I question whether he has ever attended a meeting.<p>&#8220;How many have your Bibles here?&#8221; the speaker asked in that meeting at Melodyland. After the Bibles and hands were raised, he commented, &#8220;Not enough!&#8221; But I have observed that in all the local church meetings, everyone brings his Bible. In my experience as a pastor I found this situation at Melodyland to be typical, revealing not only neglect to bring the Bible to the meeting, but more than that, neglect to open the Bible daily and spend time in individual Bible study. The speaker, while addressing that same audience, and knowing very little of the lives of those in the local churches, made this accusation: &#8220;The local church does not have individualized Bible study. All study is exactly in harmony with Witness Lee.&#8221; On the contrary, however, my experience and observation these past six years in the church in Los Angeles has been the opposite. My own individual study of the Word of God has increased and surpassed that which I did as a seminary student and as a pastor. Also, I have observed that this is the experience of those who are in the local churches in Orange County and throughout the world. I have to say also that I praise the Lord for Bible study in harmony with Witness Lee. Having had the opportunity to sit under the ministry of some of the best Bible teachers, no one that I know of ministers the riches of the Word like this man. And yet, it is ironic that rather than receive these abundant riches, there are those who would rather occupy themselves with the same art as the Pharisees and scribes of the Lord&#8217;s day who sought only to find fault, &#8220;...that they might find an accusation against him&#8221; (Luke 6:7).<p>The speaker went on to deride the Recovery Version of the Bible. He says, &#8220;One of the other traits that mark this as cultic is that they have in their so-called Bible studies Recovery Versions of the Bible.&#8221; Does the translating of the Bible make the translator cultic? What a slander this is! He goes on, &#8220;The Recovery Version consists of the text of Scripture, sometimes altered or added to by Lee.&#8221; I have had six years of Greek and three years of Hebrew, and I find that the Recovery Version is an accurate and true translation of the original language of the Bible, not the Scripture text &#8220;sometimes altered or added to.&#8221; In comparison, Letters to Street Christians, a paraphrase of the Epistles, whose author, Jack Sparks, the writer of The Mindbenders is endorsed by the speaker, is written in language that not only is of the street, but at times goes into the gutter. I would be ashamed to give a copy to my sister, mother, wife, or daughter.<p>Having spent fourteen years under some of the best Bible expositors, I was surprised when I came to the church in Los Angeles to find that the Lord had gone on and had opened the Word of God through the ministry of Witness Lee in a way that was far beyond what I had seen or heard. For this rich ministry of the Word I am grateful because this ministry has changed my life and living.<h2 class=head1>15. A PROTEST CONCERNING BIBLE RESEARCH</h2><p>In the meeting at Melodyland opposing Witness Lee and the local churches, the speaker made a very serious charge. He said, &#8220;One of the other traits that mark this [the local churches] as cultic is that they have in their so-called Bible studies Recovery Versions of the Bible. The Recovery Version consists of the text of Scripture, sometimes altered or added to by Lee.&#8221; <p>He is charging Witness Lee with altering and adding to the text of the Scripture. We want to answer this charge strongly and clearly. I personally, together with Witness Lee and two other brothers, am responsible for the text of the Recovery Versions. I can state with absolute certainty that the words of the text have never been altered or added to. Every week we meet together and cover a large table, four feet wide and eight feet long, with all kinds of versions of the Bible, together with the inter-linear Greek-English text and numerous word studies and lexicons. Our goal is to ascertain from the original language, by comparison with many versions, and with the help of word studies and lexicons, the most precise wording in modern English to utter the sacred text. We do this work very strictly, carefully, and prayerfully, word by word, phrase by phrase, verse by verse.<p>Every time before we translate, we pray, &#8220;Lord, renew our minds and cover us with Your precious blood. Keep us fully in the Spirit, and may Your Word come forth just as You would want it.&#8221; We seek to be those who are poor and contrite in spirit, who tremble at His word (Isa. 66:2, Heb.), and not be &#8220;as many, which corrupt the word of God&#8221; (2 Cor. 2:17). Thus, we are absolutely not altering the text or adding anything to it. We consider our version to be the most accurate. <p>We ask the speaker at Melodyland to point out which word, which verse, in which chapter, we have altered or added. Let him show us, if he can, one instance in the Recovery Version that is not true to the original language of the Bible. He has made a serious, and we believe, a reckless and unsupported charge. <p>Because of the nature of this charge, having to do with the Word of God and our fundamental faith, we declare that this is something for which the speaker is legally responsible. We all know that if anyone alters or adds to the Word of God, it is a most despicable and abominable thing, deserving of the curse of God (Rev. 22:18-19). So to charge us with such a sinful act is not a light matter. We must make this matter very clear. We ask the speaker to respond. If he really considers that some part of our text is at fault, he should point out specifically the problem. If he is unable to do this, he certainly should apologize and make public rectification, for he has made such a gross charge in public.<p>Moreover, the speaker says that the fact that we have made another version of the Bible is &#8220;one of the...traits that mark [the local churches] as cultic.&#8221; But, we ask, &#8220;Is it cultic to have another version?&#8221; Because some heretical cult like the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses have their own translation, does it make us cultic because we have been burdened to produce another version? This is not sound reasoning. Because the unbelievers build houses and we also build houses, does that make us unbelievers? &#8220;Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment&#8221; (John 7:24).<p>Furthermore, the speaker at Melodyland, in a mocking tone, said that he &#8220;was not under the impression that the text [of the Bible] had been lost, but according to Witness Lee it has now been recovered.&#8221; At no time have we ever said that the text of the Bible has been either lost or recovered. This is the speaker&#8217;s unfounded sarcasm. We praise God that the text of the Bible has been preserved through all the centuries. We have chosen to call our version of the Bible the Recovery Version because God today is in the process of recovering the testimony of His church among His people, and we are in His recovery. May the Lord vindicate His testimony.<h2 class=head1>16. A PROTEST CONCERNING BIBLE INTERPRETATION</h2><p>It is an understatement to say that the speaker at Melodyland has a blind spot, which becomes obvious in the way he quotes the Bible. He omits what is in the blind spot and quotes only what he can see. This is due to what we call deductive reasoning. With deductive reasoning, one begins with a premise which he already holds. He then brings it to the Bible, and because he already has the premise, he quotes only what agrees with the premise and omits what disagrees with the premise.<p>Take for instance 2 Corinthians 3:17: &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; The speaker at Melodyland brings the premise to this verse that Christ cannot be Spirit. He begins with that premise, so he reads it like this: &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit,&#8221; but all the time he knows in his mind that the Lord here cannot be Christ, because he already has the premise that Christ cannot be the Spirit. This is so even though in this passage the word &#8220;Lord&#8221; can absolutely be proved to mean Christ. It can be proved beyond the shadow of a doubt to anyone who does not have a blind spot, that in this passage &#8220;the Lord&#8221; is Christ.<p>In chapter three, verse 14, Paul says that the veil is taken away by Christ. Then he says in verse 16, &#8220;Nevertheless, when it [the heart] shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.&#8221; Is the Lord who takes away the veil in verse 16 different from the Christ who removes the veil in verse 14? Is the Lord who takes the veil away in verse 16 Christ or someone else? Surely the Lord spoken of is Christ. &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; You can only arrive at a different conclusion if you have a big blind spot.<p>The speaker at Melodyland quoted John 1:1 according to his premise. These are his words: &#8220;Witness Lee says the Son is the Father. He is? If the Son is the Father, you&#8217;ve got a terrible problem with John 1:1. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was face to face with God. Who was He face to face with?&#8221; Then he makes the joke: &#8220;A cosmic mirror looking at Himself?&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t finish quoting John 1:1; he only quotes the first part, which says, &#8220;The Word was with God.&#8221; The blind spot causes him to omit the last part, which says, &#8220;And the Word was God.&#8221;<p>The teacher at Melodyland has no problem with the aspect of the three. He does have a problem with the aspect of one. I have never heard him refer to the aspect of one, although I have heard him speak a number of times. He always refers to the aspect of the three of the Trinity, never to the aspect of the one of the Trinity.<p>It is the same with Isaiah 9:6: &#8220;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&#8221; Quoting the Melodyland speaker again: &#8220;Ah, says Witness Lee-there it is. The everlasting Father is Jesus. He should take some lessons in Hebrew, and he should take some lessons in what the Jews meant when they wrote titles.&#8221; I would like to ask why he didn&#8217;t give us the lesson in Hebrew. We are open to any lesson that is valid. We will listen to anything that is genuine. Why did he not give us the Hebrew lesson? I am disappointed. And what did the Jews mean when they quoted titles?<p>I do not know Hebrew, but I can read English. For instance, I have read Isaiah in three volumes by Edward J. Young, a man whose credentials are impeccable in the matter of Hebrew. He was for many years head of the Old Testament Department at Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia, one of the most conservative, fundamental seminaries in the United States. It says on the jacket of his book that he writes not primarily concerning textual problems but with the meaning of the text in view. On the section where it says in Isaiah 9:6, &#8220;And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father,&#8221; this is what he says:<p>The thought is that the Child is worthy to bear these names, and that they are accurate descriptions and designations of His being and character. In the Bible the name indicates the character, essence or nature of a person or object. [He is telling us what the speaker at Melodyland failed to tell us concerning the meaning of the title.] When, therefore, it is stated that He shall be called, we are to understand that the following names are descriptive of the Child and deserve to be borne by Him....To maintain with George Adam Smith that the text merely says he will be called, not that he actually will be what the names indicate, would be a gross misunderstanding of the nature of the prophecy, indeed, of the nature of the Biblical language generally.<p>I would ask, do the words in Isaiah 9:6 mean what they say? Take all the words and ask concerning each one-does it mean what it says? &#8220;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.&#8221; Does this really mean a child? Or does it have some other meaning in view? Is this really a son, or does it mean something else? &#8220;And the government shall be upon his shoulder.&#8221; Does this really mean the government, or does this mean a chair, a house, a scroll, or something else? &#8220;His name shall be called Wonderful.&#8221; Is His name wonderful? &#8220;His name shall be called...Counselor.&#8221; Is He a counselor to you? It says that He is the Mighty God. Do you believe that? And &#8220;the Eternal Father.&#8221; Does that mean what it says or not? It does-if you do not have a blind spot. But if you have a blind spot and begin with a preconceived premise, when you get to this point in the verse, you will twist it, turn it, or do something with it to explain it away because you cannot allow it to say what it actually says. &#8220;His name shall be called...The Eternal Father.&#8221; This means Jesus Christ.<p>At this point I call the reader&#8217;s attention to a little book entitled The Twofoldness of Divine Truth by Robert Govett. He says this: <p>Two hedges define the road; from two abutments springs the bridge. Does the bird fly with one wing? No-with two. Cut off one and it must forever keep to the surface. Thus does God try His people. Will they trust Him when He affirms that view of truth which runs counter to their temperaments and intellectual bias? or will they trample on one of His sayings in their zeal for the other? The humble, child-like saint will acknowledge and receive both; for his Father, who cannot err, testifies to each alike. <p>Again he says, <p>It must not be forgotten or denied that there are continually exhibited within its [the Bible&#8217;s] pages truths seemingly opposed to each other. It is the glory of man&#8217;s intellect to produce oneness. His aim is to trace different results to one principle, to clear it of ambiguities, to show how, through varied appearances, one law holds. Anything that stands in the way of the completeness of this, he eludes or denies, as something destructive of the glory and of the efficiency of his discovery. But it is not so with God.<p>This is exactly what the Melodyland speaker does. This is why we say he has a blind spot. He cannot accept the two, which seem like opposing sides, but are in reality two sides of one thing. He simply has to make everything fit. He has to force it into his theological mold. What he cannot make fit he either does not quote, or else wrenches, in order to make it say what his premise already holds. So he either eludes it or denies it.<p>It is so good to be able to come simply to the Word of God with no premise and derive our premise from within the Word; not to superimpose our premise upon the Word. We love to study the Bible to find out what is in the Bible.<h1 class=msg>CHRISTIAN PRACTICES</h1><h2 class=head1>17. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In a recent meeting at Melodyland in Anaheim, California, a speaker in his attack upon Witness Lee and the local churches referred in a rather mocking way to what he calls the doctrine of releasing the spirit. He mentions that if you were to attend a meeting of the local church, you would find that it would be punctuated with loud exclamations of &#8220;O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah, and Praise the Lord!&#8221; He goes on to say that a newcomer might think that this was strange, but it is the common practice in the meetings of the local church in what is known as &#8220;the doctrine of releasing the spirit.&#8221;<p>Since this speaker has probably never been to a meeting of the local church, I would like to say that his mocking way of describing our meetings is absolutely not true. What is wrong with Christians coming together to praise the Lord and call upon His name? The Bible tells us clearly that we are one spirit with the Lord. &#8220;But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). We also know from Romans 8:16 that the Holy Spirit is with our spirit. &#8220;The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.&#8221; Paul even says that the Lord Jesus Himself is with our spirit. &#8220;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit&#8221; (2 Tim. 4:22). Therefore, we have found in our experience that we need to have our spirit released so that the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit might also be released in our meetings. To us this is not something to be mocked, neither is it a doctrine that we hold. It is simply a practice we enjoy.<p>There are numerous references in the Psalms where the writer cries out, &#8220;O Lord!&#8221; One of these references is Psalm 130:1: &#8220;Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.&#8221; We have found that to call on the name of the Lord is not only scriptural, but also quite effective in contacting the Lord. This is why, as this speaker mockingly mentions, we call, &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; in our meetings as well as in our daily enjoyment of the Lord. Paul tells us clearly in Romans 10:12 that the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. The word &#8220;call&#8221; here as well as in other verses concerning calling on the name of the Lord is the Greek word, epikaleo. This word means to call out, to invoke a person by name. W. E. Vine in his Expository Dictionary of the New Testament says that this word means to call upon by way of adoration, making use of the name of the Lord. J. H. Thayer in his Greek Lexicon of the New Testament says that it means to cry out upon, and to call upon by pronouncing the name.<p>It is quite evident that the early Christians called upon the name of the Lord. The apostle Paul addresses his first Epistle to the Corinthians to &#8220;all that in every place call (epikaleo) upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:2). When Ananias was told by the Lord to go and lay his hands upon Saul of Tarsus that he might receive his sight, he replied, &#8220;Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call (epikaleo) on thy name&#8221; (Acts 9:13-14). It seems from the message that was given at Melodyland that the speaker would like to do the same-to bind all that call on the Lord&#8217;s name.<p>We would like to appeal to all Christians everywhere with a fair conscience. Do we not need to have our spirit released so that the Lord Jesus might be released? We would even ask all Christians with a sincere heart to try calling on the name of the Lord from the depths of their being and see if they are not nourished and strengthened. Just call, &#8220;O Lord, O Lord Jesus!&#8221; I can testify from my experience as a Christian for over thirty years, and as a seminary graduate, that I have never touched and enjoyed the Lord so much as since I began to call upon Him in this way. Truly He is rich to all that call upon Him.<h2 class=head1>18. THE TRUTH CONCERNING PRAY-READING</h2><p>In a blatant and insulting attack on Witness Lee and the local church last week, a speaker at Melodyland used mockery and sarcasm to malign the practice of pray-reading. He called it a blasphemy to God and meaningless repetition. He accused brothers in the Lord of just wanting to have something different. He described it as &#8220;sound and fury signifying nothing.&#8221; He even said that praying with the Word made him nauseous and stated that in practicing pray-reading we &#8220;put our mind out of gear.&#8221;<p>It is beyond me how prayer and reading the Bible can be blasphemous, for pray-reading is simply praying with the Word of God. Is the Word of God meaningless? Christians have repeated His Word for centuries without finding it meaningless.<p>We do not just have a desire to have something different. We only desire more of Christ. Is there something wrong with that?<p>He called pray-reading &#8220;sound and fury signifying nothing.&#8221; This only shows that he knows nothing of what he is talking about. Anyone who has contacted the Lord Jesus in the Word would never say that this signifies nothing. Will he, in eternity, say that the amens and hallelujahs resounding through the vault of heaven are just &#8220;sound and fury signifying nothing&#8221;? (Rev. 19:1, 3-4).<p>As to the matter of putting our mind out of gear, this is utter nonsense. The problem is not a matter of putting the mind out of gear, but of having the mind renewed (Eph. 4:23). The unrenewed mind and the Bible do not mix. In his book The Release of the Spirit Watchman Nee warns of studying the Bible with the mind unrenewed:<p>How often man in his conceit relies on his unrenewed mind to read the Bible. The fruit is nothing but his own thought. He does not touch the Spirit of the Holy Word. If we expect to meet the Lord in His Word, our thoughts must first be broken by God.<p>We intend to meet the Lord in the Word and therefore are willing to have our thoughts broken by God. All the seeking Christians sincerely want to contact the Lord more and more. If we have found a way that is fruitful, why are we accused and condemned for it?<p>All the seeking Christians realize that in order to grow spiritually they must eat spiritual food. In the Old Testament, Jeremiah ate the Word (Jer. 15:16), Ezekiel ate the Word (Ezek. 3:1-3), and David ate the Word (Psa. 119:103). The Lord Jesus spoke of the Word as spiritual food (Matt. 4:4), and Peter said that we should &#8220;desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:2).<p>The vital question to us all is how can we eat the Word of God? For years we were taught and assured that we could eat the Word by study and searching the Scripture. The trouble with that was that although we learned a great deal about the Scripture, we never contacted the life of Christ. The Lord said, &#8220;Ye search the scriptures...and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life&#8221; (John 5:39-40). What did the Lord mean by this? Andrew Murray put it this way:<p>The Word is a seed. In every seed there is a fleshly part in which life is hidden. One may have a most precious and perfect seed in its bodily substance, and yet unless it is exposed in suitable soil to the influence of the sun and moisture, the life may never grow up. And so we may hold the words and doctrines of scripture most intelligently and earnestly, and yet know little of their life and power (The Spirit of Christ, p. 47).<p>My personal experience fully confirms this. The only thing that this kind of study produced was much dryness, just like eating the dry outer shell of the seed. At the end of my second year of seminary, I felt as though I were a bottle of dry dust.<p>Then I discovered pray-reading through Witness Lee&#8217;s ministry in the local church. What nourishment! What satisfaction I found! By pray-reading I had discovered the way into the life of the seed. Instead of being a bottle of dry dust, I now felt like a well of living water was inside me.<p>What is wrong with prayer? The Bible admonishes us to pray without ceasing (1 Thes. 5:17).<p>What is wrong with reading? Paul exhorts us to read (1 Tim. 4:13).<p>What, then, is wrong with putting the two, praying and reading, together? No logical person would contend with it.<p>Many great spiritual Christians in past ages have practiced a kind of pray-reading. That godly man, George Muller, through whom God gave over a million pounds sterling to support his orphanages and more than thirty thousand souls in answer to his prayers, advocated praying the Word of God.<p>Madame Guyon, the French saint of the seventeenth century, wrote a well-known book of that period highly recommending this method.<p>Andrew Murray says in his little book The Prayer Life, &#8220;Little of the Word with little prayer is death to the spiritual life. Much of the word with little prayer gives a sickly life. Much prayer with a little of the Word gives more life, but without steadfastness. A full measure of the Word and prayer gives a healthy and powerful life&#8221; (p. 88). The &#8220;full measure&#8221; of the Word and prayer is amply realized through pray-reading. We experience health and strength in our Christian life. In the past a number of saints have suggested to read the Bible prayerfully.<p>What way does the Bible itself give us to take the Word of God? An accurate translation of Ephesians 6:17-18 says, &#8220;And take...the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&#8221; Paul tells us to take the Word by means of all prayer. This is too clear! Pray the Word of God! This is pray-reading! It is the scriptural way to take the Word. We have chosen to follow the exhortation of the Bible and pray-read the Word of God.<h1 class=msg>THE CULT ACCUSATION</h1><h2 class=head1>19. THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE LOCAL CHURCH NOT BEING A CULT</h2><p>When the main speaker at Melodyland on Sunday, October 2, 1977 began his address on Witness Lee and the local church, his initial remark after prayer was, &#8220;If you have come to the meeting this afternoon anticipating &#8216;Roast Witness Lee and the local church,&#8217; I feel you will be sadly disappointed.&#8221; He went on to say that &#8220;the purpose of our study...is not the principle of attacking individuals; it is the principle of responding when attacks are made upon Christian theology.&#8221;<p>And yet despite these remarks and his prayer that the Holy Spirit would &#8220;sweep away our prejudices and those convictions which are not founded upon Thy Word,&#8221; he immediately went on to attack in a high-handed, degrading manner, rather than staying with the doctrinal points.<p>The method of the speaker&#8217;s attack was to immediately place the local churches and Witness Lee within the kingdom of the cults. The speaker, in his book The Kingdom of the Cults, has described a mentality or &#8220;certain psychological traits&#8221; of a cult member. By associating Witness Lee and the local churches with Joseph Smith and Mormonism, J. F. Rutherford, Charles T. Russell and Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Mary Baker Eddy and Christian Science, and Herbert W. Armstrong and the Radio Church of God, the speaker has condemned us as a cult.<p>While, to my knowledge, the speaker has never called the local churches a cult, he nevertheless resorts to this cheap journalistic device of guilt by association. The speaker knows all too well the principle of guilt by association, so he knows what he is doing in the public&#8217;s mind when he persists in this tactic. If the speaker were absolutely pure in his motives of determining the truth, he would not have to resort to such a tactic.<p>There are many individuals, and even denominations, that differ with the speaker&#8217;s interpretations of Christian theology, but he has not grouped them with such heretical cults as Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, who deny the very divinity of Jesus Christ.<p>Furthermore, the speaker endorsed Jack Sparks&#8217;s book, The Mindbenders, saying, &#8220;It is a must for Christians to read.&#8221; He agreed with the author&#8217;s assessment of the psychology of people in the local churches and said he was grateful to Jack Sparks for &#8220;his psychological insights.&#8221; In that book, Sparks says, &#8220;The brainwashing or mindbending of the local church is, I believe, the most powerful and lasting of any cult on the contemporary scene....Their means to mind control is as frightening as it is effective. It begins with...an involuntary forfeiture of all normal use of the human mind.&#8221;<p>As a blood-washed, born-again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, I am grieved in my spirit and outraged at the vicious, unfounded statements that these two men are making about Christians. These men have made sweeping generalizations about the people in the local churches based upon their research in cults and far-eastern religions. They have not bothered to really find out what kind of people, what kind of Christians, are in the local churches.<p>I attend the same seminary where the speaker teaches, but he has never asked me about my experience in the church in Anaheim. He has taken Witness Lee&#8217;s remarks out of context and left the impression with his audience that all those in the churches are ignorant, mindless people, blindly following this man. I can testify boldly to all Christians, to the speaker, and before the Lord Jesus Christ, that I am not blindly following Witness Lee, nor have I forfeited &#8220;all normal use&#8221; of my mind.<p>But I do have a spirit within me and I know when my experience matches what the Word of God says. I do know and do experience as Romans 8:6 says, &#8220;To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace&#8221; (RSV).<p>In the local churches, we have seen that the Spirit here in Romans 8:6 is our spirit and that as 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him&#8221; (RSV). We are experiencing walking in the spirit.<p>I have studied at Melodyland School of Theology and completed the Master of Divinity program. I am now completing my thesis as the final requirement. During this time I have excelled in my studies, being placed on the dean&#8217;s list, while I was in the local church.<p>This appears inconsistent with what the speaker and the author of The Mindbenders have said about people in the local churches.<p>While I do not expect the speaker to necessarily understand or agree with what the Lord Jesus Christ is doing in the local churches, I do hope that he would refrain from this vile association of Witness Lee and the local churches with the cults. Let him continue his research, let him continue to discuss doctrinal points, but the spirit of Christian love demands that he repent of his biting sarcasm and degrading remarks about the local churches.<h1 class=msg>A PERSONAL ATTACK</h1><h2 class=head1>20. A TESTIMONY CONCERNING WITNESS LEE</h2><p>For the past eight years, I have been closely associated with the work, ministry, and person of Witness Lee. I can testify from intimate personal experience that I have seen hundreds of people genuinely born again, delivered from sin and the world, and presently following the Lord Jesus Christ with their whole heart as a result of his ministry.<p>I have visited all the local churches in this country and also in Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. These churches are the fruit of the fundamental, Bible-oriented, Christ-exalting ministry of Witness Lee.<p>It grieved me to hear the speaker at Melodyland attack, mock, despise, and ridicule Witness Lee and yet claim to be speaking in the spirit of Christian love. To me this is clearly a case of character assassination of the lowest sort. I am grieved because I know that Witness Lee is a blood-washed, born-again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ who has been greatly used by God for more than forty years.<p>The speaker strongly accused Witness Lee of not keeping his word concerning a taped conversation between himself and Witness Lee. According to documented evidence in our possession, we declare this to be absolutely unfair and dishonest, and charge the speaker himself with not keeping his word and the agreement he made with Witness Lee.<p>As to Witness Lee&#8217;s keeping his word, I can testify that I have been to his home many times and can say concerning his daily life that it is according to the Scriptures. I know him to be a person who absolutely keeps the Word of God and lives a life that exemplifies the highest Christian character. I have known personally many of the well-known Christian speakers in this country and have never met a man that compares even slightly to Witness Lee in character, daily living, or humanity.<p>In my opinion, he has been severely mocked and made to look foolish. The speaker used sarcastic and caustic remarks about his education and his knowledge of the Scriptures. The speaker insults Witness Lee by saying, &#8220;He is venerated as an authority, yet the man has no theological training to justify it whatsoever. He uses Greek terms in his writings and he can&#8217;t read the Greek alphabet.&#8221; This kind of comment reminds me of the words of the Jews concerning the Lord Jesus: &#8220;How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?&#8221; (John 7:15) and &#8220;Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed&#8221; (John 7:48-49).<p>It is a shame that Christians should blatantly attack one another without thorough research on the man and the content of his ministry.<p>The speaker also maligns Witness Lee as a self-styled recovery agent, implying that we, the people in the local church are just following Witness Lee and not submitting our lives to the Holy Spirit. This comment is very insulting and false. I can testify that no other man that I have ever known turns so many people to the Lord to love Him and follow Him. How wonderful Christ is to us in the local church! He is renewing and transforming us to be conformed to the image of His Son. Never have I been so helped in knowing the Word of God, loving the Lord Jesus Christ, and being led by the Holy Spirit as since coming to know and be with Witness Lee.<h1 class=msg>APPENDIX</h1><p>The following is the list of articles printed in The Orange County Register from October 8, 1977 through March 4, 1978, in response to the Bible Answer Man.<p>October 8, 1977</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Response of Witness Lee & Local Churches to a Recent Meeting Held at Melodyland</li><li>Controversial Broadcast Exposed concerning Witness Lee</li></ul><p>October 15</p><ul class="disc"><li>A Further Response by Witness Lee & Local Churches to a Recent Meeting Held at Melodyland</li></ul><p>October 22</p><ul class="disc"><li>Witness Lee & Local Churches Reply to the &#8220;Bible Answer Man&#8221;	<ol class="decimal">	<li>Concerning Theological Training</li>	<li>Concerning Translation of the Bible</li>	<li>Concerning Bible Interpretation</li>	<li>Concerning the Scriptural Meaning of the Triune God</li>	<li>Concerning &#8220;Divisions,&#8221; &#8220;Proselytizing,&#8221; and &#8220;Sheep Stealing&#8221;</li>	</ol></li></ul><p>October 29</p><ul class="disc"><li>A Response to False Teachings	<ol class="decimal">	<li>Christ Is Not in the Believer-What a False Teaching!</li>	<li>The Believer Does Not Have the Divine Nature-What a False Teaching!</li>	</ol></li><li>Our Testimony-A Glorious Enjoyment of Christ</li></ul><p>November 5</p><ul class="disc"><li>Testimonies from the Churches</li>	<ol class="decimal">	<li>Misquoting and Misrepresentation</li>	<li>Concerning Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism</li>	<li>Should a Believer Remain in Roman Catholicism?</li>	<li>The Truth concerning the Mingling</li>	<li>The Truth concerning the Experience of Christ</li>	</ol></li></ul><p>December 3</p><ul class="disc"><li>Are Soul and Spirit the Same?</li></ul><p>December 10</p><ul class="disc"><li>A Challenge to the Bible Answer Man	<ol class="decimal">	<li>A Review of the Controversy</li>	<li>A Theologian&#8217;s Judgment</li>	<li>A Third Party&#8216;s Voice</li>	</ol></li></ul><p>December 24</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Bible Answer Man Says: The Believer Does Not Have the Divine Nature</li><li>The Educational Myth of the Bible Answer Man</li></ul><p>December 31</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Bible Answer Man Says: Christ is Represented in the Believer</li></ul><p>January 7, 1978</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Bible Answer Man Has Three Gods</li></ul><p>January 14</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Bible Answer Man Says: Catholicism Does Not Teach Idolatry</li></ul><p>January 21</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Bible Answer Man Says: &#8220;Back Again to Historic Christianity&#8221;</li></ul><p>January 28</p><ul class="disc"><li>What Does Christ Think of the Historic Church?</li></ul><p>February 4</p><ul class="disc"><li>What is God&#8217;s Recovery?</li></ul><p>February 11</p><ul class="disc"><li>False Teachings Exposed	<ol class="decimal">	<li>On Division</li>	<li>On God</li>	<li>On the Spirit</li>	</ol></li></ul><p>February 18</p><ul class="disc"><li>More False Teachings Exposed	<ol class="decimal">	<li>On the Body</li>	<li>On Practical Oneness</li>	<li>On the Bible</li>	<li>On the Flesh</li>	<li>On the Church as the Manifestation of God</li>	</ol></li></ul><p>February 25</p><ul class="disc"><li>A Cheerful Defense concerning the Triune God	<ol class="decimal">	<li>Biblical Terminology and the Language of Experience</li>	<li>The Historical Revelation of the Triune God</li>	<li>The Relationship within the Triune God</li>	</ol></li></ul><p>March 4</p><ul class="disc"><li>The Oneness of the Triune God	<ol class="decimal">	<li>The Interpenetration Scriptures</li>	<li>The Identification Scriptures</li>	<li>The Interchangeable Scriptures</li>	</ol></li></ul></body></html>
