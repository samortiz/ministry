The Main Items of the Building<br>and Their Significances in Typology</H2><P>The main items of the building also have their significances in typology.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Temple</H2><P>The temple replaced the tabernacle as God's dwelling on earth (6:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Signifying the Incarnated Christ<br>as God's Dwelling on the Earth</H2><P>The temple first signifies the incarnated Christ as God's dwelling on the earth (John 2:19-21; 1:14; Matt. 12:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Signifying the Church</H2><P>The temple also signifies the church, including all the believers, the members of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ to be God's dwelling on the earth (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; Eph. 2:21-22). The temple signifies both Christ and the church because the church and Christ are one. Christ is the Head and the church is the Body. The Body is the enlargement of the Head for God's dwelling. Hence, for God to dwell in Christ is for God to dwell in the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Its Size</H2><P>The size of the temple was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high (1 Kings 6:2). We should compare this with the size of the tabernacle&#151;thirty cubits long, ten cubits wide, and ten cubits high (Exo. 26:16-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Its Windows for Air and Light</H2><P>The windows of the temple were for air and light, signifying the life-giving Spirit's fellowship bringing the spiritual air and the divine light (1 Kings 6:4a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Its Fixed Lattices</H2><P>Its fixed lattices were for keeping the windows open and the negative things away (v. 4b). This signifies the fellowship of the life-giving Spirit keeping the opening for the divine communication and protecting the room from the invasion of all negative matters and things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Front Portico</H2><P>The front portico of the temple, a space to receive people (v. 3), signifies the opening, the accepting, and the receiving of the temple to the people (like the lobby of a magnificent building).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Outer Temple, the Holy Place</H2><P>The outer temple, the Holy Place, signifies the soul of the believers as God's temple sanctified unto God (v. 5a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Innermost Sanctuary, the Holy of Holies</H2><P>The innermost sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, signifies the spirit of the believers as God's temple, the same in its three dimensions, as is the New Jerusalem, the largest form of the Holy of Holies (vv. 5b, 16, 20; Rev. 21:16).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Kings &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
