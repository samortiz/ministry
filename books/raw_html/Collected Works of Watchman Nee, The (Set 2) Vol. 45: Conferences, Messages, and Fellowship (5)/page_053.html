<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TODAY</h2><p>What Christians need today is a revelation from God. They need to see God's accomplished work rather than asking Him to do some new work. For Paul the battle was in the proclamation of God's eternal plan. For the saints the battle lies in seeing this plan. For Paul this was a matter of speaking the eternal plan. For the saints it is a matter of seeing the eternal plan. Paul prayed for this; He asked the Father to give to the saints in Ephesus a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that they would see that God has accomplished everything. This is the special character of the book of Ephesians. Everything is accomplished, whether it is the work before the foundation of the world or the work on the cross.</p><p>Suppose a brother wants to deal with his temper. He tries once, twice, even many times, but without success. He repeatedly fails, and eventually he blames God in his heart for not working on him or dealing with his temper. However, the real problem lies in this person's heart&mdash;he only hopes that God will do something. He thinks that his problems would be solved and he would overcome if only God would do something. But verse 3 says that God has already given us every spiritual blessing in Christ. We must see this in order to receive this revelation. We have to ask ourselves why we cannot believe that God has accomplished everything. We do not need to ask for greater power from God to overcome our temper. We only need to ask the Lord to show us the facts that Christ accomplished on the cross. All we have to do is to claim them by faith. The Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross. Three days later He resurrected. Resurrection is the pinnacle of God's work; He need not advance any further than resurrection. We need not ask God to do anything for us; the only thing we need is revelation.</p><p>Revelation reveals God's accomplished facts. It connects us to the past. Revelation is not necessarily something related to the future. Many people hope that they will overcome in the future, but God wants us to see what has already been accomplished on the cross. Once we see this, we will release our praise! The power that God operates in us who believe is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. This is too wonderful! This power operates in us just as it operated in Christ when God raised Him from the dead! This power enables life to enter into death and come out again. Today we do not need to seek or pray for greater power. We have to see that Christ has already attained everything; He has obtained the power that transcends everything. Our power does not lie in what God is going to do, but in seeing what He has already done. Revelation is the key to everything.</p><p>Our regeneration is based on seeing God's accomplished redemption on the cross of Christ. In reading Ephesians we realize that man's unique need is revelation. We must see that the power in the believers is a power that subdues Hades and that prevails over death and the devil. A Christian becomes weak because he does not have revelation. Whether or not a Christian is victorious depends on whether he sees and has revelation; it has nothing to do with how much power he has. Those who have revelation spontaneously have power. Those who do not have revelation will fail no matter how hard they struggle.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER AND REVELATION</h2><p>Paul prayed that the believers would have revelation and that they would see. Prayer brings in revelation. It shows us that we are saved, that we are liberated, that life has entered into death, and that new life has come out of death. This resurrection life enables us to experience all that Christ has gone through and consummates in the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!</p>
