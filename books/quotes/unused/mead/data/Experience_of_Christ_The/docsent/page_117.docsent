   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET OF ENJOYING THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we have seen five secrets: the first is that to do all things we need to be in Him; the second, that to be in Him we need to abide in Him; the third, that to abide in Him we need to take care of the anointing; the fourth, that to take care of the anointing we need to remain on the cross; and the fifth, that in order to stay on the cross we must depend upon the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have seen these five secrets, we must still consider a sixth the secret of how to enjoy the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Thessalonians 5:16 through 18 say, "Rejoice evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead of periods after verses 16 and 17, there should be commas.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This change of punctuation indicates that rejoicing evermore, praying without ceasing, and giving thanks in everything are the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has a will regarding us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will is that we must constantly rejoice, pray, and give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the sixth and last secret, the practical secret.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without it, all the other secrets mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we are so forgetful, we need to practice remembering all these secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, let us go over them again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first secret is that if we would be able to do all things, we need to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second secret is that to be in Him requires that we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third secret is that to abide in Him we need to take care of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fourth secret is that in order to take care of the inner anointing we must remain on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen that we in ourselves are not able to stay on the cross; instead, we often come down from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we need to know the fifth secret: remaining on the cross by means of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But all this is of no avail without the sixth secret, the secret of how to enjoy the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This secret is to rejoice always, to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose as I am ministering, a brother stands up and says, "Brother Lee, I don't agree with your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must stop."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At such a time I need to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To fail to rejoice is to get off the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, if a brother rebukes me and tells me to stop speaking, I should say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How happy I am!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sisters should also do this when their husbands give them a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sisters, instead of being troubled by your husbands, rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we are not rejoicing, we come down from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The indwelling Spirit works with us in our rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For years I have encouraged the saints to release the spirit and to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I wish to point out that the best way to release the spirit is to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To rejoice is not merely to be happy; it is to make a joyful noise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are joyful, we rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1 Thessalonians 5 the word "rejoice" is modified by the word "evermore," and the word "pray" by the words "without ceasing."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, in everything we are to give thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that even if a sister's husband gives her a difficult time, she should praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These three things, which have been ordained by God, are like small screws in a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But without these screws, the entire machine cannot operate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we fail to give thanks in something, the indwelling Spirit is choked.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 Thessalonians 5 the matter of not quenching the Spirit is related to rejoicing evermore, to praying without ceasing, and to giving thanks in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you do not rejoice, you quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do not pray or give thanks, you also quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to stir up the Spirit is to rejoice always, to pray unceasingly, and to give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit here is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we have this Spirit within us, the Spirit is often choked because we do not rejoice, pray, or give thanks.</S>
