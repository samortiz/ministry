   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TOP ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE ENJOYMENT OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE CORPORATE CHRIST, THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians may feel that the Sunday morning service is too poor and that because of this it is more profitable to stay home and study a good reference Bible with concordances, word studies, and notes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not bad; it is better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, whoever does this will not receive as much enjoyment of the Lord as he could receive in a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regardless of how much we enjoy Jesus in our personal study of the Bible, we still cannot enjoy the corporate Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to enjoy the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, we need to come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be in the Body in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be given to drink is to be positioned to drink, which, according to the whole verse, is to be put into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we stay away from the meetings yet still try to pray-read, call on the Lord, and even shout, we will have a certain amount of enjoyment, but this enjoyment will be restricted and limited.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to make a fire with only one piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is better to have many pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then one piece will burn another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When one person says, O Lord, another says, Hallelujah, and a third person says, Amen, we burn one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We strengthen, minister to, and supply one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way we enjoy not only the Head but the Head with the Body, and not only the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, verse 12 tells us that just as the body has many members but is one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then verse 13 begins with the word for, indicating that it is a continuation, definition, and explanation of the foregoing verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the members are one Body, and this Body is Christ, because in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we pointed out before, without our spirit our body would be a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the spirit leaves the body, the body decomposes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, with our spirit still in our body, the many members of our body are living and are one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is our spirit that keeps all the members joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, we as the many members of the Body of Christ are one because we have been baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, the one Spirit in whom we have been baptized is Christ, who became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the Body is Christ, and Christ is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have all been positioned in the Body to drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again, this one Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have been put into Christ, the life-giving Spirit, and we have been positioned in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, since we are in the Body, we need to drink this one Spirit, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually we are filled, flooded, saturated, and permeated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we are one with one another and with Christ as one Body, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we enjoy Christ, we enjoy the Body, including all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For more than forty years I have been continually enjoying the Body-Christ in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without the Body, I could try to declare that Christ is rich, but eventually I would no longer be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I am with the Body, however, the more I speak, the more I have something to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because the more my speaking supplies the Body, the more I am supplied by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While I am ministering to the Body, the Body is ministering to me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the saints were to listen to my speaking without responding, the supply of the Body would be cut off from me, and I would not be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without the supply of the Body, I have nothing with which to supply the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, if while I am speaking, all the members are responding, the Body is ministering to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then there is a current, a circulation, in the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today we are enjoying the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many good teachers have pointed out that in 1 Corinthians Christ is power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, the deep things of God, the foundation, our Passover, our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock, and the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, most teachers would not tell us that Christ is the life-giving Spirit or that He is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are enjoying Christ all the way from the power and wisdom of God to the firstfruits, the second man, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit, and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, the issue of the enjoyment of all the items of Christ is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Body-Christ comes out of the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To enjoy Christ as the power of God is wonderful, but it cannot compare with the enjoyment of Christ as the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To enjoy Christ as power is to enjoy Him in one aspect, but to enjoy Him as the Body-Christ is to enjoy Him in fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our enjoyment of the Body-Christ is the reason we sing, We come together there s nothing better Hymns, #1196 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Coming together as the Body-Christ is better than waiting for a heaven that is far away and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the church we come together here and now.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is nothing better than this, because nowhere else can we enjoy the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we stay at home, we may be able to enjoy Christ as our power, wisdom, or other items, but in order to enjoy the Body-Christ, we must be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may miss many other things, but we should not miss one meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is in the church that we are in the position to drink the Body-Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no other place to drink the Body-Christ but in the coming together of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even in the meetings of the local churches we do not enjoy Christ as much as we do in the conferences of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the conference meetings we enjoy an even greater Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, it is worthwhile to pay the price to come to the conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot obtain such an enjoyment anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hallelujah, in the church we enjoy the Body-Christ!</S>
