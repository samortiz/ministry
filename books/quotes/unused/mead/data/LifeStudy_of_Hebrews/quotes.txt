[1]  In our Life-study of Hebrews, we shall be concerned with the profound concepts of this book and with its heavenly inheritance.
[2]  The Hebrews to whom this book was written believed in the Lord, but they still wanted to hold on to their Jewish religion.
[3]  THE CONTENTS A. The Heavenly Christ, the Present Christ,
[4]  This book, with the concept of all positive things being heavenly, points us to the very Christ who is in the heavens.
[5]  In Timothy and Titus is the Christ who is God s economy for us to behave ourselves in the house of God.
[6]  The divine speaking is the opening point of this book.
[7]  God speaks in two stages: to the fathers and to us.
[8]  Of old, He spoke to the fathers; in these last days, He speaks to us.
[9]  Before God spoke to men, He spoke to nothing.
[10]  But this mystery has been revealed by God s speaking.
[11]  Hebrews chapter one reveals two main things concerning the Son His person and His work.
[12]  The writer of the letter to the Hebrews, being absolutely in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, had the wisdom to say that the Son is the effulgence of God s glory 1:3 .
[13]  The effulgence of God s glory is like the shining or brightness of the rays of the sun.
[14]  The first question they asked was, Mr. Lee, how can you say that Christ is God? I replied, How can you say that Christ is not God? You answer me first and then I ll answer you.
[15]  Verse 8 says concerning the Son, Your throne, O God.
[16]  It compares God s economy in Christ with the Old Testament things.
[17]  A good number of the Hebrew believers, to whom this book was written, appreciated faith in Christ and the salvation in Christ, but they also appreciated their old religious background, which was established by God according to the Old Testament.
[18]  It was not an invention of human imagination; it was established according to God s oracles.
[19]  The Son has a more excellent name than the angels.
[20]  Verse 1:4 says, Having become, by so much, better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
[21]  Romans 1:4 says that Christ was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[22]  Verse 5 indicates His resurrection by which He was begotten to be the Firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 as a beginning of a new age, the age of the church which is composed of His many brothers born of God through His resurrection.
[23]  This is His ascension in which He was inaugurated into His office to carry out God s eternal purpose, that is, to build up the church and to bring His many brothers into glory.
[24]  10, 2 ; He is the Upholder of all things v. 3 ; He is the Heir of all things v. 2 ; He was incarnated for redemption by crucifixion v. 3 ; He was begotten as the Son of God in resurrection for imparting life to the many sons of God v. 5 ; He is the Firstborn Son of God who will come again v. 6 ; He will be the King on the throne with the scepter in the kingdom vv.
[25]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIVE HEIRS OF SALVATION
[26]  In the New Testament there is only one other book in the same category as Hebrews the book of Revelation.
[27]  But I have never heard people talk about it in the way of Christ being revealed so particularly in God s administration, or in the way of the local churches being the testimony of Jesus.
[28]  John 3:16, a verse familiar to every Christian, says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.
[29]  Early in the morning of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to Mary, Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father and My God and your God John 20:17 .
[30]  Here the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that He Himself, as the Son of Man who was born in His resurrection to be God s Firstborn Son, is the heavenly ladder and that upon Him the ministering angels are ascending and descending as they render their service to the house of God composed of God s many sons.
[31]  Wherever the house of God is, there is the heavenly ladder, which is Christ.
[32]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIX SO GREAT A SALVATION
[33]  Many people have preached on this subject about going to heaven.
[34]  The writer of Hebrews used the term so great.
[35]  This is the reason that I say that the so great a salvation is great in what Christ is as the Son of God, as God.
[36]  Then after 2:3, in order to show us that the salvation we have in Christ is great, this book continues by showing us how He is also the Son of Man, a real man.
[37]  The salvation we have in Christ is not merely some matters, such as forgiveness of sins, justification, reconciliation, redemption, regeneration, etc., but also a wonderful, unlimited Person who is both God in eternity and man in time.
[38]  Although I was saved for years, I was not clear that my Savior was both God and man.
[39]  While Christ is fighting as our Captain, He is also ministering as our High Priest.
[40]  This so great a salvation is so great in its extent that it even makes us partners of God s appointed Heir 1:2, 9 .
[41]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SEVEN JESUS AS THE SON OF MAN
[42]  Now we come to the second part of this comparison that Jesus as the Son of Man, as man, is superior to the angels.
[43]  Firstly we saw Christ as the Son of God, as God; now we must see Jesus as the Son of Man, as man.
[44]  When the Pharisees heard that the Lord Jesus called Himself the Son of God, they accused Him of blasphemy because, in their understanding, He made Himself equal with God.
[45]  If you know the Bible as a whole, you will realize that the coming inhabited earth will be this earth in the coming age with God s kingdom.
[46]  Psalm 2:8 says that God has given to Christ the nations to be His inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession.
[47]  Revelation 11:15 says, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
[48]  As the stone for God s building, He is the foundation stone, cornerstone, topstone, and living stone to produce us as stones for God s building 1 Pet 2:5 .
[49]  B. For Christ to Take Possession of the Earth
[50]  The coming inhabited earth in the coming age of the kingdom will be for Christ s possession.
[51]  God s purpose is to recover the earth from the usurping hand of Satan and to establish His kingdom on the earth for the expression of His glory.
[52]  When we, the saved ones, as His partners shall share in His inheritance of the coming inhabited earth, we shall have a share in such a glorious earth with God s kingdom established on it for the expression of God s glory.
[53]  Although the situation at the end of the book of Genesis was very pitiful, it is most promising by the time we come to Psalm 8.
[54]  The psalmist surely was inspired when he said, When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? vv.
[55]  Under the inspiration of God, the psalmist prophesied the recovery of what had been lost in Adam.
[56]  After He accomplished redemption by suffering death, Jesus was glorified in His resurrection Luke 24:26 and in His ascension to the heavens was crowned with glory and honor 2:9 .
[57]  Although the Lord Jesus is both the Son of God and Son of Man, when we come to the matter of His being crowned with glory and honor, we must pay special attention to His humanity, to His being the Son of Man.
[58]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE EIGHT JESUS IN INCARNATION, CRUCIFIXION,
[59]  From my youth, I heard from the pastors that Christ was incarnated simply because God loved us and sent His Son to this evil earth to die for our sins on the cross that we might be saved from hell.
[60]  IN CRUCIFIXION A. Tasting Death on Behalf of Everything
[61]  Although, as a youth, I was told again and again that Christ died on the cross for our sins, I was never told that He tasted death on behalf of everything 2:9 .
[62]  Christ tasted death not only for human beings but for everything, every creature.
[63]  If Christ did not taste death for everything, how could God have reconciled everything to Himself?
[64]  His death released the divine life from within Him and His resurrection imparted the life of God into us in order that we might become the many sons of God and His many brothers.
[65]  As the Captain of our salvation, Christ, in His ascension, has entered into the glory in which God is.
[66]  God s desire is to bring His many sons into glory 2:10 .
[67]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE NINE THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION 1
[68]  It seems that, logically speaking, for salvation we need Jesus to be our Savior and Redeemer, not our Captain, Pioneer, or Forerunner.
[69]  Nevertheless, in God s wonderful salvation, in His so great a salvation, we do need such a Captain.
[70]  Our God has established a great corporation, a great business.
[71]  The purpose of this corporation is to accomplish one thing: to lead many sons into glory 2:10 .
[72]  We need to devote another message to the Captain of salvation.
[73]  Although we spoke about glory in the previous message, because many of us are not clear about the true meaning of glory in the Bible, I am burdened to say something basic regarding glory in this message.
[74]  Although God created man with such an intention and purpose, man has been ruined and corrupted.
[75]  In a sense, ruined mankind has become Chaldea, Babylon, the land of idolatry.
[76]  Abraham s crossing the river and entering into the new land signified his entering into an uplifted, new mankind which is to be used by God to be His expression.
[77]  For this, we not only have the clear type of Abraham and his descendants consummating in the building of the temple, but we have a typical example the Lord Jesus.
[78]  The Lord as the Pioneer and Forerunner is the example, the model, of a person who has crossed the river and entered into God s glory.
[79]  Paul knew that sufferings help to bring us into glory and so he could say, For which cause we faint not; but though our outer man is consumed, yet the inner man is being renewed day by day.
[80]  For the present lightness of the affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 2 Cor 4:16-17, Gk.
[81]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE SANCTIFIER AND THE SANCTIFIED
[82]  In this message we come to the matter of sanctification.
[83]  No book talks as much about sanctification as does the book of Hebrews.
[84]  It is absolutely essential that we have holiness, for without it we cannot live in the presence of God.
[85]  I. THE SANCTIFIER A. The Son of God Incarnated
[86]  In His original state and before His incarnation, the Son of God could not sanctify us.
[87]  Although He might have been able to sanctify you according to your concept of sanctification, He would have been unable to sanctify you according to God s economy.
[88]  Although we were a people who had problems with God, now, through His propitiation, we have no problems with Him.
[89]  He is qualified to be the Sanctifier because He is the Firstborn Son of God, and we are qualified to be the sanctified because we are the many sons of God.
[90]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWELVE THE MANY SONS, THE MANY BROTHERS,
[91]  In the book of Hebrews all of the basic factors of the New Testament are implied in a deeper and yet very simple way.
[92]  The many sons of God of whom the church is composed have all been predestinated unto sonship Eph 1:5 .
[93]  Even at times when we are weak or are backsliding, we still have the deep conviction that we are the children of God because once we have been born of God we shall be His children forever.
[94]  As the many sons of God, we are the many brothers of Christ who is the Firstborn Son of God.
[95]  He was born to be the Firstborn Son of God through His resurrection Acts 13:33 , and we have been produced to be His many brothers in His resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .
[96]  It was after His resurrection that He called His disciples His brothers John 20:17 .
[97]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTEEN A MERCIFUL AND FAITHFUL HIGH PRIEST
[98]  The book of Hebrews is marvelous in both its content and its composition.
[99]  No human mind could have written such an Epistle.
[100]  In order for us to know His qualifications for being such a priest, we need to look back at chapters one and two to see all the items of what He is and of what He has done.
[101]  The answer is that in the first two chapters of this book the writer has mainly covered two points that Christ is the Son of God, God Himself, and the Son of Man, man Himself.
[102]  The Lord Jesus is qualified to be the High Priest because He was tried 2:18 .
[103]  If you read the Gospels again, you will see that no other person has been subject to so many troubles, attacks, misunderstandings, and rumors as the Lord Jesus.
[104]  Eventually Christ was perfected and qualified to be the Captain of our salvation 2:10 .
[105]  All Christians think that a priest is one who serves God, but not many Christians know that, ultimately, a priest is one who ministers God to man.
[106]  The bread and the wine signify God as our enjoyment, God being ministered to us to refresh, sustain, support, strengthen, and nourish us that we may grow with all the riches of God.
[107]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FOURTEEN HOLY BROTHERS AND PARTAKERS
[108]  We have to preach the gospel in a much higher way, telling people that God is calling them to believe in His Firstborn Son that they might become His brothers, even His partners in fulfilling God s eternal plan.
[109]  The holy brothers are the heirs of salvation 1:14 who inherit so great a salvation 2:3 that does not only make us holy brothers to participate in God s holiness, but also brings us into God s glory.
[110]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTEEN CHRIST AS THE APOSTLE SUPERIOR TO MOSES
[111]  In this message we come to the third comparison found in the book of Hebrews that Christ as the Apostle is superior to Moses.
[112]  Then, in chapters one and two, we saw two aspects of the comparison between Christ and the angels.
[113]  As we shall see in another message, the fourth comparison, that between Christ and Aaron, shows us that Christ as the High Priest is superior to Aaron.
[114]  Christ is not only a part of the house but also the Builder of the house vv.
[115]  The Lord Jesus has two natures, the humanity which is good for the material for the building of God s habitation and the divinity which is the element of the builder.
[116]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTEEN PARTNERS OF CHRIST
[117]  In this message we come to the partners of Christ, to the corporate partnership.
[118]  The church is simply the expression of God Himself in Christ.
[119]  Christ was appointed in eternity past and anointed in time 1:9 .
[120]  God has initially inaugurated His appointed Heir into His office by anointing Him.
[121]  THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION A. He, as the Forerunner, the Pioneer,
[122]  He is now sitting at the right hand of God 1:3, 13 crowned with glory and honor 2:9 to be the qualified Captain of our salvation that He may bring us through the pathway of the cross into the good land of rest and glory.
[123]  Likewise, in the first chapter of Hebrews we are told that God has spoken, that God has spoken in the Son, and that, eventually, the Son is addressed, O God.
[124]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE GOOD LAND FOR THE FULFILLMENT
[125]  I feel strongly that we need to have a message on the good land for the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[126]  Man came from the resurrected land, the resurrected earth, and lived on this earth to express God and to represent Him, to form an expression of God and a kingdom of God.
[127]  This is God s eternal purpose: to express Himself in a practical and real way through a corporate entity composed of many human beings.
[128]  Genesis 1:26 says that man was made in the image of God, and Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.
[129]  When his descendants fell away from that good land, God brought them out of their fallen place and restored them to the good land.
[130]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 1
[131]  In this message we come to the Sabbath rest 4:9 .
[132]  When man was damaged by the fall, this rest was lost.
[133]  In the church age, He, as the heavenly Christ, the One who has expressed, represented, and satisfied God and who rests from His work and sits on the right hand of God in the heavens, is the rest to us in our spirit Matt 11:28-29 .
[134]  When God rested on the seventh day, Adam also rested.
[135]  Likewise, when God has no rest, man has no rest either.
[136]  In John chapter four, the Lord Jesus was laboring because He was hungry.
[137]  No, there was no rest because man had not yet been gained by God for His expression and representation.
[138]  If in the church life today all the brothers and the sisters go their own way and no one goes God s way, there will be no rest, even if we come together in a very active way.
[139]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 2
[140]  In the last message we saw the real meaning of the Sabbath rest, seeing that it is not merely a rest after the completion of work but that it means satisfaction.
[141]  If your desire has not been satisfied, you cannot have rest.
[142]  The best rest, the real rest, is the satisfaction of our heart s desire.
[143]  From the beginning of the Bible to the end, we can see that God s desire according to His eternal plan is to have Himself expressed and represented by man.
[144]  When we are satisfied in our God s desire, we are resting even as we are laboring and working.
[145]  Firstly, God had Adam and then, gradually, He had Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham with his descendants, and then the children of Israel.
[146]  When the Lord Jesus was baptized, God was happy and satisfied, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased Matt 3:17 .
[147]  Not only did God rest in Him, but so many of those who followed Him also rested in the Lord Jesus.
[148]  If the Lord Jesus in the flesh was God s Sabbath, then the church, the Body of Christ, must be an even greater Sabbath to God.
[149]  At this point we need to read Hebrews 3:6-7: But Christ, as a Son over His house, Whose house we are, if we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end. Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear His voice.
[150]  If we would enjoy Christ, we need to be in the house and be a part of the house.
[151]  The use of the word wherefore to connect verses 6 and 7 means that we must take care of the house of God or else we shall miss the Sabbath and not enter into rest.
[152]  If we did not have this word here, we would be unable to see that the Sabbath rest today is the house of God under the care of the Son of God.
[153]  Many of us can testify that for years where we were before we came into the church life we did not have the realization that the Son of God was declaring the Father to us or singing praises to the Father in our midst.
[154]  After mentioning these two matters in chapters two and three, the writer of Hebrews speaks of the remaining Sabbath rest in chapter four, telling us that we need to be diligent to enter into that rest v. 11 . What is the Sabbath, the good land, mentioned here? It is the church life, the house of God, the church in which the Son of God praises the Father, and the house of God taken care of by the Son of God.
[155]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 3
[156]  We thank the Lord for what He has been showing us about the Sabbath rest.
[157]  God could never find His full rest in heaven, because heaven is not the place where His eternal purpose is fulfilled.
[158]  Regardless of how wonderful or excellent the angels may be, God s rest is not with the angels in heaven but with man on the earth.
[159]  Eventually, the Bible reveals that God s full rest, His full Sabbath, will be on the earth with a living composition of all the redeemed people.
[160]  In Genesis 2 we see that God s first Sabbath was immediately after He had gained a man on earth in His image to express Him and with His authority to represent Him.
[161]  The temple in the good land filled with God s glory signified that God had secured on earth a people to be His dwelling place, a place where He could dwell, express Himself and exercise His dominion.
[162]  When we come to the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, we see that the glory of God filled the temple once again, and God again secured a habitation with man on earth for His rest.
[163]  God has sown Himself into a part of mankind which became the church and which includes everyone who has received the Lord Jesus.
[164]  In the last three messages we have seen the meaning of the Sabbath rest according to the full revelation of the Holy Word.
[165]  In brief, the Sabbath rest is simply God s satisfaction in His heart s desire.
[166]  Whenever and wherever God is expressed and represented by man on earth, He is satisfied and at rest.
[167]  After the Lord Jesus came to declare God, expressing and representing Him as an example and model, the church was produced by His death and resurrection and became the corporate expression and representation of God.
[168]  In this stage, God s major task is to sow Himself into mankind and to make this part of mankind the church, the Body of Christ, the house of God.
[169]  In the New Testament we are clearly told that the church as the expression and representation of God is the kingdom of God on earth today Rom 14:17 .
[170]  We are now in the church life, the growing Sabbath that is leading us into the harvest Sabbath of the millennial kingdom.
[171]  At this point we need to consider the two major schools of doctrine the Calvinist school and the Arminian school.
[172]  The Calvinist school says that everything is a matter of God s grace, selection, and predestination.
[173]  According to this school, once God has selected and predestinated us and we have been saved, there are no problems; once we have been saved, our salvation is secure for eternity.
[174]  If we are to understand any major aspect of this revelation, we must take care of the governing principles established and revealed in the Bible.
[175]  The governing principle of the Bible as a whole is that God in eternity past made a purpose, a plan, which was to express Himself with His authority.
[176]  This plan, God s eternal purpose, is thoroughly revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation.
[177]  In Genesis 1 and 2 we see that man is the center of God s created universe.
[178]  Let us now see how God accomplishes His purpose.
[179]  In his natural make-up, man is not the genuine fulfillment of God s purpose, but only a photograph, a prefigure.
[180]  In this corporate man we can see much more than we can with Adam, for Adam was only a single man as a photograph of God s satisfaction, while Abraham, including his descendants, was a complete, corporate figure of God s satisfaction.
[181]  At this point we need to consider the Lord s chastisement.
[182]  First Corinthians 11:32 says, When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
[183]  Matthew 1 tells us that Jesus is the Savior and Emmanuel; Matthew 6 tells us to pray, Thy kingdom come ; Matthew 11 tells us that we may come to the Lord for rest; Matthew 12 reveals that Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath; Matthew 16 unveils that the church is built upon Christ and that the kingdom is ushered in through the built-up church; Matthew 18 tells us that we should be in the proper church life; and Matthew 16:27 warns us that the Lord will return to reward us.
[184]  As God s crop we need to reach ripeness, maturity Rev 14:15 .
[185]  If we are wrong, we need to be chastised; if we are immature, we need to be left in the field to ripen.
[186]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 6 XXIV.
[187]  First Peter 4:17 says, For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
[188]  In this verse we can see that there are different governmental dealings of God.
[189]  God deals with His house, that is, His children, in one way and at one time, and He deals with those who do not obey the gospel in another way and at another time.
[190]  On the contrary, this verse says that God s judgment will begin at His house.
[191]  We have not only been regenerated that we may have the divine life to be God s children, but we have also been talented to serve the Lord as His servants.
[192]  In the parable of the talents, we see that the talents were given to the servants according to their ability.
[193]  Our growth in life will determine the time of our maturity.
[194]  If we grow in life and, like the wise virgins, have the extra portion of oil in our vessel and have been transformed, we shall mature earlier.
[195]  While our growth in life determines whether or not we mature early, our work, our exercise, and our use of the talent determines whether or not we share in the Lord s kingship.
[196]  The Bible, especially the New Testament, is a complete revelation.
[197]  In the New Testament we see how the Savior came, was revealed to us, and accomplished redemption for us, and how we can believe in Him, receive salvation, and be regenerated.
[198]  The New Testament also tells us that the saved ones form the church and that we can live the church life on earth today.
[199]  If we fail to do this, not holding on to God s grace and enjoying His riches, we shall suffer loss and punishment.
[200]  In these seven messages we have seen what it means to enter into the Sabbath rest.
[201]  Today Christ is sitting in the heavens enjoying a Sabbath rest because He has accomplished everything to produce the church which is the satisfaction and rest to God.
[202]  As we have already pointed out, that the church is today s Sabbath rest is proved by the fact that the church is the house of God in which the Son of God declares the Father to His brothers and in the midst of which He sings hymns to the Father.
[203]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE AN EVIL HEART OF UNBELIEF
[204]  God had spoken to Moses, saying, Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites...unto a land flowing with milk and honey Exo 3:16-17 .
[205]  After speaking so much about Psalm 95, the writer of Hebrews suddenly says in 4:12, For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[206]  The word for at the beginning of this verse connects it with the preceding verse.
[207]  Why does the writer here suddenly speak of the word of God?
[208]  Because the promise in Psalm 95 is the word of God.
[209]  If it is not, we have not touched the word of God but only the black and white letters.
[210]  The living word of God is energizing within us to work out something for God.
[211]  As the body is our outward organ to contact the physical world, the spirit is our inward organ to contact God Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; John 4:24; Rom 1:9; Ezek.
[212]  Man s three parts correspond to the three sections of God s temple.
[213]  God s temple, or tabernacle, is composed of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.
[214]  Our body corresponds to the outer court; our soul, which is somewhat inward, corresponds to the Holy Place; and our spirit, the innermost part of our being, corresponds to the innermost part of God s temple, the Holy of Holies.
[215]  Now we can understand why the writer of Hebrews spoke in 4:12 of the living word of God piercing into us, dividing our spirit from our soul, and discerning the thoughts and intents of our heart.
[216]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE THREE STAGES OF SALVATION
[217]  According to the whole revelation of the Bible, God s salvation is of three stages.
[218]  The salvation which God intended for the children of Israel to partake of was related to three places: Egypt, from which they were delivered; the wilderness, in which they wandered; and Canaan, into which they entered.
[219]  After wandering in the wilderness, the children of Israel crossed the Jordan River and entered into the good land of Canaan, the third stage of their salvation.
[220]  Here, in the third stage, in the good land, they enjoyed something more than the lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the water they enjoyed the rich produce of the land of Canaan.
[221]  All the rich enjoyment of Christ in the three stages of salvation is for the securing of the good land and the building up of the temple that there might be the expression of God and the divine government of God among men on earth.
[222]  The third stage of our salvation is salvation into our spirit.
[223]  We must all leave the wilderness and cross the river into our spirit, where we enjoy Christ as our life Rom 8:10; 2 Tim 4:22 and where we should live and walk Rom 8:4; Gal 5:16, 25 .
[224]  Here, in the spirit, we have God s habitation, the heavenly ladder, and the gate of heaven.
[225]  Therefore, in our spirit is the expression of God with the kingdom of God.
[226]  We have seen that with them there were three places Egypt, the wilderness, and Canaan that their history in these three places signifies the three stages of their participation in God s full salvation, and that this is a type of us, the New Testament believers, in our participation in the full salvation of God.
[227]  The Lord Jesus firstly was sent from God to us through incarnation 2:14 to be our Apostle 3:1 , our Captain, our Leader 2:10 , the One superior to Moses 3:3 , and our real Joshua 4:8 to bring us, His partners 1:9; 3:14 , into glory and rest 2:10; 4:11 .
[228]  This experience of Christ as our High Priest who bears us on His shoulder and breast and ministers God into us is an experience in the Holy of Holies, where we enjoy God Himself and all His riches.
[229]  Verse fourteen also says that Jesus, the Son of God, is a great High Priest.
[230]  According to our experience, the word great here means excellent, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable.
[231]  Christ today is such an excellent, marvelous, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable High Priest that no human word can fully describe Him.
[232]  Although we cannot find the adequate word in any lexicon, the experience of being on His shoulders and on His breast in the Holy of Holies tells us that He is a great and wonderful High Priest.
[233]  After the unveiling of our High Priest, the writer encourages us to come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help 4:16 .
[234]  The throne of grace is undoubtedly the throne of God which is in heaven Rev 4:2 .
[235]  When we come to the throne of grace through the blood of Christ, we meet with God and commune with Him.
[236]  To the unbelievers and to the demons, the throne of God and of the Lamb is a throne of authority; to us, it is the throne of grace Whenever we come to this throne, we have the sense that something is flowing to water and supply us.
[237]  As we have seen, the very Christ who is sitting on the throne of grace in heaven Rom 8:34 is also now in us Rom 8:10 , that is, in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , where the habitation of God is Eph 2:22 through the Spirit should be rendered in spirit .
[238]  At Bethel, the house of God, the habitation of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the ladder who joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth Gen 28:12-17; John 1:51 .
[239]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE HIGH PRIEST ACCORDING TO
[240]  Aaron, as the high priest, took care of things pertaining to God on behalf of the people v. 1 . Christ is superior to him in taking care of all our cases before God.
[241]  According to the Bible, there are only two orders of the priesthood the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec.
[242]  THE CAUSE OF ETERNAL SALVATION I. THE ETERNAL SALVATION
[243]  The eternal salvation we have in Christ 5:9 is based upon the eternal redemption He has accomplished for us 9:12 , which is much better than the temporary atonement carried out by the priests according to the order of Aaron.
[244]  That temporary atonement covered sin but never put it away; whereas Christ s eternal redemption has put away sin, solving the problem of sin forever.
[245]  Furthermore, Christ s eternal salvation is not merely an objective redemption to solve our problem of sin on the negative side, but also a subjective salvation to save us into His perfection and glorification on the positive side.
[246]  The divine element and nature of Christ are the basic constituents of His eternal salvation, which not only saves us from the most negative things but also saves us into the most positive things, even into God Himself.
[247]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE WORD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
[248]  Although many Christians understand the word of grace Acts 14:3; 20:32 , the word of life Phil 2:16 , and even the good word of God Heb 6:5 , not many know what the word of righteousness is.
[249]  In verses 12 and 13 the writer said of them, For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.
[250]  The Bible itself classifies God s word into two categories milk for babes and solid food for the mature 5:12-13 .
[251]  In Hebrews 5:12, milk refers to the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God.
[252]  After considering the whole book of Hebrews, I have found that it is not only an unveiling of Christ on a higher level but also of God s divine government among His chosen people.
[253]  He earnestly desired and longed to enter into the good land, but God, according to His governmental dealing with him, did not allow him to enter in. Sympathizing with Moses, He did allow him to look upon the good land Deut 3:23-27; 4:21-22; 32:48-52 . By these cases we see that it is a serious thing to touch God s government.
[254]  Hebrews 5:14 says that solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.
[255]  The Greek word translated faculties may also be rendered senses, implying powers of perception, depending not only on our mental capability but also on our spiritual apprehension.
[256]  These senses, implying both our mind and our spirit, discriminate the distinction between the different kinds of words of God.
[257]  The words good and evil used here refer to what is superior in contrast to what is inferior, such as, the superiority of Christ in contrast to the inferiority of the angels, Moses, and Aaron; the superiority of the new covenant in contrast to the inferiority of the old covenant.
[258]  We need to discern, to discriminate, God s word as we do food, asking whether a particular word is like milk or solid food.
[259]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY TO BE BROUGHT ON TO MATURITY
[260]  If we are to go on, we must leave the word of the beginning of Christ 6:1 .
[261]  As we have seen in the previous message, the word of the beginning of Christ is the milk for the babes in Christ.
[262]  The words fallen away in verse 6 refer to the Hebrew Christians deviating from the pure Christian faith by returning to their old, traditional, Judaistic religion.
[263]  In principle, this can be applied to any Christians who fall away from the right track of God s way.
[264]  This verse also speaks of crucifying again for themselves the Son of God, and putting Him to open shame.
[265]  The writer did not open this book by telling the Hebrew believers to go on.
[266]  Now we come to the capstone of all we have covered in these messages fleeing into the refuge with the anchor and the Forerunner 6:9-20 .
[267]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE HEAVENLY MINISTRY
[268]  The book of Hebrews has two main sections, and these two sections are based upon the two aspects of Christ s priesthood.
[269]  This turn is from the outer court on earth to the Holy of Holies in heaven 8:2; 9:11-12, 24 .
[270]  This turn in the book of Hebrews is also from the Christ on earth to the Christ in heaven 7:26 .
[271]  The Christ whom we now experience and enjoy day by day is the Christ in heaven.
[272]  While many Christians are anxious to go to heaven, we are now enjoying the Christ who is in heaven.
[273]  Hebrews turns us from the Christ on earth to the Christ in heaven.
[274]  In His ministry on earth Christ also made propitiation for our sins 2:17 .
[275]  All of those issues became problems between us and God.
[276]  Therefore, at the time when Christ took away sin He also made propitiation for us with God.
[277]  Colossians 1:20 says that through His death Christ reconciled all things to God.
[278]  By ascending to the heavens, Christ has confirmed the new covenant and found eternal redemption 9:12 .
[279]  In the last message we said that our Christ is subjectively objective.
[280]  The Christ in heaven who can be experienced by us subjectively in our spirit is mainly the High Priest.
[281]  The book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly Christ, and the chief point of this heavenly Christ is that He is the High Priest.
[282]  Whenever most Christians speak about Christ as our High Priest, they still cling to the concept that He is the High Priest offering sacrifices to God for our sins.
[283]  This High Priest is of another order, not of the order of Aaron but of the order of Melchisedec.
[284]  Melchisedec was a king, and his name means the king of righteousness.
[285]  In Isaiah 32:1 we see that the title, king of righteousness, also refers to the Lord Jesus.
[286]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE A DIVINE HIGH PRIEST,
[287]  Hebrews 7, a chapter on the priesthood of Christ, reveals two aspects of Christ s priesthood.
[288]  If Christ is to minister the processed God to us as our bread and wine, there must be an environment that is full of righteousness and peace.
[289]  While His kingship maintains a condition that is full of righteousness and peace so that He may minister the processed God to us for our enjoyment, His divinity constitutes Him as a High Priest who is living and full of life so that He may be able to continue His priesthood perpetually.
[290]  In such a One we have the divine birth of the Firstborn Son of God, the birth that produced the many sons of God.
[291]  Christ s being the Only Begotten Son as well as the Firstborn Son of God are both qualifications for Him to be the High Priest v. 28 . He became our High Priest with these two qualifications.
[292]  Christ s becoming our High Priest depends upon both His being the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God.
[293]  Christ is capable because He is living v. 25 . He is available and prevailing also because He is living.
[294]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR THE INDESTRUCTIBLE LIFE
[295]  This message is on the indestructible life, the life that is the essence, element, and constituent of Christ s divine priesthood.
[296]  To say that Christ s priesthood is kingly is not too difficult to grasp because the logic there is not that deep.
[297]  Before we consider the matter of the indestructible life, I need to say more about Christ s divine priesthood being the absence of death.
[298]  Firstly, this indestructible life is the life of God.
[299]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE A HEAVENLY MINISTER
[300]  After the foregoing messages on Christ s kingly priesthood and divine priesthood, we are surely prepared, equipped, and even positioned to hear this message.
[301]  We have seen the two sections of Christ s ministry: the Aaronic section on earth and the kingly and divine section in heaven.
[302]  Romans 8:2 says that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of sin and death, 8:3 says that God has condemned sin in the flesh, and 8:6 says that the mind set on the flesh is death.
[303]  I. A HEAVENLY MINISTER A. A High Priest Sitting on the Throne
[304]  Hebrews 8:1 says that we have a High Priest, Who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.
[305]  His sitting there indicates that the work of redemption has been accomplished by Him, that He is now in glory in the majesty of the Godhead in the heavens, and that He is interceding restfully for the perfecting of His redeemed ones.
[306]  He is not our Aaron standing on earth but our Melchisedec sitting in the heavens, even on the throne of God with the divine majesty.
[307]  After the five foregoing messages, we are now qualified to understand the new covenant.
[308]  In this message we need to see what the new covenant is.
[309]  God s intention is simply to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into us as our life and our everything until eventually He and we, we and He, are mingled together and we become His expression to the whole universe.
[310]  Firstly, on the negative side, because sin had come in as a frustration to the fulfillment of God s purpose, God had to solve all the problems related to sin and to put sin away.
[311]  God has put Himself as life into our spirit, and from our spirit He is developing this divine life into laws that are spreading into all of our inward parts.
[312]  Fourthly, when this life comes into us and is developed into laws that are imparted into our whole being, this life with its laws gives us a spontaneous and automatic inward ability to know God in the way of life.
[313]  The content of this contract is that God assures us that He will take away our sins, that He will put Himself as life into our spirit and develop this life into laws in our inward parts, that He will be God to us and that we will be His people according to the life law, and that we shall have the spontaneous inward ability to know Him.
[314]  What we have received from God is not just an ordinary word as a promise but a covenant, a contract, confirmed by God s oath and sealed with His divine being.
[315]  In order to see the new covenant we must first see the old covenant.
[316]  Imparting of the Law of Life a. One Law Becoming Many Laws
[317]  By imparting His divine life into us, God puts this highest law into our spirit, from whence it spreads into our inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will, and becomes several laws.
[318]  In the new covenant there is also the function of the law of life by which we know God in the inward way of life.
[319]  Verse 11 says, And they shall by no means teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know Me from the little one to the great among them.
[320]  In John 8:55 the Lord Jesus told the Pharisees that they have not known ginosko God the Father even in the outward, objective knowledge , but He knows oida the Father in the inward, subjective consciousness .
[321]  Christ made propitiation for our sins to appease God s righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God s righteousness 2:17 .
[322]  In order to carry out His original intention, God made propitiation through Christ for our sins and granted us the forgiveness of sins so that He might impart the divine life into us for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[323]  In this message we come to a very crucial matter in Hebrews 8 the law of life.
[324]  The crucial matter in Hebrews 7 was the indestructible life, and the crucial matter here in Hebrews 8 is the law of life.
[325]  Although the words, the law of life, are not found in this chapter, what is revealed in this chapter essentially is the law of life.
[326]  Because we are told in verse 10 that God will impart His laws into our mind and inscribe them on our hearts.
[327]  These three things give us a clear picture of the heavenly Minister with a more excellent ministry in the heavenly tabernacle and of the better covenant consummated upon better promises for the fulfillment of God s economy, not in the way of shadows but in the way of reality.
[328]  When the Son, who is God Himself, is realized as the Spirit, He is life to us 2 Cor 3:17a; 1 Cor 15:45b .
[329]  The law of the divine life is then the natural characteristic, the innate, automatic function of the life of God, and since the life of God is the highest, its law is the highest.
[330]  The law of letters is of impossibility, perfecting nothing Rom 8:3, Heb 7:19 , but the law of life is of the power of an indestructible life, perfecting everything for us in fulfilling God s purpose Heb 7:16 .
[331]  In the old covenant, the law of letters was weak and could not possibly perfect anything.
[332]  But in the new covenant, the law of life is powerful; it is of the power of an indestructible life that is able to perfect everything for us in God s economy.
[333]  As the function of the law of life accomplishes metabolically the transformation of life for us, so the issue of the law of life is that we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29 and that Christ is formed in us.
[334]  But we must remember that when He was resurrected from the dead nineteen and a half centuries ago, being born as the Firstborn Son of God, He imparted His life into all of God s chosen and marked-out people.
[335]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE WORKING OF THE LAW OF LIFE I. THE STANDARD MODEL
[336]  God s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us and make us the same as His Firstborn Son.
[337]  Originally, He was the Only Begotten Son of God.
[338]  When this standard model was resurrected, being born in His humanity to be the Firstborn Son of God, He included us 1 Pet 1:3 .
[339]  When He was sonized in His humanity, in His resurrection, we were born as sons of God.
[340]  According to the pure word of the Holy Bible, when Christ was resurrected, He imparted Himself into us as life, and we were reborn.
[341]  Although I have heard many messages saying that Christ is interceding for us, I have not heard one message which said that Christ is interceding for us to be brought into perfection.
[342]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE TYPE OF THE OLD COVENANT
[343]  In this message we come to Hebrews 9:1-15, a passage of Scripture which is very difficult to understand.
[344]  Although the Holy Place is good and in it we may have nourishment and enlightenment, there is no presence of God, no way to come into His presence, no divine speaking, and no meeting with God.
[345]  As we have seen, the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signified that the old covenant was a type 9:1-2, 6, 8-10 .
[346]  The second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies that the new covenant is a reality, not a type vv.
[347]  It was a reality because God s shekinah glory, presence, and speaking were there.
[348]  Since Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world John 1:29 by offering Himself on the cross as the sacrifice for sins once for all Heb 9:14; 10:12 , His blood, which He sprinkled in the heavenly tabernacle 12:24 , has accomplished an eternal redemption for us, even the redemption of the transgressions under the first, the old, covenant 9:15 , which transgressions were only covered by animal blood.
[349]  Verse 14 says, How much more shall the blood of Christ, Who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself spotless to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
[350]  Today in His more excellent ministry with His kingly and divine priesthood, Christ as the Mediator is enforcing the new covenant, and as the Executor is executing the new testament so that the called saints might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance v. 15 . What is the eternal inheritance? It is God Himself with all that He is, has, has done, and will do.
[351]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST
[352]  In this message we need to see the experiences of Christ as portrayed by the arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle.
[353]  Many Christians think that we can only experience Christ as our Savior and Protector.
[354]  Thank God that this is clearly portrayed in His Holy Word by the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle, His dwelling place.
[355]  After the showbread table is the lampstand Exo 40: 24-25 , where we experience Christ as the shining light of life John 1:4; 8:12 .
[356]  That the experience of the lampstand follows the experience of the showbread table indicates that the light comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.
[357]  When we enjoy Christ as our food, we have light because the life is the light of men John 1:4 .
[358]  For eternity we shall have the life supply, but the purpose of the lampstand is to enable God s people to move and act in the dark age.
[359]  As we enjoy Christ as our life, this life becomes the light by which we move and act in God s economy.
[360]  At the incense altar we share in Christ as the sweet incense toward God for our acceptance by God Eph 1:6 .
[361]  IN THE INNERMOST WAY A. At the Ark of Testimony
[362]  Firstly, at the ark of testimony Exo 40:20-21 , we partake of Christ as the embodiment of God for God s testimony Col 2:9; Heb 1:3a .
[363]  God is pure, God is love, God is holy, God is light, etc. Because the law is made according to what God is and expresses God, it is God s testimony.
[364]  The open manna was food for all the people who were outside the dwelling place of God wandering in the wilderness, whereas the hidden manna is for the person who is remaining in the innermost part of God s dwelling place, no longer wandering in the soul but abiding in the presence of God in the spirit.
[365]  In the ark of testimony there is also the budding rod, signifying our experience of Christ as our acceptance by God in resurrection life for authority in the God-given ministry Num 17:3, 5, 8, 10 .
[366]  Within the ark, in the Holy of Holies, that is, within the very Christ who is the embodiment and expression of God, we enjoy Christ as our God-given authority in His resurrection life.
[367]  In the ark of testimony, Christ is also experienced as the tables of the covenant, the tables of the testimony, the ten commandments, that is, as our inward law of life, testifying, enlightening, and regulating us according to God s divine nature Heb 8:10 .
[368]  We have seen the law of the ten commandments was the testimony of God.
[369]  But the inward law of life, which is Christ Himself as the testimony of God, is the real testimony of God.
[370]  When this inward law of life testifies, enlightens, and regulates us according to God s divine nature, it infuses God s divine nature and divine attributes into our being, conforming us to the image of God that we may express Him and represent Him.
[371]  The function of the inward law of life is to permeate and saturate us by infusing into us the elements of the Firstborn Son of God, the standard model, making us a reprint of the standard model so that God might have a corporate expression of Himself to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[372]  We must come forward until we reach the ultimate experience, the inward law of life, the focus of all the experiences of Christ in God s economy.
[373]  When we open ourselves to the Lord and say, Lord Jesus, I love You and I want You to occupy me, possess me, and make me one with You, the divine life, which was sown into our being at the time of Christ s resurrection, will work automatically.
[374]  In this message we shall cover two important matters the new covenant and the new testament.
[375]  The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant, but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us.
[376]  As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than those of animals.
[377]  In the old covenant the high priest was a mortal man, and his ministry was a shadow of the good things to come.
[378]  But the new testament has a High Priest who is the eternal Son of God with a more excellent ministry 8:1-13 .
[379]  His ministry is the ministry of the kingly and divine priesthood in heaven, ministering, by His intercession, the divine life with all its riches as our daily supply to bring us into His perfection and glorification.
[380]  After God made His promises in the Old Testament, confirming them by His oath Gen 22:16-18; Psa 110:4 , the Lord Jesus came and accomplished all that God had promised.
[381]  We have seen that after the Lord left the covenant with us, it became the new testament containing all the accomplished facts as our bequests.
[382]  The Lord s new testament is executed by the resurrected Christ as the Mediator in the heavens 9:15; 12:24 .
[383]  While the Lord is resting on His throne in the heavens, He is concerned for all the heirs of this new testament.
[384]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE TWO MANIFESTATIONS OF CHRIST
[385]  We Christians today need to get into the book of Hebrews.
[386]  I thank God that, under His sovereignty, there was such a group of staggering Hebrew Christians in the first century.
[387]  Christ s first manifestation was also for the accomplishment of an eternal redemption.
[388]  Hebrews 9:12 says that through His own blood He entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption.
[389]  In some of the previous messages we have seen this matter of Christ s heavenly intercession.
[390]  The all-inclusive Spirit works in us according to Christ s heavenly intercession, motivating the law of life within us to function and causing the standard model, the Firstborn Son of God, to be wrought into our being.
[391]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE CHRIST S SACRIFICES
[392]  The book of Hebrews tells us many times that Christ has dealt with sin once for all 1:3; 2:17; 7:27; 9:26; 10:12 .
[393]  The repeated mention of the fact that Christ, through His sacrifice, has put away sin was necessary because of the strength of the Jewish tradition in the ancient times.
[394]  In God s economy, Christ did two main things: He put away sin, which had come in to frustrate God s eternal purpose, and He imparted Himself into us as the divine life which is working within us and spreading into all the inward parts of our being.
[395]  All the sacrifices offered according to the law were a shadow of Christ.
[396]  At the fullness of time, Christ came with a body of blood and flesh to replace the sacrifices of the law.
[397]  In the flesh, He offered Himself to God once for all to take away sins.
[398]  Verses 7, 9, and 10 tell us that it is the will of God to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the old testament, so that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the new testament, might be established to replace the sacrifices of the old testament.
[399]  Christ, as the real sacrifice for sin which has taken away sins, has sanctified us through the offering of His body once for all v. 10 . Sin had separated us from God, but Christ, through His redemption, has separated us from sin and has brought us back to God.
[400]  At this point we need to read verses 15 through 17.
[401]  And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after having said, This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their hearts and upon their minds I will inscribe them; Then He says, And their sins and their lawlessnesses I will by no means remember anymore.
[402]  In this section of the Word, the writer was trying his best to prove to the Hebrew believers that there was no longer any need of offering the sacrifice for sin, because Christ had accomplished the putting away of sins.
[403]  Not only in Isaiah 53:6, 11, and 12 was there the prediction that Christ would bear our sins, but also in Jeremiah 31 there was the testimony of the Holy Spirit that our sins would be taken away and that God would no longer have any remembrance of them.
[404]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR COME FORWARD TO THE HOLY OF HOLIES
[405]  In this message we come to a very sober and solemn portion of the book of Hebrews 10:19-39 .
[406]  We thank God that today the sky is crystal clear above us and we can understand that to come forward means to come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God, and that this means we must come forward to the new covenant dispensation.
[407]  As we have seen, all the things in the Holy Place, such as the showbread table and the lampstand, are the types of Christ, not the reality.
[408]  When Christ s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent, thus opening the way for us who were excluded from God, who is signified by the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 , to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment.
[409]  Through the better sacrifices of Christ, we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies 9:23; 10:19 .
[410]  It is not a small thing to enter the Holy of Holies, for there the very God is sitting on the throne of grace.
[411]  In order to enter into such a place we must have boldness, and we have it by Christ s death and by His blood.
[412]  By the Lord s death and His blood we have the boldness to enter the Holy of Holies at any time we want to, unlike the high priest in the Old Testament, who could only enter into it once a year.
[413]  In order to be the house of God we must come forward to the Holy of Holies, because it is only there that Christ, our High Priest, takes care of the house of God.
[414]  The writer warns the Hebrew believers not to forsake the church to sin willfully, that is, to go back to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin which has been terminated vv.
[415]  For the Hebrew believers at their time and in their situation to forsake the assembling of themselves together would have been to forsake the new covenant way of contacting God, to forsake the church, and to return to their old religion Judaism.
[416]  That would have broken God s administration of grace, thus constituting a serious sin before God.
[417]  This message, entitled Not Eternal Perdition, but Dispensational Punishment, is necessary that we might have a basic foundation in the Lord s recovery.
[418]  The term dispensational punishment is not likely to be found in other Christian books or messages, for it is a new term in the Lord s recovery.
[419]  It is not we who loved Him, but He who loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins 1 John 4:10 .
[420]  Nothing whatsoever shall be able to separate us from the love of God Rom 8:38-39 .
[421]  Furthermore, God has not saved us according to our works, but according to His grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began 2 Tim 1:9 .
[422]  Our salvation is secured not by our works but by God s prevailing grace which comes out of His unchanging love.
[423]  For the showing forth of His righteousness, God must justify us, and He has justified us who believe in the Lord Jesus Rom 3:26 .
[424]  Finally, our salvation is secured by the promise of Christ.
[425]  The Lord Jesus said, All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and him that comes to Me I will by no means cast out John 6:37, Recovery Version .
[426]  Here we see that the Lord promised that He would never reject or forsake anyone who came to Him.
[427]  Those who believe that a saved person can lose his salvation appeal to such verses as Hebrews 10:29, which says, By how much do you think he shall be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
[428]  Yet such a one may be worthy of worse punishment because he has trampled under foot the Son of God, regarded the precious blood of Christ as common, and insulted the Spirit of grace.
[429]  In Hebrews 12:5-11 we have a word of warning concerning us.
[430]  Verses 5 and 6 say, You have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not make light of the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him; for whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives.
[431]  This word mainly refers to God s discipline in this age.
[432]  Verse 7 says, It is for discipline that you are enduring; God is dealing with you as with sons; for what son is there whom the father does not discipline?
[433]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE KINGDOM REWARD AND
[434]  In the fourth warning in the book of Hebrews 10:19-39 , two important things are mentioned the worse punishment v. 29 and the great reward v. 35 . These two phrases are both heavy and meaningful; they are the keys to this fourth warning.
[435]  The writer of this epistle was not concerned with our salvation, for according to what he has written, it is eternally secure.
[436]  The writer has made it quite clear that Christ has offered Himself to put away sin once for all 7:27; 9:26, 28 and that He has obtained for us an eternal salvation 5:9 .
[437]  All the saints in the Lord s recovery must be clear about this, for it is a matter of God s economy, God s way of dealing with His children.
[438]  I. THE ETERNAL SALVATION A. By Grace through Faith
[439]  Eternal salvation, as Ephesians 2:8 clearly reveals, is by grace through faith, having nothing to do with our works.
[440]  Whatever we have done, whatever we are doing, and whatever we shall do cannot affect our salvation.
[441]  It is absolutely a matter of God s grace through our faith in the Lord Jesus.
[442]  In 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, he tells us that he was running the race for the reward.
[443]  Only at the time immediately before his martyrdom did he know for certain that the reward was awaiting him and that the crown of righteousness had been prepared for him and for all who love the Lord s appearing 2 Tim 4:7-8 .
[444]  Hence, according to God s wisdom, in addition to this eternal salvation, a reward is promised as an incentive to us that we may be faithful in our living by the Lord and in our working for Him.
[445]  Verse 39 speaks of the gaining of the soul.
[446]  God has not saved us with the goal that we might go to heaven, but that we might be transformed and conformed to the image of His Son so that God might have for eternity a corporate expression of Himself.
[447]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE UNIQUE WAY OF FAITH
[448]  Hebrews, Romans, and Revelation are the three best composed books in the New Testament.
[449]  In the first ten chapters of Hebrews we have a clear, thorough, and complete comparison between God s economy and man s religion.
[450]  This man-made religion frustrates God s people from going on according to His economy.
[451]  After presenting a thorough comparison of Judaism with God s economy, this book charges the Hebrew believers, who were in danger of shrinking back, to live, walk, and go on by faith 10:38-39 , that is, not by sight 2 Cor 5:7 .
[452]  Because we have been cleansed with the Lord s precious blood, regenerated, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, we are good material for God s economy, and the law of life is able to work Christ into us.
[453]  I. THE UNIQUE WAY OF FAITH A. To Receive the Word of the Gospel by Faith
[454]  In this book faith is first mentioned in chapters three and four.
[455]  In 4:2 we see that faith is the unique way to receive the word of the gospel.
[456]  To take God s new covenant way and to follow the Lord in this way causes us a lot of suffering in material things.
[457]  For this, God has promised us a great reward v. 35 that on earth today we may live by faith and not by sight.
[458]  The believer s life is a life of things hoped for, a life of hope which goes together and abides with faith 1 Pet 1:21; 1 Cor 13:13; Rom 4:18 .
[459]  This is the hope of salvation 1 Thes 5:8 , a blessed hope Titus 2:13 , a good hope 2 Thes 2:16 , the hope of eternal life Titus 1:2; 3:7 , which is the hope of the glory of God Rom 5:2 , the hope of the gospel Col 1:23 , the hope which is laid up for us in heaven Col 1:5 .
[460]  Our God is the God of hope Rom 15:13 , and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope Rom 15:4 all the time in God 1 Pet 1:21 and rejoice in it Rom 12:12 .
[461]  Hebrews 11 is a chapter on faith with its history.
[462]  From verses 3 through 40 it presents a brief history of faith from God s creation, through all the generations of God s chosen people, to all the New Testament believers, consummating with the New Jerusalem in eternity to prove that faith is the unique pathway for God s seekers to receive His promise and take His way.
[463]  By faith he obeyed God s calling to leave his homeland, dwelling as a foreigner in the land of promise vv.
[464]  Verse 22 says, By faith Joseph, when near his end, remembered concerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.
[465]  Moses, choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God v. 25 , esteemed this kind of reproach, the reproach of the Christ of God, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt in Pharaoh s palace, for he looked away to the reward.
[466]  Verse 29 says that by faith the sons of Israel passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do were swallowed up.
[467]  Nothing is mentioned in this chapter of the forty years during which the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, since during that time they did nothing by faith; rather, in those years they provoked God by their unbelief 3:16-18 .
[468]  Although they eventually crossed the Jordan River by faith, the Holy Spirit here made no record of it because it was not pleasing in the eyes of God.
[469]  Verse 40 says, God having in view something better concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
[470]  the Saints in the Shadows of the Old Covenant
[471]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE AUTHOR AND PERFECTER OF FAITH I. THE SAINTS OF THE OLD COVENANT
[472]  In this message we come to the Author and Perfecter of faith 12:2 .
[473]  If you have a heart to seek out the Lord and you read Hebrews 11, you may immediately have the sense that by the people of faith you can have the Lord s presence and His leading.
[474]  THE TRANSFUSION OF FAITH A. We Having No Believing Ability Naturally
[475]  Now we come to the matter of the transfusion of faith.
[476]  As we have seen, according to our natural man, we have no believing ability.
[477]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY RUN THE RACE I. THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A RACE
[478]  God s intention is to put us into Christ and to work Christ into our being, making Christ our standard and all of us a reproduction of the standard.
[479]  MUST RUN THIS RACE A. By Putting Off Every Encumbrance,
[480]  Hebrews 12:1 says, Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting off every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race which is set before us.
[481]  Paul told the Hebrew believers to look away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith, Who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
[482]  In all his other epistles, Paul mainly presents to us the Christ who dwells in our spirit Rom 8:10; 2 Tim 4:22 as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45, ASV to be our life and our everything.
[483]  To enjoy the heavenly Christ we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
[484]  If we look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He, ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth, carrying us through all the lifelong pathway and leading and bringing us into glory 2:10 .
[485]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE DISCIPLINE FOR HOLINESS I. GOD WANTING THE HEBREW BELIEVERS
[486]  One of the basic concepts of this book is that God wanted the Hebrew believers to be holy, to be separated absolutely unto Him, not to remain common in Judaism v. 14; 3:1 , but rather to enter into the Holy of Holies 10:19, 22 . True holiness is to enter into the Holy of Holies.
[487]  Holiness is the inward nature, the nature of the divine life, and righteousness is the outward behavior, the behavior of the sanctified believers, which comes out of the inward nature and which brings forth the peaceable fruit, the fruit of peace v. 11; Isa 32:17 . If we have never been permeated inwardly with God s holy nature, we can never have proper righteousness in our outward behavior.
[488]  God s discipline helps the believers not only to partake of His holiness, but also to make them right with both God and man that in such a condition of righteousness they might enjoy peace as a sweet and peaceable fruit of righteousness.
[489]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO DO NOT FALL AWAY FROM GRACE
[490]  In chapter twelve we have the fifth and final warning in the book of Hebrews.
[491]  According to our experience, whenever we exercise our mind to compromise a little, we can sense deep within our spirit that we are away from God s presence, that we are no longer in the Holy of Holies.
[492]  Now we must ask a crucial question: what is grace?
[493]  When I was young, I was taught by some great teachers that grace means that we do nothing and that God does everything for us.
[494]  According to this teaching, anything we do is work, not grace, but whatever the Lord does for us is grace.
[495]  In 1 Corinthians 15:10 the Apostle Paul says, By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
[496]  One day, as I was comparing this verse with Galatians 2:20 where Paul says, Not I, but Christ liveth in me, I realized that grace is just God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience.
[497]  . In this matter Paul warned the churches of Galatia, which were in the same danger as the Hebrew believers, not to be severed from Christ by being turned aside to the law of the Jewish religion, lest they fall away from the grace of God which is Christ Himself.
[498]  At the showbread table we enjoy Christ as our daily supply, at the lampstand we enjoy Him as our light of life, and at the incense altar we enjoy Him as the resurrection fragrance by which we are accepted by God.
[499]  Verse 28 says, Let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with godly fear and awe.
[500]  According to the implication of the context of this book, the root of bitterness must be some Judaizer who could cause the Hebrew believers to be turned aside from the grace of God to the rituals of Judaism and, neglecting the holiness of God, to thus defile themselves in the sight of God.
[501]  The second cause of falling away from the grace of God is the fornicator.
[502]  When Paul wrote verse 16, he might have had in mind Reuben, the first son of Jacob, who was wrecked by his fleshly lust and thereby lost his birthright Gen 49:3-4; 1 Chron 5:1 .
[503]  By the lust of the flesh, the fornicator is kept from the enjoyment of Christ in God s new covenant.
[504]  Nothing ruins God s people as much as fornication does.
[505]  If we do not exercise our spirit with a God-given authority to rule our self, our flesh, our entire being, and the enemy with all his power of darkness today, how can we be Christ s co-kings and rule the nations with Him in His kingdom Rev 2:26-27 ?
[506]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SIGHT
[507]  In this message we come to a very exciting subject the contrast between the sight of the old covenant and the scene of the new covenant 12:18-24 .
[508]  The next item is the whirlwind v. 18 . A whirlwind is a type of wind that has no direction or peace.
[509]  The first pair consists of Mount Zion v. 22; Psa 2:6; Rev 14:1 and the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem v. 22; 11:10, 16; Rev 22:2 . Here there is no fire but a beautiful mountain with a glorious city, the heavenly Jerusalem, which is God s habitation and the center of His universal administration.
[510]  The second pair is composed of the myriads of angels, that is, the universal gathering v. 22; Rev 5:11 , and the church of the firstborn ones who have been enrolled in the heavens v. 23; 2:12; Luke 10:20 . The Greek word rendered universal gathering may also be translated as festal gathering.
[511]  As the third pair in the scene of the new covenant, we have God, the Judge of all v. 23; Gen 18:25; Psa 94:2 , and the spirits of just men who have been made perfect v. 23 . In this pair, we have the just God as the Judge and the spirits of the just men, who are the Old Testament saints, made perfect through their faith in the types of Christ.
[512]  Moreover, this precious blood speaks to God for us saying that by it as unveiled in this book the new covenant, which is eternal, has been enacted, and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ who receive this covenant by faith.
[513]  Because the eight items of the new covenant are on the side of resurrection, all of them are eternal, existing forever.
[514]  Just as the new heaven and new earth will still remain after the old creation has passed away, so these eight items will remain through eternity.
[515]  Lastly, the dear Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, which is a better covenant, and His precious sprinkled blood, which speaks better things, compose the last pair, indicating that a better covenant has been enacted with His better blood, that He died and has bequeathed this new covenant as a new testament to His believers, and that He is now the Mediator, the Executor, of this new testament to enforce the full realization of all the blessed facts which are contained within it.
[516]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR AN UNSHAKABLE KINGDOM
[517]  . This verse reveals that we have been translated out of one kingdom, Satan s kingdom of darkness, into another kingdom, the kingdom of the Son of God s love.
[518]  If we read Matthew 16:27 in its context, we shall see that the Lord s coming to reward every man according to his work is related to the manifestation of the kingdom.
[519]  If we take the Spirit s exercise and God s discipline in the reality of the kingdom today, we shall receive the Lord s reward and enter into the enjoyment of the coming Sabbath rest 4:9 in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age.
[520]  We shall not be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom at the Lord s coming back; we shall have no right to enter into the glory of the kingdom to participate in Christ s reign in the millennial kingdom; and we shall lose our birthright to inherit the earth in the coming age, to be the royal priests serving God and Christ in His manifested glory, and to be the co-kings with Christ ruling over all the nations with His divine authority Rev 20:4, 6 .
[521]  As we have seen, the loss of the reward in the coming kingdom, the forfeiture of our birthright, does not mean that we shall perish.
[522]  The Hebrew believers had received the kingdom, but they would have lost the reward in the manifestation of the kingdom if they shrank back from the grace of God, from God s new covenant way.
[523]  If we live in this birthright, we shall spontaneously be in the reality of the kingdom of God, for the reality of the kingdom of God is the living out of the birthright, the realization of the full birthright.
[524]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE TEN PRACTICAL VIRTUES
[525]  Apparently, the book of Hebrews does not touch the matter of the church.
[526]  Actually, it is absolutely for the church, because the church is the consummation of God s economy.
[527]  In Hebrews 2 we clearly see that the resurrected Christ with His uplifted humanity is for the church.
[528]  According to 2:12, after His resurrection Christ came back to His brothers and, in the midst of the church, He sang hymns of praise unto the Father.
[529]  Verse 4 says, Let marriage be held in honor among all, and the bed undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
[530]  Verse 7 says, Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God, and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith.
[531]  Their manner of life here must refer to the way of life pursued by those ministers of the word of God without love of money and being satisfied with their circumstances.
[532]  The word which they ministered and the life which they lived should all be Christ, and their faith should be the faith in Christ, of which Christ is both the Author and Perfecter 12:2 .
[533]  The ministers of the word of God should have a manner of life that issues in an example of faith for the church members, the receivers of the word of God, to imitate.
[534]  As the believers consider the issue of the manner of life of those who minister the word of God to them, they will be influenced to imitate their faith in God.
[535]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST
[536]  In this message we come to the experiences of Christ for the church life 13:8-15 .
[537]  Before I come to this matter, however, I am burdened to say a further word about the way, the race, and the paths, particularly about the one race becoming the many paths.
[538]  By looking at the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle, we can see how Christ is the way and the race, and how the one race becomes many paths.
[539]  Verse 8 says, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.
[540]  The Christ, who is the word which the ministers of the word of God in verse 7 preached and taught, who is the life which they lived, and who is the Author and Perfecter of their faith, is perpetual, unchangeable, and unchanging.
[541]  The writer seemed to be telling the Hebrew believers, Brothers, God sent His messengers to preach to you the word of Christ.
[542]  Now the real sin offering is Christ, who has offered Himself to God for our sins and accomplished full redemption for us that we might be brought into the enjoyment of God s grace in Him under the new covenant.
[543]  The Lord s blood, through which He entered into the Holy of Holies 9:12 , has opened a new and living way for us to enter within the veil to enjoy Him in the heavens as the glorified One 10:9-20 ; and His body, which was sacrificed for us on the cross, cut the narrow way of the cross for us to go outside the camp to follow Him on earth as the suffering One.
[544]  If we would be real Christians, we must experience Christ, not in the way of eating a religious meal, but in the way of going outside the camp to bear His reproach, following Him in the sanctifying pathway of the cross.
[545]  If we would experience Him in this aspect, we must enter within the veil, that is, enter into the Holy of Holies, to enjoy Him as our heavenly Sanctifier in His heavenly priesthood 10:19-20; 6:19-20 .
[546]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN ENTER WITHIN THE VEIL
[547]  If we get into the depths of the book of Hebrews, we shall see that the whole book is covered by two things entering within the veil and going outside the camp.
[548]  Inside this unique item are three precious things: the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of the testimony, that is, the law of life which issues in God s expression and testimony.
[549]  To be within the veil is to be in the Holy of Holies, in a realm where we partake of Christ and enjoy the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life which issues in God s corporate expression.
[550]  Since He is within the veil, we also must enter within the veil that we may see Him, look at Him, and consider Him in order to receive the transfusion and infusion of Him.
[551]  Here we are saturated and permeated with all the divine riches that make us the corporate reproduction of the Firstborn Son of God for His expression.
[552]  To be within the veil is to enter into the Holy of Holies where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp is to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast out in rejection.
[553]  This signifies that we must be in our spirit, where, experientially speaking, the practical Holy of Holies is today, and outside religion, where the practical camp is today.
[554]  The more we are in our spirit enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we shall be outside religion following the suffering Jesus.
[555]  The more we contact the heavenly Christ in His glory in our spirit, the more we shall go to the lowly Jesus in His suffering outside religion.
[556]  The book of Hebrews firstly gives us a clear vision of the heavenly Christ and the heavenly Holy of Holies, and then it shows us how to walk the pathway of the cross on the earth, that is, to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, outside religion, bearing His reproach.
[557]  Verses 20 and 21 say, Now the God of peace Who brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant, equip you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to Whom be the glory forever and ever, Amen.
[558]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT EATING AND MANNA
[559]  If we would understand what the hidden manna, the manna in the golden pot, is, we must understand a basic concept in the Bible, a concept which most Christians have not grasped.
[560]  After God created man, He did not do anything with him, nor did He charge him to do anything for Him.
[561]  As we have pointed out, the entire book of Hebrews is focused on Christ as the heavenly Minister with His kingly and divine priesthood.
[562]  He is now ministering such a wonderful supply, not in the outer court, but in the Holy of Holies, and not on the cross, but on the throne of grace.
[563]  We have seen that the book of Hebrews calls us to come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God.
[564]  THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF MANNA Coming with the Dew
[565]  Let us now consider the various aspects of the manna in the Old Testament.
[566]  Numbers 11:9 says, When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
[567]  That manna always comes with the dew signifies that the very Christ who is our manna today always comes with grace, with God s gracious visitation from the heavens.
[568]  The manna in the wilderness was white Exo 16:31 .
[569]  The more we feast on Christ, eating of Him as our manna, the more we are whitened.
[570]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE THE MANNA IN THE GOLDEN POT
[571]  In the last message we laid the foundation for knowing the manna.
[572]  In this message we need to consider the hidden manna, the manna in the golden pot.
[573]  When the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, God gave them manna from heaven as a gift every day except the Sabbath day .
[574]  Then God seemed to say, Take a portion, one tenth of an ephah, of the manna I have given you and place it before My testimony.
[575]  Then God told the priests and the Levites to take one tenth of what they received from the people and offer it to God.
[576]  While we are enjoying Christ as our manna, we must take the best portion and offer it to God, offering Christ to God.
[577]  Eventually, because we are so intimate with God, He will say, Come into My dining room and dine with Me. Do not think that you will suddenly enjoy Christ as your hidden manna if you have never enjoyed Him as your open manna.
[578]  When we enjoy Christ in a general way as our daily supply, we spontaneously desire to offer the very Christ whom we have enjoyed back to God, saying, O God, how I thank You for the Christ whom You have given me.
[579]  God is pleased with this, accepts it, and says, Since you are now with Me in the Holy of Holies, not serving Me in the outer court or in the Holy Place, I would like to serve you with what you have offered to Me. I ask you to enjoy the choicest portion of Christ with Me. How wonderful this is! It closely matches both our experience and the whole revelation of the Bible and fits in with Revelation 2:17.
[580]  In the tabernacle there are three stages of eating: eating the sacrifices around the altar, eating the showbread in the Holy Place, and eating the hidden manna in the golden pot in the Holy of Holies.
[581]  Enjoying Christ at the altar ushers us into the Holy Place, where we enjoy Him in a finer way.
[582]  As we enjoy Christ as our showbread, we experience something still different and say, I am in the Holy of Holies eating something which I have never experienced before.
[583]  As we experience Christ in the outer court and in the Holy Place, we enjoy not only the wave Christ but also the heave Christ, not only the resurrected Christ, but also the uplifted, exalted Christ.
[584]  It is here that we enjoy the hidden Christ, the Christ who is hid in God with us and the Christ with whom we are hid in God.
[585]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY ENJOYING THE HIDDEN MANNA
[586]  IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US AND THE LORD
[587]  In this message we need to consider some principles regarding spiritual food.
[588]  When the children of Israel were in Egypt, they could not eat the manna, because the manna was the spiritual food for God s people in the wilderness.
[589]  Once the manna had been presented to God, it was no longer the open manna; it had become the hidden manna because, after being presented to God, it was placed in a golden pot and hidden in the ark in the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle.
[590]  Some may say that the hidden manna was kept only for a memorial, not for eating.
[591]  If we did not have Revelation 2:17, this argument might have some meaning.
[592]  But in this verse the Lord promises that the omer of manna which is kept in the presence of God as a memorial will be given to the overcomers to eat.
[593]  For those dear ones who do not agree with this marriage but who stay strictly in the presence of God, the Lord has promised them the privilege of eating that portion of Christ which has been kept in the presence of God.
[594]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE BUDDING ROD 1
[595]  Not many Christians have realized the full significance of the budding rod.
[596]  The ark of testimony, the unique unit in the Holy of Holies, signifies Christ as the unique testimony of God.
[597]  This purpose is to gain a people as a corporate unit to contain Him, to be one with Him, and to let Him be one with them that they might be the living expression of the invisible God, and that God might have a kingdom on earth to carry out His economy for His glory and to deal with His enemy.
[598]  Even the New Testament tells us clearly that in God s redemption He has made us priests and kings Rev 1:5-6; 5:9-10 .
[599]  We have the priesthood so that we may express God.
[600]  Both of them must have been about a hundred years of age.
[601]  The leadership among God s children must be Christ Himself as the resurrection life which buds, blossoms, and bears almonds to feed God s people.
[602]  Some may say, I am not an elder and I don t want to be a leader among the Lord s children.
[603]  I want to be free, take it easy, and not be bothered by this kind of thing.
[604]  Although you may say this, I do not believe it, for everyone likes to be a leader.
[605]  Many times in functioning we have used our soul in a rebellious way to show that our soul can do something for God and that we, the natural man, can do some service for God without exercising our spirit.
[606]  Do not consider the children of Israel in Numbers 16 as being separate from one another.
[607]  We must look at them as a collective person, a corporate person, who includes Moses, Aaron, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
[608]  Sometimes we cannot help laughing at ourselves, for we are so ambitious for God, yet we are so rebellious.
[609]  Although we may understand the types of the tabernacle, we cannot know the true significance of the tabernacle until we have had the necessary experiences.
[610]  Recently, a brother gave a testimony about being assigned to a service group.
[611]  When he heard that he had been put on that service group, he wondered whether his position in that group would be the first or last.
[612]  There should be no competition in the church service.
[613]  As we have pointed out, in the ark in the Holy of Holies there were three crucial items: the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tables of the law 9:4 .
[614]  In the past five messages we have somewhat covered the hidden manna and the budding rod.
[615]  I have read some books which say that the law is a type of Christ.
[616]  For a long time, I was troubled by this.
[617]  How can the law, whose position is that of the concubine Gal 4:24 , be a type of Christ?
[618]  Because God is embodied in Christ, Christ is the living, full, and adequate testimony of God.
[619]  If we would thoroughly understand and apprehend the law of life, we must understand the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible.
[620]  The basic and central concept in the Bible is that God intends to work Himself into us in order to make us His living expression.
[621]  God desires to work Himself into His chosen people that they may be born of Him and have Him as their life and thus become His expression.
[622]  The goal is to have God wrought into our being that we might be born of Him and that He might become our life.
[623]  God is now working Himself into us that we may have His life, that we may be one with Him, and that He may be one with us.
[624]  This means that we all have become sons of God.
[625]  We are not simply saved sinners but also sons born of God.
[626]  Before Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead, God had only one Son, the One whom the Bible calls the Only Begotten Son John 3:16 .
[627]  Before His resurrection, Christ was the unique Son of God.
[628]  But after His resurrection, He was no longer the unique Only Begotten Son of God, for in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .
[629]  But Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory, and Romans 8:29 says that Christ is the Firstborn among many brothers.
[630]  This again brings us to the law of life.
[631]  In the previous message we pointed out that the law of life is just Christ Himself.
[632]  The Christ who indwells our spirit is our life.
[633]  Now we know what answer to give whenever we are asked if we are the same as the Son of God.
[634]  But my mind, emotion, and will have not yet been conformed to the Son of God.
[635]  Although my mind, emotion, and will have not yet been conformed to His image, I thank God that I m under the process of conformation.

[637]  BY THE WORKING OF THE LAW OF LIFE THE FIRSTBORN SON BEING THE PROTOTYPE
[638]  The central thought of the whole Bible is that God wants to have many sons for His expression.
[639]  In order to accomplish this, God must firstly have a model, a prototype.
[640]  When Christ came the first time, He came as the Only Begotten Son of God.
[641]  When the demons met the Lord Jesus, they addressed Him as the Son of God Matt 8:29 , but He commanded them not to say this.
[642]  This does not mean that when Christ became the man He was no longer the Son of God, nor that when He became the Spirit He was no longer the man and the Son of God.
[643]  Although we have become sons of God by having the sonship in us, we still do not look like the Son of God.
[644]  Suppose I put a tea bag in a five-gallon jar of water.
[645]  We know that we have received a spirit of sonship because the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God v. 16 . Deep within, we have a strong witness, a strong testimony, that we are the children of God.
[646]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX LIVING ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF LIFE
[647]  After Christ became the same as we are in His incarnation, bringing divinity into humanity, by becoming the life-giving Spirit He brought humanity into divinity.
[648]  The basic revelation of the New Testament, however, is focused on one crucial point: that Christ is one with the Father; that He sends the Spirit, who is just Himself, that He might abide in us and that we might abide in Him; and that Christ is living, moving, and working in our spirit, even transforming our very being that we might be His expression.
[649]  The function of this life nature, or the nature of life, is the working of the law of life.
[650]  When Christ came into us, He brought His wonderful nature into our being.
[651]  Christ is also in us as the ointment which constantly anoints us.
[652]  Whenever the Lord Jesus teaches us from within, His teaching is that of His anointing which gives us this comfortable, soothing sense.
[653]  As Christians, we all have the automatic, spontaneous, constant, and instant working of the law of life, the law which works according to Christ s wonderful nature, and we have the anointing which moves in us according to Christ s Person.
[654]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN THE COMPLETION OF SONSHIP
[655]  God can only satisfy His desire for sonship by having His Son become the model and prototype.
[656]  What is being wrought into us is not only the Savior or the divine life, but also the prototype of the sonship, the Firstborn Son of God.
[657]  In ancient times, God called His people, the children of Israel, out from among the Gentiles and gave them the law.
[658]  Although we may be clear about these matters doctrinally, we may not be clear about them experientially.
[659]  In the church life we should live according to the law of life and move according to the anointing, but we have gradually come to live according to regulations and move according to organization.
[660]  The focus of the divine revelation in the Bible is sonship.
[661]  In order to have His expression, He must have many sons.
[662]  When God sent His Only Begotten Son into the world, His intention was to beget many sons through Him, making Him His Firstborn Son.
[663]  Although the Lord Jesus came the first time as the Only Begotten Son of God, when He comes the second time, He will come as the Firstborn Son Heb 1:6 .
[664]  One day the earth will be filled with the sons of God, and wherever we go, we shall see the image of the Father, the expression of God.
[665]  His way to have the many sons is to make His Only Begotten Son the prototype.
[666]  Christianity misses this, having never seen the difference between the Only Begotten and the Firstborn Son of God.
[667]  Now God is working to spread this divine life and nature into every part of our being, transforming our natural being into that of the Firstborn Son of God.
[668]  Every Christian regards the presence of God as dear and precious.
[669]  In Christianity there is much talk about the presence of God.
[670]  In Christianity, the believers are taught to live and walk in God s presence, and a number of books have been written about living in the presence of God.
[671]  But where can you find a book telling you to live according to the nature of God?
[672]  Although the anointing does not change us, it has a good function.
[673]  Firstly, it rebukes us, and secondly, it tells us to return to the law of life.
[674]  Perhaps all of us have misunderstood 1 John 2:27, which says that the same anointing teacheth you of all things.
[675]  The anointing does not teach us to do everything; it teaches us to abide in Christ.
[676]  As long as we abide in Christ, God does not care where we go or what we do.
[677]  God is not concerned with what we do; He is concerned with what we are according to His nature within us.
[678]  He does not care much about what we say to our wives, but He does care about the life by which we speak to them.
[679]  As God s nature works within us, it makes us exactly the same as He is, transforming us and conforming us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.
[680]  LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW OF LIFE
[681]  In the tabernacle we see a clear picture of the anointing and of the law of life.
[682]  The anointing was upon the tabernacle, for the tabernacle and everything in it were anointed with oil Exo 40:9 .
[683]  In understanding the Bible, we have been influenced too much by our natural concepts.
[684]  In the past, I said that the function of the law of life was to regulate us.
[685]  According to this concept, if we are about to argue with our wife, the law of life will regulate us.
[686]  God s intention is to produce many sons that He may have His full, corporate expression.
[687]  His Only Begotten Son, who is the express image of His substance and the effulgence of His glory 1:3 , became a man to declare Him and to express Him in human life.
[688]  In His humanity, Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, expressed God.
[689]  It is deep in its revelation of Christ as the appointed and anointed One of God, as the Pioneer into the realm of glory, as the Captain of salvation leading His many brothers into His glory, and as the High Priest in His kingly and divine priesthood ministering all that He is in His divinity and humanity and all that He has attained into His brothers to make them the reproduction of Himself so that God may have His corporate expression.
[690]  Hebrews is also deep in its unveiling of the fact that this wonderful Christ is now joined to our spirit, which is the very Holy of Holies of God s dwelling place today, to be our life with the law of life functioning and working to conform us to His image.
[691]  It is through this functioning of the law of life that the very Christ who is now ministering in the heavens can minister all that He is and all that He has accomplished and attained into our very being, not only to transform us, but also to conform us to His image so that we, His many brothers, may be absolutely the same as He is.
