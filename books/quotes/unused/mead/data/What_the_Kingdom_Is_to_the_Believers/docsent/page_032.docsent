   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT WHAT THE KINGDOM IS TO THE BELIEVERS 8 THE WORK OF GOD BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO HIS ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:10-16; 2 Tim 4:6-8, 1-2, 18a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the kingdom of God is a matter of God s reigning, it is also a matter of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible shows that in order to obtain a kingdom, God must bring in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows not only that God grants us His grace but even more that God has an administration toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has an administration toward the entire universe and the whole human race, and much more toward His children and His house, His church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His administration is His government.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not have an inaccurate concept, thinking that God grants us His grace in a light and casual way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s granting us His grace and salvation is for the carrying out of His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All God s work in us is based upon and according to His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has a plan in the entire universe and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything in God s plan must be executed through His governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s salvation is not only a matter of grace but also a matter of His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God in His plan intends to obtain a full kingdom in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He desires to obtain a kingdom that encompasses the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Within the sphere of the entire universe, every single creature will submit to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He desires to bring all the creatures under His divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through such a reign He will be able to carry out His will and fulfill His desire, and as a result, He will be able to express His glory, that is, express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to obtain such a kingdom in the universe, He must take certain steps in His governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE FIRST STEP IN THE EXECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>OF GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GIVING HIS SALVATION TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Satan tempted man to rebel against God, the first step God took in the execution of His administration was to give His salvation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God gives salvation to man so that man may submit to His Son and receive the ruling of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never think that our being saved is something coincidental or accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The coming of salvation to us is a matter of the execution of God s administration upon us; it is the execution of God s divine governmental administration and arrangement upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since God has such a plan, He executes it accordingly, carrying out His salvation in us so that we may become His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE SECOND STEP IN THE EXECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OF GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CAUSING MAN TO SUBMIT TO HIS AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After our salvation the second step of God s administration begins in us He brings a heavenly authority, a heavenly kingdom, upon us and into us to which we must submit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the time we are saved, God s desire is not merely to exhort and teach us to be perfect; rather, He desires to make us perfect through His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If He merely exhorted and taught us to be perfect, it would not be a matter of His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the first step of God s administration is to make us His kingdom, He must take the second step to execute His administration in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After we are saved, He desires that we continually submit to the authority of the kingdom, that is, that we be ruled by the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a matter of His governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not merely a matter of teaching, instructing, nurturing, or exhorting but a matter of carrying out His governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God gave us merely teaching or exhortation, it would indicate that He desired only that we be perfectly good men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, after we are saved, the second step of God s work in us is a governmental administration, a governmental execution.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He requires us to be subject to the authority of the heavens and to be ruled by the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not sufficient for us merely to be perfect, nor is it adequate for us merely to have the thought to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must see that God has a government, an administration, to be carried out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason we conduct ourselves and work in a certain way is not merely so that we would do good but so that we would be ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The reason we do not do things or act in a certain way is not merely to avoid making mistakes but so that we would be ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have clearly seen that today God simply desires that we submit to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the second step of God s administration upon us after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regrettably, after being saved, few submit to this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For instance, after being saved, a brother is brought under God s ruling, which requires him not to lose his temper with his wife as he did before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this point on, his losing his temper with his wife is not only a lack of morality but also an expression of not being restricted or ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that he not only commits an offense against his wife but he also rebels against God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is one who is saved and who has been brought into God s kingdom through His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In him God has a kingdom administration, a governmental execution.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under the ruling of His kingdom God does not permit His children to lose their temper freely or treat their wives loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a brother treats his wife properly, it indicates not only that he is a good husband but also that he submits to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Conversely, if he as a husband does not conduct himself properly in that he loses his temper all the time, it indicates not only that he is not a good husband but also that he rebels against God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that he does not submit to the second step of God s governmental administration.</S>
