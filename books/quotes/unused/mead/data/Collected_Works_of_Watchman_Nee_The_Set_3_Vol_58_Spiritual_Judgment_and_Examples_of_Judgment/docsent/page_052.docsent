   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 32 Date:August 7, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER E. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in 1938, but I touched the Lord's way only five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past my life was caught up with people in military-political circles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day I read in Matthew 7 about entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I began to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I saw that the Lord is my Friend and my world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was willing to become a gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After I was saved, I testified to others all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I loved to sing hymns, to study the Word, and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet I still cherished other things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, I loved my own life; second, I loved my wife; and third, I loved antiques and calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My love for the Lord occupied the fourth or fifth place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, I offered up my antiques and calligraphy, and I had a great release.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I began to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said that I should seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things would be added to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I worked in northwest China.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1947 I came to Shanghai and saw Brother Witness Lee, Brother Yu Cheng-hwa, and Sister Wang and Sister Lee for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I received the life supply from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My inner eyes began to open, and I saw the Body life and the life of coordination, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I thank the Lord for His past guidance in our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that the Lord will fill up his lack this time on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our brother has experienced much leading and dealing from God, but he is still short in faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit in our brother is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unfortunately, our brother's spirit is not strong enough, and his thoughts are not rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe our brother would not mind me saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the Lord's grace that He would deal with us time after time, but our brother needs a fundamental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he experiences this fundamental dealing, all other problems will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not talking about general dealings in life, but about a fundamental dealing for our brother's living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His spirit also has to be empowered for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our brother's problem is that he has a weak spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As ministers, we must have a strong exercise of our spirits; we should push out our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people can never release or exercise their spirit on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person with a strong spirit can exercise and use his spirit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To exercise the spirit is to push it out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our brother has the flow of the spirit, but there is little exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He cannot bring others to any high-peak experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we cannot exercise our spirit freely, our work and testimony will not bring others to a high peak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we can bring others to a high peak, our work will become fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our brother has only experienced some fragmented dealings in life; he has not experienced a fundamental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is short of a strong spirit in the work; he cannot push out his spirit or bring others to a high peak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our brother must learn to be a good minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He must learn to lift his spirit to new heights.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once our spirit is pushed out, it is released.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When our spirit feels something within, we need our mind to translate this feeling into words and then release them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are rich in thoughts, we will be able to know the feeling of the spirit, and we will be able to release the spirit through words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have many words but little spirit because our thoughts are not rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, on the one hand, we have to pray for a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, we have to have rich thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The spirit is released in a spontaneous way; it does not require a loud voice or a solemn face.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a release cannot be imitated, and one cannot force himself to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a minister of the word cannot use his spirit, he will not know when his spirit is supplying others and when his burden is discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have the Holy Spirit within us; He gives us feelings and rich thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we capture these thoughts with our own spirit, our words will become powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are short of utterance because we are poor in thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But sometimes an increase in words is not accompanied by the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to ask the Lord to give us proper words and rich thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we have feelings in our spirit again, we can convey them with proper words through enriched thoughts.</S>
