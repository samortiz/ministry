   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Let His People Go</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That They May Hold a Feast unto Him</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s demand of Pharaoh is seen in 5:1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaking on behalf of the Lord, Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The feast is in contrast with slavery, with rigorous labor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jehovah was telling Pharaoh to release His people from slavery so that they could hold a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words unto me in this verse indicate that when God s people are feasting, He is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their feasting is unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that Jehovah was telling Pharaoh, I am not happy to see My people under slavery in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let them go so that they may feast to make Me happy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I like to see My people feasting and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am glad when they do nothing but eat and rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is a feast unto Me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This feasting unto the Lord is dispensational worship; that is, it is worshipping God according to what has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we eat, drink, praise, sing, and rejoice in the presence of God, we hold a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we shall see, such a feast is also a sacrifice unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To sacrifice is to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dispensational worship is worship in which God is dispensed into us for our enjoyment so that we may feast in His presence with Him and unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the worship God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not only revealed in the New Testament, but also implied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may consider the feast here a festival, a holiday, or a holy day, a time for God s people to rest with God and to enjoy God s provision with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three times a year God ordained special periods of feasting for the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The three main festivals were the Passover, including the feast of unleavened bread; the feast of weeks Pentecost ; and the feast of tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At those times the people were not allowed to do any work; anyone who worked on those festival days would be cut off from God s people Lev 23:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This feasting pleased the Lord because it was worship to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the human concept, people should always be working; but according to the divine concept, God s people should put aside their working for the times of festivals to rest from their busyness and to feast with God in worship to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To hold a feast unto the Lord is to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the natural concept, to worship is to bow down, to kneel down, to prostrate ourselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But according to God, real worship is our enjoyment of God as our provision and then our rest in what we enjoy of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As John 4 discloses, the worship the Father seeks is the drinking of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we drink of His Son as the Spirit, the more worship God the Father receives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Real worship is to drink of God s provision, which is God Himself prepared for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The feast spoken of in 5:1 was to be held in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The wilderness here has a positive meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was the first destination God wanted His people to reach.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the day I was saved, I was immediately brought by God into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The wilderness stands in contrast to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Egypt, which was filled with the culture of the world, there were the treasure cities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God wanted to rescue His people from the treasure cities and from human culture and to bring them into a place of separation in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we were saved, we were in one of the cities on the bank of the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But, in God s salvation, we have been brought out of such cities into the desert, where there is no human culture and no worldly building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To Let Them Go Three Days Journey</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>into the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 3 Moses and Aaron told Pharaoh, Let us go, we pray thee, three days journey into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is significant that this verse speaks of three days, not of two, four, or any other number.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible the number three, especially three days, signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the three days journey, the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea, in which the Egyptian forces were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After passing through the sea, God s people were in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They had passed through death on the night of the Passover, and they were buried in the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, after a journey of three days duration, God s chosen and rescued people were in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some may wonder how the children of Israel could have been buried both in the Red Sea and in the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not hard to understand if we view it in the light of our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the day we were saved, we were saved into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since that time, we have been subject to the effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that in our experience we are crucified and buried again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I cannot tell you how many times I have undergone this crucifixion and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates that our initial, basic Christian experience is the same in nature as our more advanced experience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever we experience in the maturity of our spiritual life will be the same in principle as our experience in the beginning, on the very day of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we were saved, we were placed into the death of Christ, we were buried, and we were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot exhaust the experience of this death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I experienced all this on the day I was saved, although at the time I had no knowledge of it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After I came out of the gospel meeting in which I was saved, I had the sense as I walked on the street that I was in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be in the wilderness is to be on the other side of the Red Sea in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be in such a position is to be a Hebrew, a resurrected and transformed river-crosser.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the normal experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everyone who has been saved in a normal way has taken a three days journey into the wilderness and has experienced death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
