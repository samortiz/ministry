   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 3:2; 12:28; 11:11-12; 19:23-24; 21:43; 13:41, 43; 16:28; Mark 9:1; Eph 5:5; 2 Sam 7:13; Luke 1:32-33; Acts 15:16; 1:6; Matt 25:34; Luke 19:12, 15a; Dan 7:13-14; 2:44; Rev 11:15; 1 Cor 15:24-26</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, there are three major books on the kingdom: Matthew, Hebrews, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Hebrews starts and ends with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 1:8 says, "But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then 12:28 says, "Wherefore, receiving an unshakable kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation also begins with the kingdom: "I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus" 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation continues with the church in the reality of the kingdom and ends with the kingdom in its manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom revealed in the last chapters of Revelation is the consummation of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is in this book that we are told we need to eat Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the tree of life and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter two He is the hidden manna, and in chapter three He is the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end of the book of Revelation a call is issued: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let him who hears also say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely" 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we realize and experience the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not by learning the doctrines about the kingdom, but by eating and drinking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, the eating and drinking of Christ will consummate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because the kingdom is simply the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ will not be enlarged by "mushrooming" overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The enlargement of Christ is by our daily eating.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We eat of Him day by day and bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we eat and drink of Him, the more He spreads within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more He spreads within us, the more the kingdom is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians consider that the kingdom is only a kind of dispensation or sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we must see the life aspect of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Remember the stone in Daniel 2 which is not cut with human hands but eventually becomes a great mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as a piece of stone will become a great mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And Christ as a seed of the kingdom will become the harvest of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way for us to realize Christ as the kingdom is to eat and drink of Him as the tree of life and the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These two items, the tree of life and the water of life, will be our portion for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church life is just a life of eating and drinking of Christ all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a life of doctrines, regulations, and forms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church life is a life of eating of Christ daily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Have you eaten of Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The book of Revelation shows the kingdom in its ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In all the previous chapters, we have mainly seen the life side of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must see the doctrinal side.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to be balanced, we need not only life but also doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The verses in the Scripture reading indicate ten different kinds of kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew 3:2 says, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near."</S>
