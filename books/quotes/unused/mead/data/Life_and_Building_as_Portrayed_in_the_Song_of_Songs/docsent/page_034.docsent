   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOMETHING LACKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet, even after all of these appraisals, she still says, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense" 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of how well others appraise her, including the Lord, she still has the feeling that the day is not breaking and some shadows still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So even at this stage she still desires to have a deeper, fuller experience of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, she goes to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that she will stay there until her day breaks and all the shadows flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why, after such an attainment, are there still shadows and no daybreak?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because regardless of how high she has attained, the Lord's final purpose has not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As to herself, she has satisfaction and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But concerning the Lord's purpose, nothing has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She has attained to such a high state, yet she still feels that something is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is still no daybreak, and there are still some shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So she would take herself to the mountain of the Lord's death and the hill of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE NEED OF MORE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of experience requires a longer period of time to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one can tell how long she stayed there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even today with us, no one knows how long it takes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For some it may be five years, for others seven years, and for others it may be twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need a longer time to stay at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One thing is certain: it could never be accomplished overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot read another chapter in the Bible and stay in the Lord's presence for another half hour, and then you have it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No, we have to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we are too much in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to learn to slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times I was desperate in the Lord's presence, and the Lord told me, "Go to sleep."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was desperate to tell the Lord so many things, but the Lord simply told me, "Go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Don't worry so much."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot stretch ourselves on the bed to be a little taller, and then expect the next day to have grown half a foot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we eat and sleep and exercise, we grow unconsciously, without knowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After many years, we will grow into a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>TRANSFERRED TO LEBANON</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one knows how long this seeker of the Lord Jesus stayed on the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But she remained there until she was transferred somewhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She said that she would get herself to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense, but eventually the Lord called her to leave Mount Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon" 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Myrrh signifies the Lord's death, and frankincense signifies the Lord's resurrection, while Lebanon is a type of the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She said she would get to the mountain of the Lord's death and the hill of the Lord's resurrection, but eventually she arrived at the top of the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The experience of the Lord's death and resurrection transferred her to the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now she is on the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is always the danger that we will be satisfied with what we have attained.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter two, there was the discrepancy between her and the Lord due to her satisfaction with her attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter one, she was seeking the Lord, and she found what she was seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When she received the enjoyment and the satisfaction, she was content to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Lord would not agree for her to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was the cause of a controversy and discrepancy between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord will never be content with any state of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are so easily satisfied with our attainments, but He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How wonderful that she attained to the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only had she experienced so much of the Lord's death and resurrection, but she had attained to the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension.</S>
