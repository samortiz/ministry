   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S REST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In all six days of God's work of creation, His creation of man was distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All His work throughout the six days was for this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His real aim was to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to do this, God first had to repair the ruined earth and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis 2:4 says, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"The heavens and the earth" refer to the creation in the beginning, since at that time it was the heavens that were first formed and then the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the second part, "in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens," refers to His repair and restoration work, since in this work the earth was cared for first and then the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After God restored the ruined earth and heaven, He created the man of His design.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the sixth day, there was the seventh day; on this day God rested from all His work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rest comes after work: work must be first, and then rest may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, work must be completed to entire satisfaction before there can be any rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the work has not been done completely and satisfactorily, there can never be any rest to the mind or heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not, therefore, esteem lightly the fact that God rested after six days of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For God to rest is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was necessary for Him to have gained a certain objective before He could rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How great the power must be which moved such a Creator God to rest!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To cause such a God, who plans so much and who is full of life, to enter into rest requires the greatest strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 2 shows us that God rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How is it that God could rest?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The end of Genesis 1 records that it was because "God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" v. 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the seventh day, He had work to do, and prior to His work, He had a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 11 speaks of the mind of the Lord and His judgments and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 1 speaks of the mystery of His will, His good pleasure, and His foreordained purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 3 also speaks of His foreordained purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From these Scriptures we gather that God is not only a God who works, but a God who purposes and plans.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He delighted to work, He proceeded to work; He worked because He wished to work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He found satisfaction with His work, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we desire to know God's will, His plan, His good pleasure, and His purpose, we have only to look at that which caused Him to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we see that God rests in a certain thing, then we may know that is something He was originally after.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man too cannot rest in that which does not satisfy him; he must gain what he is after and then he will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must not regard this rest lightly, for its meaning is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did not rest in the first six days, but He rested in the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His rest reveals that God accomplished His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did something which made Him rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, He could rest.</S>
