Romans 12 speaks of ministries, and Ephesians 4 speaks of the ministry. The ministry in these two places is different. The "ministry" in Ephesians 4 is singular; it is the same ministry as the apostles' ministry of the word and prayer as recorded in Acts 6. The ministry in Ephesians is "the ministry"; it is unique, and it refers to the ministry of the word, which includes the five kinds of gifts in that chapter. The ministries in Romans 12 are manifold; they are plural in number. Not everyone has a part in the ministry of the word. Only the apostles and the prophets have a part in this ministry. However, every child of God has a share in the ministries of Romans 12. In the local churches all the brothers and sisters have a part in these ministries. Every member has to consider himself and work according to his measure.</p><p>The beginning of Romans 12 speaks of God's mercy. This mercy includes chapters one to eleven. Chapters one to eight cover sanctification, and chapters nine to eleven say that it is not of the one who wills nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy. Chapter twelve goes on to speak about God's mercy. This mercy produces a result, which is consecration. The goal of consecration is for the ministries, which is not to be a preacher, but to serve God. Service is ministry and ministry is service. The words service and ministry are the same word in Greek. This service is like the service of the priests in the Old Testament. There the ones who served at the altar partook of the food of the altar (1 Cor. 9:13).</p><p>A cook can prepare food in the kitchen, but he does not serve the food himself. Rather, the waiter serves the food at the table. This is a picture of the ministry. A ministry is the work of bringing food from one place to another. Originally, the food was far away from you. But now the ministering one brings the food to you, and you can enjoy the food. Those who are serving receive the supply from the Head on the one hand and minister this supply to the brothers and sisters on the other hand. A man receives his ministry from God. He receives such a ministry for the purpose of serving the brothers and sisters and the church. When the brothers and sisters serve together in a local church, everyone should put in his or her portion. This is a different kind of service. Such service cannot be replaced by the ministry. What Acts 6 talks about is a different matter.</p><h2 class="head1">GAINING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES</h2><p>There are two reasons that there is little supply among the brothers and sisters in the local churches. First, there are works of the flesh, and second, the saints have not learned the lesson of submitting to the authority in the church. Because there is the flesh, the responsible brothers are hesitant to let the fleshly ones function, for fear that they will do more damage than good. This actually helps the one-talented ones to bury their gifts. In the end the church neither suffers a loss nor brings in a profit. The flesh does not come any longer, but neither do the one-talented ones come. Today we have to turn the situation around. We can no longer despise the one-talented ones. We have to gain these one-talented ones. Of course, when the one-talented ones come, the flesh comes with them also. But we should not be afraid of this.</p><p>What is the church? The church is all the one-talented ones functioning. When all the dumb ones open their mouths, when all the brothers and sisters speak, and when all the one-talented ones are functioning, we have the church. What we need today is not just the "minister of ministers,'' but the whole church. Here, not only do we have the ministry of the word, but we have all kinds of services. We must never allow the one-talented ones to bury their talents.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
