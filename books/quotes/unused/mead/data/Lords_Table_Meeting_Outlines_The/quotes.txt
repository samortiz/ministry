[2]  OUTLINE ONE THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LORD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:20, 23-25; 10:16-17, 21; Matt 26:26-29 The Lord's table meeting is the bread breaking meeting Acts 20:7 , in which the believers come together to eat the Lord's supper 1 Cor 11:20 and attend the Lord's table 1 Cor 10:21 .
[3]  There are two major aspects of the Lord's table meeting.
[4]  The cup, which we enjoy together and which symbolizes the blood of Christ, removes all barriers between the saints; the bread, which we partake of together and which symbolizes the individual body of Christ, comes into us to make us one bread, signifying the corporate Body of Christ.
[5]  How do we remember the Lord and fellowship with the members of His Body?
[6]  When we eat the Lord's body and drink His blood, we not only receive but also enjoy the Lord Himself and all that He has accomplished by giving His body and shedding His blood; this is to receive, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death.
[7]  There are two minor aspects of the Lord's table meeting: To display the Lord's death 1 Cor 11:26.
[8]  OUTLINE TWO THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LORD 2 Scripture Reading: John 6:33-35, 48; Psa 16:5; 23:5; 116:13; Rev 14:10; Luke 22:19-20; Heb 8:6-13; 9:16-17 The significances of the bread and the cup, both of which are symbols: The bread signifies the Lord's physical body that He gave for us on the cross in order to impart His life into us.
[9]  The bread also signifies the Lord's mystical Body constituted of many members regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, having been enlivened with the Triune God's life and brought into an organic union with the Triune God.
[10]  When we see or receive the bread that we break, we should consider how the Lord became flesh for us, how He died for us in the flesh, and how His body was broken for us and given to us that we may have His life.
[11]  Whenever we drink of the cup, we should consider how the Lord partook of flesh and blood for us Heb 2:14 , how He shed His blood for us, and how He bore our sins, was made sin for us, and was judged and cursed for us; all this was accomplished that we might have the topmost blessing, that is, to be delivered from sin and obtain God and all that is of Him as our cup of blessing.
[12]  Each time in the Lord's table meeting with the bread and the cup, we receive the life supply of the Lord and review the redemption through His blood.
[13]  OUTLINE THREE THE WORSHIP OF THE FATHER Scripture Reading: John 15:26; 16:13-15; 1 Cor 12:3; 1 John 2:1; 2:23; Heb 2:10-12; Psa 22:12-22; John 20:17; Matt 26:26-30; John 17:1-5 The Lord's table meeting not only includes the remembrance of the Lord in the first part but also includes the worship of the Father in the latter part.
[14]  After His resurrection, when did Jesus come to the brothers and sing praises to the Father?
[15]  The practice of the Lord's table meeting: We need to remember the Lord by praising and thanking Him, instead of by praying, asking the Lord to do things for us.
[16]  In the Lord's table meeting, we should not ask the Lord to do things for us, but we should bless the Lord with well-speaking concerning His person and work Rev 5:13; Psa 48:1.

[18]  Whenever we come to the Lord's table to enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive One, in our experience we are in the good land, enjoying all the riches of the land Deut 8:7-11; 1 Cor 1:9; 10:16.
[19]  OUTLINE SIX DISCERNING THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:14-17; 11:17-22, 27-34; James 5:14-15 In 1 Corinthians 11 Paul spoke a strong word to the Corinthians.
