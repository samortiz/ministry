   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The cross signifies God's despair of man!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cross tells us that God has given up hope in man!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The cross tells us that God is proclaiming, "I cannot improve man; I cannot correct him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I cannot make any headway with him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can only crucify him on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The strange thing is that we already know this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We already know that God considers us as being hopeless and that we deserve only to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But at the same time, we still think that we are not that bad.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we make resolutions every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We say, "God, I promise that I will do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From now on, I will no longer lose my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But none of these promises work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes we think that our resolutions are not strong enough, and we try to do a better job the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We make more resolutions, and after we lose our temper, we vow that we will not lose our temper the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we find ourselves still losing it, and we make a third resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was the way Paul lived: "For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was always making resolutions, failing, making resolutions, and failing over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was not only Paul's life but the frequent experience of many of us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, are we through making resolutions?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God says that we only deserve to die and that we are absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He says that there is no hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does it mean to be crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It means that God has given up hope in us and that we have also given up hope in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For God to crucify us with Christ means that God has no further hope.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For us to say that "I am crucified with Christ" means that we also have no further hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God sees through our condition; He knows that we are completely useless and that there is no further hope in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does it mean to be crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It means that we have given up all hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We admit that we can never please God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God can do nothing except put us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no hope in a man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only thing left for us to do is die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We only deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, do you have any sick persons in your home?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have been to five or six homes where the husband, wife, or children were sick.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever the family lost hope in a sick person, they would say, "Mr. Nee, if it be God's will, I hope he or she goes quickly." Why would they say this? They said it because they had no further hope.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When all hope was lost, they wished that the sick one would die quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now God is telling you that there is no further hope in you; He can only crucify you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would be well if you could also say that there is no further hope in you and that the only way is to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our problem today is that we are very familiar with Romans 6, but we are still making resolutions like the person in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We still make promises to God and still think that we are somewhat useful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we are very clear about Romans 6, we are behaving in the way of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Romans 6 God told Paul that he was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Romans 7 Paul told himself that he was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, God is clear about us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He gave up hope on us long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to God's evaluation we are not worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has already told us that we are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The question is how do we evaluate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we also give up hope in ourselves and say that we are useless, we will experience deliverance immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God allows us to lose our temper, to be proud, jealous, and dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He allows sin to turn us upside-down.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is His way of telling us that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But how do we respond?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We think that our first resolution was not strong enough and that we have to make a stronger resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We think that it may work the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But it still does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the experience of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Romans 6 is merely the teaching, whereas Romans 7 leads us into the reality of Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If anyone here told me that I am hopelessly corrupt, I would shout, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I, Watchman Nee, am hopelessly corrupt."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul could do nothing about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He suffered many years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He only deserved to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today if you declare that you are no longer useful, you will experience deliverance immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who try to be good will never be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Similarly, Christians who resolve to be good Christians will never overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brothers and sisters, God's cross has not misjudged you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Day after day, I love to do one thing: I love to declare that I was useless yesterday, that I am useless today, and that I will be useless tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I will be useless forever.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God wants us to accept the appraisal of the cross because by accepting the appraisal of the cross, we accept the Lord as our sanctification, perfection, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we still cherish some hope and still have a glimmer of faith in ourselves, God will have to continue His work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He will not stop operating in us until we completely lose hope in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has to take us to the point that we have no hope in ourselves at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He does this so that we will accept the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God is leading us to this point because He wants us to realize that we are not able in ourselves, and He wants us to acknowledge this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many people realize that they cannot do anything in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, they still have not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This happens because God also requires that we fulfill another condition.</S>
