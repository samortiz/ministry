Actually before that time, even in the years A.D. 200 through 300, the Lord&#8217;s recovery was already in existence. During that time, there were small groups of people, one after another, who saw that the church of their day had become deformed. Thus, they had a strong burden and hope in the depths of their heart and spirit to bring the church back to its earliest condition. This was the beginning of the recovery. Throughout the ages this flow of recovery has not stopped. At the beginning of this century the flow turned from the West and went to China. In 1922 the first church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in China was started in Foochow, which was Brother Nee&#8217;s hometown. It has been sixty-four years since that time, and in all those years the Lord moved in many ways in His recovery while simultaneously releasing much truth and light.<p>Like the other works of the Lord, His recovery is carried out through His word and follows His word, which is the truth. According to church history, the most important accomplishment of the saints who had begun to pay attention to the Lord&#8217;s recovery in the second and third centuries was the recovery of the truth, the Lord&#8217;s word. When the Lord raised up the recovery among us in China, we did not do anything apart from this matter. We just sought to know the truth and to understand the Lord&#8217;s speaking. The Bible clearly shows us that God&#8217;s work is accomplished through His speaking. As soon as He speaks, His move is brought in. Without His speaking, He does not move. Not only is the work of the new creation carried out in this way; even the work of the old creation-the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all things-was accomplished through God&#8217;s speaking. The New Testament tells us that all creation came into being, or was produced, through God&#8217;s word (Heb. 1:2-3; John 1:3; 2 Pet. 3:5). God&#8217;s word is the truth. This is a very important matter.<p>The primary leading one of the Lord&#8217;s recovery in China was Brother Watchman Nee, who had the notable characteristic of being able to see the light of the truth and to recover the way of truth. From that time on, the Lord has never stopped recovering the light of the truth among us. Later I was sent out from mainland China, and it can be said that the recovery of the Lord&#8217;s truth has been even stronger than before. In these past twenty years, especially after the spread of the Lord&#8217;s recovery to the West, the Lord&#8217;s light and truth have been pouring out like a waterfall. The books we publish are far richer in content and greater in number than ever before. For this reason, much of the Lord&#8217;s move has been brought forth.<p>The Lord&#8217;s move does not depend merely on the truth; it depends even more on the vitality of the truth, which is life. In the Lord&#8217;s move, if there is only the truth yet the people themselves are deadened and not living, then everything is still empty. Hence, whenever the Lord reveals and releases the truth, action will follow, and the vitality within the action is life. We can all see one fact: On the one hand, we must confess that we are feeble and small, short of knowledge, and weak in the testimony we live out; yet, on the other hand, we see that if we compare the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the light of the truth and the condition of life among us with what is found among the majority of today&#8217;s Christians, we can only bow our heads to worship and thank the Lord that due to His great mercy we have truly advanced in the matters of truth and life.<p>For the past twenty years my work has been carried out mainly in the West, and most of my writings have been written in English. The most up-to-date vision has recently been published in the book God&#8217;s New Testament Economy. That book consists of forty-four chapters, of which the last nineteen chapters deal exclusively with the New Jerusalem. We can now say that the New Jerusalem is the greatest, most consummate truth in the Bible. Furthermore, not long ago we published seven new books. Among them, three speak mainly about the way of promoting the Lord&#8217;s recovery, while the other four are a collection of messages I gave over the past twenty years in America. Although it has been almost a quarter of a century, those messages are still fresh, living, and full of supply. This is the sweet, wonderful grace bestowed on us by the Lord.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
