<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Eating&#151;to Receive Something In&#151;<br>Being Critical to Man</H2><P>Eating is critical to us because eating is to receive something into us. If you eat the right food, you will receive the nourishment. If you eat something poisonous, you will die. The parents hide all the poisonous things from their children and keep them out of their reach. Even the chemical and drug factories put a warning label on certain things to show that they are poisonous, or they may put their drugs in special containers which cannot be opened by children. What man takes into him is critical. It is a matter of life or death. Eating is critical to man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1.
