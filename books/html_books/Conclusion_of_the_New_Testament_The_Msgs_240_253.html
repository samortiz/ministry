OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>Thus far in these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament we have covered five persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, and the church. Now we come to the kingdom. Like the church and the New Jerusalem, the kingdom is a corporate person. According to chapter two of Daniel, Christ, the heavenly stone, will eventually become a great mountain filling the entire earth (vv. 34-35, 44-45). This is the kingdom as the increase of Christ. In this message we shall begin to consider the aspects of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ITS ASPECTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Kingdom of God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. God&rsquo;s Reign in a General Way</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the kingdom is the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s reign in a general way over the entire universe. This general way of God&rsquo;s reign is the way of authority and power. God rules the heavens, the earth, all created things, and man in a general and objective way.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. From Eternity Past to Eternity Future</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God as God&rsquo;s reign in a general way is from eternity past to eternity future (Heb. 1:8; Psa. 145:13; Dan. 4:3b). Because the kingdom of God is the reigning of God, it follows God&rsquo;s existence. God&rsquo;s existence is from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending. Therefore,</p>
 <h2 class="head4">b. Comprising Seven Items</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the kingdom of God embraces a wide scope. It embraces eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the paradise of Adam, the chosen patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament (Matt. 21:43), the church in the New Testament (Rom. 14:17), the coming millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6), and the new heaven and new earth without end for eternity.</p>
<p>At this point I would refer you to <a href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/KingdomChart.pdf" target="_blank">the chart printed with this message.</a> The seven items included in the kingdom of God can be found in the six circles on the chart. The first circle corresponds to the first item&mdash;eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world. The second circle, signifying the dispensation before law, includes two items&mdash; the paradise of Adam and the chosen patriarchs. The third circle, signifying the dispensation of law, corresponds to the fourth item, that is, to the nation of Israel in the Old Testament. The next circle, signifying the dispensation of grace, corresponds to the church in the New Testament, and the fifth circle, signifying the dispensation of the kingdom, corresponds to the sixth item, which is the coming millennium. Finally, the last circle corresponds to the seventh item, the new heaven and new earth without end for eternity.</p>
<p>Let us consider the fourth and fifth circles in more detail. The column underneath the fourth circle indicates that five matters are included here: the kingdom of the heavens being near (Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 10:7), the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:18-19; 13:24; 22:2), the church (1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 1:22b-23), the reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5&mdash;7), and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 13:24-42). The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is in the church, and outside the church and close to it is the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. Within the church circle there is a smaller, dotted circle signifying the reality of the kingdom of the heavens as the reality of the church life. This dotted circle includes only the overcoming believers. Among the believers there are many defeated ones. Although they are defeated, they, as genuine believers, are members of the church. For this reason, the circle of the church is bigger than the dotted circle of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Furthermore, the two other dotted circles indicate that outside the church there are the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;Christendom&mdash;and the world, the nations.</p>
<p>After the dispensation of grace, there will be the dispensation of the kingdom, the millennium, as represented by the fifth circle. The dotted line through this circle indicates that in the millennium there will be two sections or two parts: the heavenly part and the earthly part. The heavenly part will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, which will include Christ and the overcoming saints. Whoever is in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will be in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium. However, according to Matthew 13, that which constitutes the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will be thrown into the lake of fire and burned. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, composed of the overcoming saints, will actually be the New Jerusalem during the millennium. The second part of the millennium is the earthly part. In the center of this part we have the saved Israelites as the priests teaching the restored nations to serve God. These restored nations will be the peoples around Israel. In the millennium the overcoming saints will be the kings, the saved Israelites will be the priests, and the people will be the restored nations.</p>
<p>After the millennium will come the fullness of the ages, that is, eternity without ending. In eternity future there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center. In this center there will be all God&rsquo;s chosen, called, redeemed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, perfected, and glorified saints. These saints will include those of the Old Testament and of the New Testament. On the one hand, these saints will be kings ruling over the purified nations; on the other hand, they will be priests serving God and Christ. Hence, the kings and priests will be in the New Jerusalem, and the people purified at the end of the millennium to be the people in eternity will be the nations sustained and maintained for eternity by the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2).</p>
<p>If we study the chart carefully, we shall see the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens, which is actually a part of the kingdom of God, God&rsquo;s reign in a general way by authority and power.</p><h2 class="head3">2. God&rsquo;s Reign in a Particular Way</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. In the Sense of Life</h2>
<p>We have seen that God&rsquo;s kingdom is first His reign in a general way. In this way God rules His creation by authority and power. The kingdom of God is also God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life. God&rsquo;s reign in this way is by Himself as life. God&rsquo;s reign in this particular way does not involve that much exercise of authority and power.</p>
<p>In Adam&rsquo;s paradise the kingdom of God was there, ruling over Adam. However, with Adam in paradise we cannot see the kingdom of God in life. The same is true of the patriarchs and of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament. The kingdom of God was present with them but not in the sense of life. However, with the coming of the New Testament dispensation, the kingdom of God turns from God&rsquo;s reign in a general way to His reign in a particular way in the sense of life. Actually, this aspect of the kingdom of God is God Himself in Christ as life.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word to Nicodemus in John 3 reveals God&rsquo;s reign in the sense of life. In verse 3 the Lord says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; To be born anew, to be regenerated, is to have a new birth that brings in a new life. Regeneration is simply to have a life other than the life we already have. We have received the human life from our parents; now we need to receive the divine life from God. Therefore, regeneration means to have the divine life, the life of God, in addition to the human life which we already possess. Regeneration, then, requires another birth in order to possess another life.</p>
<p>Every kingdom has a particular kind of life. The plants in the plant kingdom have the plant life, and the animals in the animal kingdom have the animal life. In the same principle, human beings in the human kingdom have a human life. From the Lord&rsquo;s word to Nicodemus we can see that, if we would know the things of the divine kingdom, we need another life, the divine life, God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God as the reign of God is a divine realm to be entered into, a realm which requires the divine life. Only the divine life can realize the divine things. This was the reason the Lord said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 5). Hence, to see, or to enter into, the kingdom of God requires regeneration with the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. With Christ as the Seed of Life</h2>
<p>The fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark reveals that the kingdom of God in the sense of life is with Christ as the seed of life. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Behold, the sower went out to sow.&rdquo; The sower here signifies the Lord Jesus (Matt. 13:37), who was the Son of God coming to sow Himself as the seed of life (Mark 4:26) in His word (v. 14) into men&rsquo;s hearts that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them. The kingdom of God is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown as the seed of life into His believers. After this seed has been sown into them, it will grow in them and eventually develop into a kingdom.</p>
<p>During His earthly ministry, the Lord Jesus sowed the seed of the kingdom into the human heart. In Mark 4 and Matthew 1&mdash;3 the human heart is likened to soil. Our heart is the field, the soil, into which the Lord Jesus has sown Himself as the seed of life. In the parable of the sower, the Lord Jesus is both the Sower and the seed sown. As the Sower, the Lord sows Himself as the seed of life through His word.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the seed of the kingdom of God, and this seed has been sown into those who believe in Him. Now this seed is growing and developing within the believers. Eventually, this growth and development will have an issue, and the issue will be the kingdom.</p>
<p>In the parable of the seed in Mark 4:26-29 we see the development of the kingdom seed. In verse 26 the Lord says, &ldquo;So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth.&rdquo; The &ldquo;man&rdquo; here is the Lord Jesus as the Sower, and the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; is the seed of the divine life (1 John 3:9; 1 Pet. 1:23) sown into the believers of Christ, indicating that the kingdom of God is a matter of life, the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest.</p>
<p>In verse 27 the Lord continues, &ldquo;And sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens&mdash;how, he does not know.&rdquo; This illustrates the spontaneity of the growth of the seed.</p>
<p>In verses 28 and 29 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;The earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear. But when the fruit permits, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.&rdquo; The &ldquo;earth&rdquo; is the good earth (v. 8), signifying the good heart created by God for His divine life to grow in man. Such a good heart works together with the seed of the divine life sown into it to grow and bear fruit spontaneously for the expression of God.</p>
<p>Mark 4:26-29 reveals that the kingdom of God in the sense of life is a seed that is sown into the earth and grows until it reaches maturity, at which time it is harvested. The seed is Christ, and we are the soil into which He as the seed has been sown. The seed grows and eventually will produce the harvest, the full manifestation of the kingdom. Therefore, the kingdom is the Lord Jesus as the seed of life who has been sown into us and who grows in us until He reaches maturity at the time of harvest. When the crop is ripe, there will be the harvest, the full manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The growth of Christ as the seed of life within us is the process of the kingdom. On the one hand, we are in the kingdom; on the other hand, we are in the process of the kingdom. We may use the growth of wheat as an illustration. In a wheat field seeds are sown into the soil. The seed then grows until the tender young sprouts appear. The growth continues until the sprouts bring forth ears, fruit, and eventually are fully ripened. Then there is the harvest of the field. This is a picture of the process and manifestation of the kingdom. Now we are in the process of the kingdom, for today we have Christ as the seed of life growing within us. Eventually, this growth will bring us to the harvest, and that harvest will be the full manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. With Christ as Its Reality in Life</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God as God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life is with Christ as its reality in life. This is revealed in Luke 17.</p>
<p>In Luke 17:21 the Lord said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;Behold, the kingdom of God is among you.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;you&rdquo; here refers to the questioning Pharisees. The Lord Jesus as the reality of the kingdom in life was not within them but only among them.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s answer to the Pharisees, there is the strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself. The Lord was actually telling the Pharisees that they could not see the kingdom of God, even though it was among them. Although the kingdom of God was present, they did not have the spiritual perception to see it. We need spiritual eyes to see the kingdom of God, which is actually the wonderful person of Christ Himself. The spiritual reality of Christ is actually the kingdom of God in the sense of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God comes, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Look, here! Or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is among you&rdquo; (vv. 20-21). The Lord&rsquo;s word that the kingdom of God &ldquo;does not come with observation&rdquo; indicates that the kingdom of God is not material but spiritual. Verses 22 through 24 prove that the kingdom of God is Christ Himself, who was among the Pharisees when He was asked by them regarding the kingdom. Wherever the Savior is, there is the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is with Him, and He brings it to His disciples (v. 22). He is the seed of the kingdom of God sown into God&rsquo;s people and developing in them into God&rsquo;s ruling realm. Since His resurrection, He is within His believers (John 14:20; Rom. 8:10). Hence, the kingdom of God with Christ as its reality in life is within the church today (Rom. 14:17).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that the kingdom of God is first God&rsquo;s reign in a general way by power and authority and then God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life. In this message we shall cover further aspects of God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Having Drawn Near<br />
at John the Baptist&rsquo;s Preaching</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God as God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way drew near at John the Baptist&rsquo;s preaching (Matt. 3:2). You may wonder why John the Baptist told people to repent for the kingdom had drawn near, since the kingdom of God had been present with Israel in Old Testament times. The reason is that the kingdom of God was about to have a new beginning, to come in a new sense. In the Old Testament the kingdom of God was present in a general sense by authority and power. But now in the New Testament the kingdom of God was to have a new start in a particular way in the sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Having Come in Reality in the Lord&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>First the kingdom of God in the sense of life drew near, and then it came in reality in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 12:28. &ldquo;If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.&rdquo; The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. By the Lord&rsquo;s word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by a man himself but by a man with the Spirit of God. The Lord said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God and that this is the coming of the kingdom of God. Wherever the Spirit of God exercises His authority over the opposing situation, that is the kingdom of God coming in reality.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Going in Parallel with the Church</h2>
<p>The kingdom as God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life goes in parallel with the church. This is revealed clearly in the book of Acts, where the kingdom and the church are frequently mentioned. Many verses speak of the kingdom (Acts 1:3; 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31), and many other verses speak of the church (5:11; 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3-4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28). The kingdom is mentioned first. Acts 1:3 tells us that to the apostles the Lord Jesus &ldquo;presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, through a period of forty days, appearing to them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.&rdquo; This indicates strongly that the kingdom of God would be the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in the coming commission after Pentecost. Before the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens and poured out Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit to establish the church, He taught His disciples about the kingdom. If they had not had any knowledge or realization concerning the kingdom, it would have been difficult for the Lord Jesus to bring them into the church. Therefore, in the first chapter of Acts the kingdom was taught thoroughly.</p>
<p>In the following chapters of Acts the church is brought in. The first mention of the church is in Acts 5:11. Acts 8:1 refers to the church in Jerusalem. Throughout the book of Acts the church is mentioned again and again. However, after the church comes in, the kingdom is still preached. In 8:12 Philip brought the good news concerning the kingdom of God to the Samaritans. Acts 14:22 says that &ldquo;through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; According to 19:8, Paul spoke boldly in the synagogue concerning the kingdom of God. Furthermore, 20:25 tells us that Paul went about proclaiming the kingdom. Finally, in 28:23 Paul &ldquo;expounded and solemnly testified the kingdom of God&rdquo; to those who came to him in his lodging. From this we can see that the book of Acts begins and ends with the kingdom of God. Moreover, Acts shows us that the kingdom and the church are a pair, for the kingdom goes in parallel with the church. Without the kingdom there is neither the beginning nor the conclusion of the church life. The church life is intimately related to the kingdom because the kingdom is the life pulse of the church. Therefore, the kingdom is absolutely crucial to the church life.</p>
<p>Some Bible teachers have mistakenly taught that the kingdom has been suspended. According to their understanding, due to rejection by the Jews, the kingdom has been suspended, the present age is the age of the church, and the kingdom will come back after the church age. This interpretation may be correct in one aspect of the truth concerning the kingdom but not in all aspects. In the aspect of life the kingdom has not been suspended. Yes, in the Gospels the Jews rejected the Lord&rsquo;s presentation of the kingdom to them. Nevertheless, in Acts 1:3 the Lord, after His resurrection and after breathing Himself as the Spirit of life into the disciples, stayed with them for forty days in order to teach them the things concerning the kingdom. As we have seen, later in Acts we have the church and the preaching of the kingdom of God as the gospel.</p>
<p>Because the kingdom and the church are in parallel we cannot separate them. Actually, the kingdom and the church are one thing in different aspects and with different terminology. When we speak of the church, the kingdom also is present. When we speak of the kingdom in the sense of life, the church is present as well. As believers in Christ, we need to live in the kingdom, and we also need to be in the church and live in the church both in reality and in practicality. This means that we need to have the practice of the church life. We need to be a church people, living in the reality of the church according to the truth and also living in the practicality of the church, practicing the church life wherever we may be. If we live in the kingdom and in the church, then we shall also live in the Body.</p><h2 class="head4">g. Being the Reality of the Church Life</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God in the sense of life is the reality of the church life. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse is a strong proof that the church in the present age is the kingdom of God, because the context here is dealing with the church life in the present age. In this verse Paul does not say that the kingdom of God <em>shall be;</em> he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God <em>is.</em> According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today&rsquo;s church life. The reality of the church life is the kingdom. Romans 12 speaks of the Body life, and Romans 14 speaks of the kingdom life. This indicates that, according to the book of Romans, the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life&mdash; the church life.</p>
<p>In 14:17 we see that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. When we live in the reality of God&rsquo;s kingdom, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life. We shall be righteous toward ourselves, we shall have peace toward others, and we shall have joy with God.</p>
<p>As we live the kingdom life in the church, we live righteously toward ourselves. This means that we are strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves in anything we do.</p>
<p>To live the kingdom life in the church also means that we live peacefully toward others. This indicates that our relationship with others must be characterized by peace. Toward others we must endeavor to pursue peace, continually seeking to be at peace with them. We must be careful to maintain peace with everyone related to us. Such a peace is always related to righteousness. If we do not have righteousness, we cannot have peace. Righteousness must come first, and then peace will follow. If we are righteous toward ourselves, we shall be at peace with others.</p>
<p>Living the kingdom life in the church requires that we live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy. Therefore, if we are truly living the kingdom life, we shall be joyful with God, praising Him. The more we live righteously toward ourselves, peacefully toward others, and joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit, the more the kingdom will be manifested in our daily living in the church life. This is the kingdom in the sense of life being the reality of the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Regeneration Being Its Initial Entrance</h2>
<p>As believers, we have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5). This means that our regeneration was the initial entrance into God&rsquo;s kingdom. To be regenerated, therefore, is to enter into the kingdom of God. All believers in Christ have entered the kingdom of God by being regenerated into it. This is the reason the Lord Jesus said in John 3:3, &ldquo;Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; In verse 5 He goes on to say, &ldquo;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; These verses are a clear revelation of the fact that regeneration is the unique entrance into the kingdom of God. In order to enter into the kingdom of God, we need to be born again. There is no other way for us to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>A kingdom is always related to life. The vegetable kingdom is related to the vegetable life, and the animal kingdom is related to the animal life. In order to share in a certain kingdom, we first need the life of that kingdom. If we did not have human life, we could not have entered the human kingdom. Only human beings can participate in the human kingdom because only they have a human life. Likewise, if we did not have the divine life, the life of God, we could not enter the kingdom of God. In order to enter the divine kingdom, we must have the divine life. Because through regeneration we received the divine life, regeneration was our initial entrance into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is not only the reign of God but also the divine realm or sphere. In order to participate in the reign of God and to be in the divine realm, we need the divine life. Only those who have the divine life can be in the divine realm and share the divine kingdom. We need to be regenerated that we may have the divine life, the life which enables us to enter into the divine realm and participate in the divine kingdom. No matter how good, clean, and pure our human life may be, it is not able to realize the things of the divine realm, and it is not qualified to enter into the divine kingdom. Only the divine life is qualified to be in the divine realm.</p>
<p>We all were born into the human kingdom. No one has ever been naturalized into the kingdom of man. The principle is the same with the kingdom of God. The divine life brings us into the kingdom of God. This is the reason the Lord Jesus says that we must be born into the kingdom of God. We cannot enter into the kingdom of God by learning or by being naturalized. We enter the kingdom of God only by regeneration. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and called on His name, the divine Spirit came into us, regenerated us, and caused us to be born into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">i. A Present Incentive to the Believers<br />
to Suffer the Tribulation with Endurance in Jesus</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God as God&rsquo;s reign in the sense of life is a present incentive to the believers to suffer the tribulation with endurance in Jesus. This is indicated by John&rsquo;s word in Revelation 1:9a: &ldquo;I John, your brother and joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.&rdquo; Although John was on the isle of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:9b), he was there living the kingdom life. That kingdom life was the incentive that encouraged him to suffer persecution and tribulation with all endurance. Therefore, he could still be happy and work for the Lord, for within him he had the kingdom of God in life as an incentive.</p>
<p>We partake of the kingdom both in tribulation and in endurance. If we do not have endurance, we shall be able to withstand tribulation only for a limited time. As we live in Christ, we partake not only of His life but also of His endurance. When we abide in Christ, we partake of His endurance and have the endurance to bear suffering and opposition. We suffer tribulation with endurance in Jesus with God&rsquo;s kingdom in life as our incentive.</p>
<h2 class="head4">j. A Destination for the Believers to Reach</h2>
<p>In Acts 14:22 we see that Paul and Barnabas told the disciples that &ldquo;through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; The entrance here is not the initial entrance but the ultimate entrance. Instead of being frustrations, the tribulations are the way that ushers us into the kingdom. Today we are on the way to enter into the kingdom of God as our destination. Actually, our going on in the way to enter into the final entrance of the kingdom of God is the developing of the kingdom of God. The more we go on, the more the kingdom of God is developed among us.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God in the sense of life is actually Christ Himself (Luke 17:21) as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&rsquo;s chosen people (Mark 4:3, 26), and developing into a realm in which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Its entrance is regeneration (John 3:5), and its development is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life (2 Pet. 1:3-11). It is the church life today in which the faithful believers live (Rom. 14:17), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) to the overcoming saints in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life for all God&rsquo;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head4">k. A Blessing for the Believers to Inherit</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God in the sense of life is also a blessing for the believers to inherit. Eventually, if we live in the reality of the kingdom, we shall inherit the kingdom of God. Inheriting the kingdom of God is different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration. Having entered into the kingdom of God by being regenerated, we need to grow and develop in the divine life. Then, as a result of this growth and development, we shall inherit the kingdom of God as a blessing.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:10 Paul speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God. The word &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; here implies enjoyment. Thus, to inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom. The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers. According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord. To inherit the kingdom, therefore, is not simply to enter the kingdom but to receive the kingdom as a reward, as a blessing, for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>In Galatians 5:21 Paul again speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God. Once again, the inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward. This is not related to a believer&rsquo;s salvation. Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21 are saved, but they will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</p>
<p>In Luke 12:31 and 32 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Seek His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you. Do not fear, little flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom.&rdquo; Here the Lord is referring to the kingdom of God as a blessing for the believers to receive from the Father.</p>
<p>Another verse that speaks of the kingdom as a blessing for the believers to inherit is James 2:5. &ldquo;Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?&rdquo; The kingdom here is the kingdom of God and also the kingdom of Christ (Eph. 5:5), which will be inherited by the overcoming believers as a reward for their enjoyment in the coming age.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In the two foregoing messages we covered the first aspect of the kingdom, the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, the main and basic aspect of the kingdom, is first God&rsquo;s reign in a general way by power and authority and then God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life. Now we come to the second aspect of the kingdom&mdash;the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Ruling of the Heavens</h2>
<p>Daniel 4:26 says, &ldquo;The heavens do rule.&rdquo; This actually refers to the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly rule, heaven ruling over all things.</p>
<p>In the New Testament a form of the word &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; is used many times. For instance, Hebrews 3:1 tells us that we are &ldquo;partakers of a heavenly calling.&rdquo; The concept of the book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly nature of the positive things. First, this book points out that Christ today is sitting in the heavens (1:3). He has entered into the heavens (9:24), He has passed through the heavens (4:14), and He has become higher than the heavens (7:26). Then Hebrews reveals to us that we have received a heavenly call. According to the book of Hebrews, God&rsquo;s call is the heavenly call. In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus is actually referring to heaven when He says, &ldquo;Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;anew&rdquo; can also be rendered &ldquo;from above,&rdquo; that is, from heaven. The regenerated ones are those who have been born from above, from the heavens. Therefore, our source is not the earth but the heavens.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 and 48 say, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven. As is the earthy, such also are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.&rdquo; The first man is Adam and the second Man is Christ. As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second Man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In verse 48 &ldquo;the earthy&rdquo; refers to the first man Adam, who is earthy, and &ldquo;they that are earthy&rdquo; denotes all of Adam&rsquo;s descendants, who are earthy as Adam. Likewise, &ldquo;the heavenly&rdquo; denotes the second Man Christ, who is heavenly, and &ldquo;they also that are heavenly&rdquo; denotes all the believers in Christ, who are heavenly as Christ. The first man was earthy because he was of the earth; the second Man is heavenly because He is out of heaven. The Savior we have received and the divine life we have received are of the same origin, the same source, which is the heavens.</p>
<p>Hebrews 6:4 speaks of the believers&rsquo; tasting &ldquo;of the heavenly gift.&rdquo; The heavenly gift refers to God&rsquo;s giving of the heavenly things, such as His forgiveness, righteousness, divine life, peace, and joy, at the time of our conversion. This verse says that we have tasted of this heavenly gift. This indicates that from the time of our regeneration, we have had a taste for heavenly things, a heavenly taste.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 2:6, the believers have been seated &ldquo;together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Heavenlies&rdquo; here indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, atmosphere, and element. We are now sitting in such a heavenly sphere, condition, and situation.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:20 Paul says, &ldquo;Our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;commonwealth&rdquo; or &ldquo;associations of life.&rdquo; Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens. Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens. Our calling, rebirth, nature, atmosphere, environment, and sphere are heavenly. Therefore, we are heavenly citizens.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, our situation was like that of the prodigal son in Luke 15&mdash;rebellion against the heavens. When the prodigal son returned to his father, he repented and said, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you&rdquo; (v. 21). &ldquo;Against heaven&rdquo; equals &ldquo;before you&rdquo; (God the Father). Sinning against heaven is sinning before God, because God the Father is in heaven (Luke 11:2). After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens. We have even become heavenly citizens. This means that today we are under a rule that is with the heavenly nature. As we shall see, this rule is in our spirit, for this rule is nothing other than the living One, Christ consummated as the life-giving Spirit. This One, the life-giving Spirit, indwelling us is the heavenly rule within us, and this heavenly rule is actually the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head3">2. A Specific Section within the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>If we consult the chart printed in message two hundred forty, we shall see that the kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God. It is in that section of the kingdom of God which is God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way, in the sense of life. With the patriarchs and children of Israel the kingdom of God was present in a general way but not in a particular way. For this reason, at the beginning of the New Testament, John the Baptist called on people to repent because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near (Matt. 3:2). This indicates a new beginning. The kingdom of God was there, yet it needed a new beginning. This new beginning was the kingdom of God in a particular way, in the way of life. Although the Israelites in Old Testament times were in God&rsquo;s kingdom, they were in the kingdom only in the sense of God&rsquo;s power and authority, not in the sense of life. To be in the kingdom of God in the sense of life is something new, something of the new testament. Therefore, when the new testament was coming, God sent John the Baptist as the forerunner to tell people to prepare themselves to get into another stage of the kingdom and not to remain in the old stage. God was about to have a new start, a start in life. Therefore, it was necessary for the people to prepare themselves to enter into this new start, that is, to enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom by being regenerated. Through regeneration we enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom in the way of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Being Called Also the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens as a specific section within the kingdom of God is also called the kingdom of God. This becomes clear if we compare Matthew 4:17 with Mark 1:15 and Matthew 13:11 with Mark 4:11. Matthew 4:17 says, &ldquo;From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; According to Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.&rdquo; This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God. In Matthew 13:11 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; However, in Mark 4:11 He says, &ldquo;To you the mystery of the kingdom of God has been given.&rdquo; This is another indication that the kingdom of the heavens, being part of the kingdom of God, is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Although we can say that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God, we cannot say that the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God just as Texas, as a part of the United States, is the United States.</p>
<p>Matthew 19:23 and 24 say, &ldquo;Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Verse 23 refers to the kingdom of the heavens, whereas verse 24 refers to the kingdom of God. This is a further proof that the kingdom of the heavens is a part of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>We have seen that the kingdom of the heavens is different from the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God was already present before the kingdom of the heavens came. Matthew 19:23 and 24, however, prove that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God. The illustration of Texas and the United States helps to explain this. On the one hand, Texas is different from the United States, because the United States is an entire nation. Texas is a part of this nation, so it is different. On the other hand, Texas is in the United States. When you come to Texas, you come to the United States. Likewise, when you enter into the kingdom of the heavens, you enter into the kingdom of God because the kingdom of the heavens is a part of the kingdom of God. If you are in Texas, you are in the United States. But if you are in the United States, you are not necessarily in Texas, for you may be in another state. If you enter into the kingdom of the heavens, you surely enter into the kingdom of God. However, being in the kingdom of God does not guarantee that you are in the kingdom of the heavens. From this we see that although the kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens may also be called the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In the Age of the Church<br />
and in the Age of the Millennium</h2>
<p>As a particular section of the kingdom of God in the way of life, the kingdom of the heavens comprises two ages or dispensations: the dispensation of grace and the dispensation of the kingdom. Today we are in the dispensation of grace, which is the age of the church life. The dispensation of grace is altogether a matter of life. The age of grace is the age of the church life. This indicates clearly that the church is a matter of life. Within the church there is the kingdom of God in the way of life, and this kingdom of God in the way of life is the kingdom of the heavens, which makes all the kingdom people heavenly in everything and in every way, causing them to be people of the heavens. After the age of the church, the kingdom of the heavens will continue in the age of the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Having Drawn Near<br />
at John the Baptist&rsquo;s Preaching<br />
and at the Preachings<br />
of Christ and His Disciples</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens drew near at John the Baptist&rsquo;s preaching and at the preachings of Christ and His disciples. In his preaching John said, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). This clearly indicates that before the coming of John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was not there. Even after his appearance, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near.</p>
<p>At the time the Lord Jesus started His ministry and even at the time He sent His disciples to preach, the kingdom of the heavens still had not come. In Matthew 4:17 the Lord Jesus &ldquo;began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,&rdquo; continuing the preaching of His forerunner. In Matthew 10:7 the Lord charged His disciples to preach, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; This indicates that even at that time the kingdom of the heavens had not come, but had only drawn near.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Having Begun at the Church&rsquo;s Beginning</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens began at the church&rsquo;s beginning. This means that when the church began on the day of Pentecost, the kingdom of the heavens also began.</p>
<p>The beginning of the kingdom of the heavens is indicated by the parable of the tares in Matthew 13. Of the seven parables in this chapter, only one of them, the first, does not liken the kingdom of the heavens to something (vv. 3, 24, 31, 33, 44, 45, and 47). It is in the second parable, the parable of the tares, that the Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field&rdquo; (v. 24). The reason the Lord began to say, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to&rdquo; in this parable is that the kingdom of the heavens began to be established when the church was built on the day of Pentecost, the time when the second parable began to be fulfilled. It was from that time, after the church was founded (Acts 5:11), that the tares, the false believers, were sown amidst the true believers, the wheat. The kingdom of the heavens and the church began at the same time and go on in parallel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Being Wrapped Up with the Church</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18 and 19 indicates that the kingdom of the heavens is wrapped up with the church. &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in the heavens.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; in verse 19 are interchangeably used for the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; in verse 18. This is a strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. The church has the kingdom of the heavens as its reality.</p>
<p>The keys of the kingdom of the heavens are given to the apostles. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s word to Peter concerning giving him the keys of the kingdom of the heavens for binding and loosing. The Gospel of Matthew is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens. The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom to reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose is given not only to Peter but also to the church itself (Matt. 18:17-18). Since the kingdom of the heavens is wrapped up with the church, when we have one, we have the other. Where the genuine church is, there the kingdom of the heavens is also.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>We have seen that the kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens, that it is a specific section within the kingdom of God, that it drew near at John the Baptist&rsquo;s preaching and at the preachings of Christ and His disciples, that it began at the church&rsquo;s beginning, and that it is wrapped up with the church. In this message we shall go on to see the three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Its Three Aspects</h2>
<p>According to the Gospel of Matthew, there are three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed in chapters five through seven. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in chapter thirteen. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as revealed in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17), which is within the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom. If we have a full understanding of these three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens, we shall know the truth of the kingdom of the heavens in a very thorough way.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Its Reality as Revealed in Matthew 5&mdash;7</h2>
<p>Matthew 5&mdash;7 reveals the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The word spoken by the Lord Jesus in these chapters is the revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Reality of the Overcoming Church Life</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the reality of the overcoming church life. The record of Matthew 5&mdash;7 gives us a view of a certain kind of reality, the reality of the high standard of the divine life. This is the overcoming church life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Existing within the Church in the Church Age</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens exists today within the church in the church age. However, there is not much of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in today&rsquo;s Christianity. We hope that among us in the church life the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will increase continually.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) An Exercise to the Seeking Believers</h2>
<p>A number of verses in Matthew indicate that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is an exercise to the seeking believers. Matthew 5:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The spirit here refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ for us to contact God and realize spiritual things. To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things but being unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens. We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, if we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is ours. This means that if we are poor in spirit, we are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens now in the church age.</p>
<p>Anyone who is not poor in spirit but instead is proud and full in his spirit is not under the exercise of the kingdom of the heavens. If we are poor in spirit, we shall say, &ldquo;Lord, I know nothing. Have mercy on me. Lord, I am poor in my spirit and I am hungry after You.&rdquo; If we pray in this way, being poor in spirit, we shall be under the exercise of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:10 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and is filled with unrighteousness. Every aspect of the world is unrighteous. If we hunger and thirst for righteousness (Matt. 5:6), we shall be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. This indicates that we need to pay a price for the righteousness we seek for the kingdom of the heavens. If we are righteous, we shall be condemned, opposed, and persecuted. This is another aspect of the exercise of the kingdom of the heavens in its reality.</p>
<p>In 5:10 the Lord tells us that those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed, &ldquo;for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; If we seek righteousness at a cost, the kingdom of the heavens becomes ours. If we suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness, ours is the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that suffering for the sake of righteousness is a condition for participation in the kingdom of the heavens. If we do not remain in righteousness, we are outside the kingdom. But if we stay in righteousness, we are in the kingdom because the kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness. As we seek righteousness, we should be prepared to confront persecution. We shall be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. If we are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, we are truly under the exercise of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The surpassing righteousness is the condition of entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium. By keeping the highest law to the highest standard, we fulfill the condition for entering into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In 5:20 righteousness does not refer to the objective righteousness, which is the Christ we receive when we believe in Him that we may be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26). The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 5:20 refers to the subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is not obtained merely by fulfilling the old law, but by completing the old law through the fulfillment of the new law for the kingdom of the heavens, the law given by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5:17-48. This righteousness of the believers according to the new law of the kingdom surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by the divine life, the resurrection life of Christ.</p>
<p>To enter into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life (John 3:3, 5), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration. To enter into the kingdom of the heavens means to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future.</p>
<p>In Matthew 7:21 the Lord says, &ldquo;Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (Rom. 10:13), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Because entering into the kingdom of the heavens requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God by being regenerated (John 3:3, 5). This latter is by the birth of the divine life; the former is by the living of that life.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Its Appearance as Revealed in Matthew 13:24-43<br />
through the Parables of the Tares,<br />
the Mustard Seed, and the Leaven</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Appearance of Christendom</h2>
<p>In Matthew 13:24-43 the appearance of Christendom as the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed through the parables of the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven. The parable of the tares (13:24-30, 36-43) reveals the establishment of the kingdom and its false constituents. Verses 24 and 25 say, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares amidst the wheat and went away.&rdquo; The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man (v. 37), the field is the world, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one (v. 38). Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field; that is, the false believers and the true ones live in the world. The kingdom of the heavens was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, but the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation. Hence, a difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance. Whereas the sons of the kingdom constitute the kingdom, the sons of the evil one have formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom.</p>
<p>In 13:31 and 32 we have a parable telling of the abnormal development of the outward appearance of the kingdom. &ldquo;Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is indeed smaller than all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.&rdquo; The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a tree, a lodge for birds, having its nature and function changed. (This is against the law of God&rsquo;s creation that every plant must be after its kind&mdash;Gen. 1:11-12.) This happened when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world in the first part of the fourth century. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this parable corresponds to the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos (2:12-17), which signifies the church in union with the world through Constantine&rsquo;s influence. Multitudes of unbelievers were baptized and the &ldquo;church&rdquo; became monstrously great. The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard herb, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled in the earth as a tree, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches to lodge many evil persons and things. This has formed the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:33 we have a parable concerning the inward corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom. &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; Leaven in Scripture signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12). The meal here, for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifies Christ as food for God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ&mdash;the unleavened fine flour&mdash;as its contents, should be unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified here by the woman, took many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity. Hence, the hiding of leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This became the inward, corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Existing along with the Church<br />
in the Church Age</h2>
<p>The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens exists along with the church in the church age, but it does not exist within the church. As a principle, we do not allow tares in the church life, and we do not allow the big tree with its abnormal growth or the leaven with its corruption to be in the church.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Its Manifestation as Revealed<br />
in Matthew 24:44&mdash;25:30</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be realized. This is revealed in Matthew 24:44&mdash;25:30. Only the overcomers who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will have a share in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be a reward, a prize, given to the overcomers.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Manifestation of the Reality<br />
of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This means that in the next age the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<p>During the present age, the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom progress simultaneously. However, when the Lord Jesus comes back, the reality of the kingdom will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom, and the appearance of the kingdom will be burned away. The Lord&rsquo;s angels will bind the tares into bundles and cast them into the fire (Matt. 13:40-42) because the tares have done much damage to the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore, at His coming back, the Lord will deal first with the appearance of the kingdom, and then He will transfer the reality of the kingdom into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<p>At this point I would ask you to refer to the chart in message two hundred forty, paying attention to the fourth and fifth circles. In the innermost section of the fourth circle is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This circle is enclosed by another, larger circle, which represents the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will bind the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens and cast it into the fire, thus terminating the appearance of the kingdom. Whereas the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will be terminated, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will be transferred into the next circle, the millennium. After being transferred there, the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Kingdom of the Father,<br />
the Heavenly Part of the Millennium</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom will be the kingdom of the Father, the heavenly part of the millennium. The millennium will have an earthly part and a heavenly part. The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah (2 Sam. 7:13), the tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15). The heavenly part of the millennium will be the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 13:43). This will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. In the millennium the overcomers in the heavenly part of the kingdom will reign with Christ over the earthly part, which will be the restored kingdom of David, where Christ as the Son of Man, David&rsquo;s royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) A Reward to the Overcoming Saints</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be a reward to the overcoming saints. Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:18). The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of our Father (Matt. 13:43), the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 26:29), the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. The heavenly kingdom in 2 Timothy 4:18 equals the crown of righteousness in 4:8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) Existing in the Millennium<br />
during the Age of the Millennium</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will exist in the millennium during the age of the millennium. Whereas the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is with the church in this age, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be in the coming age.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="msg">(5)</h1>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens should be an incentive to our Christian life and an exercise to our church life. If the kingdom of the heavens is our incentive and exercise today, then in the coming age it will be a reward to us. Therefore, the kingdom of the heavens is an exercise in this age and a reward in the coming age.</p>
<p>This truth is very much lacking among today&rsquo;s Christians. Hardly anyone is willing to pay the price to take up this truth and to teach it to others. For this reason, we should be burdened to take care of this matter, first being exercised by the kingdom of the heavens in this age so that we may receive it as a reward in the future and then carrying out the burden to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth according to Matthew 24:14. In order to help us realize the kingdom of the heavens as an incentive and exercise, we need to see further aspects of the kingdom, all of which are related to the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s Love</h2>
<p>Paul tells us that the Father has &ldquo;delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love&rdquo; (Col. 1:13). The authority of darkness denotes the authority of Satan. God is light, and Satan is darkness. God has delivered us out of Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness into God&rsquo;s marvelous light. Darkness is Satan as death, but light is God as life. To be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the Devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14; John 17:15). We have been delivered from the Devil, Satan, by the death of Christ (Col. 2:14-15) and by the life of Christ in resurrection (John 5:24).</p>
<p>We have not only been delivered out of the authority of darkness but also transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ (Rev. 11:15; 12:10).</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, the Son of God is the expression of the divine life and its embodiment. This means that the kingdom of the Son is a realm of life. The fact that the kingdom into which we have been transferred is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love indicates that this realm of life is in love, not in fear. The kingdom in which we find ourselves today is a realm full of life, light, and love.</p>
<p>The Son of the Father is the expression of the Father as the source of life (John 1:18, 4; 1 John 1:2). The Father as the source of life is expressed in the Son. The Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love to be the embodiment of life to us in the divine love with the authority in resurrection. The Son, as the embodiment of the divine life, is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love. The divine life embodied in the Son is given to us in the divine love. Therefore, the object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection. This is the kingdom of the Son of His love.</p>
<p>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us (1 John 5:12). The Son in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 6:4-5) is now the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He rules us in His resurrection life with love. This is the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love. When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>We have been transferred into a realm where we are ruled in love with life. Here, under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light. This is what it means to be delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love. Here in this kingdom we enjoy Christ and have the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Comprising the Church in the Present Age,<br />
the Millennium in the Coming Age,<br />
and the New Heaven and New Earth in Eternity</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love comprises three ages: the present age, in which the church is; the coming age, in which the millennial kingdom will be; and the eternal age with the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. These three aspects of the kingdom are considered by Paul in Colossians 1:13 as the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;the Son of God&rdquo; are a delight to the Father&rsquo;s ears. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Father declared, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight&rdquo; (Matt. 3:17). When the Lord was transfigured, the Father made the same declaration (Matt. 17:5). Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight. This is the reason it comprises only three sections&mdash;the section of the church life, the section of the heavenly part of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium, and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the consummation of the church and the kingdom. In each of these three sections the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love is a matter of delight. The Father, by His mercy and grace, has transferred us out of the darkness of Satan into this pleasant part of the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Stress in Colossians 1:13<br />
Is the Kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s Love<br />
in This Age, Which Is the Reality of the Church</h2>
<p>The stress in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love in this age, which is the reality of the church. The church life today is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love which is as delightful to God the Father as the Son of God is. We, the believers, all have been transferred into this delightful kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. God the Father loves the delightful part of the kingdom just as He loves His delightful Son as His own. So, the church, as the delightful part of the divine kingdom, is considered a great blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed people by the Apostle Paul in the book of Colossians, a book which is on Christ as the all-inclusive portion of God&rsquo;s people (Col. 1:12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. All the Believers Have Been Transferred<br />
into This Aspect of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>John 3:5 indicates that it is through regeneration that all the believers have been transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. Through regeneration we have been brought out of the darkness of Satan into this delightful aspect of the kingdom. God loved the Son, so He gave this part of the kingdom to Him. Through God&rsquo;s salvation and regeneration, all the believers of His Son have been transferred into this section of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Kingdom of Christ and of God,<br />
the Kingdom of Our Lord and of His Christ,<br />
and the Eternal Kingdom of Our Lord<br />
and Savior Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:5 speaks of the kingdom of Christ and of God. The kingdom of Christ is the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 16:28); it is also the kingdom of God (Matt. 13:41, 43). The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:5) and are, in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today (Rom. 14:17). Not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcoming ones will. The unclean, defeated ones will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.</p>
<p>In the aspect of the kingdom as the kingdom of Christ and of God, Christ reigns with God. We may also say that Christ reigns as God. Hence, it is the kingdom of Christ and at the same time also the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.&rdquo; The kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of Christ at His coming back after His judgment upon the nations (Dan. 7:13-14; 2:44-45). That the Lord &ldquo;shall reign forever and ever&rdquo; refers to the Lord&rsquo;s reign for eternity in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 22:5).</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:11 speaks of &ldquo;the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The eternal kingdom here refers to the kingdom of God given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (Dan. 7:13-14), which will be manifested at His coming back (Luke 19:11-12). It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature so that they may participate, in the millennium, in His kingship in God&rsquo;s glory (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6). To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God&rsquo;s eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ (1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. All Being the Same One Aspect<br />
of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>The kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&mdash;all three are the same one aspect of the kingdom, the aspect which concerns Christ&rsquo;s relationship with the kingdom of God. Christ has redeemed the church with His blood through His death that it may become the kingdom of God in the church (Rom. 14:17) and the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ in the millennium (Rev. 11:15). This kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ will become the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in which He shall reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Comprising the Millennium in the Coming Age<br />
and the New Heaven and New Earth in Eternity</h2>
<p>The kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ comprise the millennium in the coming age and the new heaven and new earth in eternity; they do not comprise the church age. For this reason, this aspect of the kingdom is not as much a delight to God as the kingdom of the Son of His love, because this aspect of the kingdom refers mainly to God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Received by Christ from God<br />
and Brought in by Christ&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p>The kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is the kingdom received by Christ from God and brought back by Christ&rsquo;s coming (Luke 19:12, 15a; Dan. 7:13-14; 2:34-35, 44; Heb. 1:8). In the parable recorded in Luke 19:11-27, the Lord Jesus speaks of a &ldquo;certain man of noble birth&rdquo; who &ldquo;went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.&rdquo; The man of noble birth here signifies the Savior with the highest status, the status of the God-man. The word &ldquo;went&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s going to heaven after His death and resurrection (Luke 24:51; 1 Pet. 3:22), and &ldquo;return&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s coming back with the kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 2 Tim. 4:1). Daniel 7:13-14 and 2:34-35, 44 refer to the same kingdom. Furthermore, Hebrews 1:8 says that Christ&rsquo;s kingdom is forever. The kingdom referred to in all these verses is the kingdom where Christ will exercise the authority given to Him by the Father. Hence, it is the kingdom of Christ. However, it is also the kingdom of God because Christ receives the kingdom from God to be exercised on earth for God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Kingdom of the Father</h2>
<p>In Matthew 26:29 the Lord Jesus refers to the kingdom of the Father. &ldquo;I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s kingdom is the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, in which the Lord will drink with us after His coming back.</p>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s kingdom is the most pleasant, the most delightful, and the most lovable section of the kingdom. This most pleasant, delightful, and lovable section the Father keeps for Himself. For this reason, this part of the kingdom is called the kingdom of the Father.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:43a the Lord says, &ldquo;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the kingdom of the Father will be the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. In the millennium the overcomers in the heavenly part of the kingdom will reign with Christ over the earthly part.</p>
<p>The overcomers as the righteous, the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38), will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. We are sons of God the Father, and God is light (1 John 1:5; 1 Tim. 6:16). The divine light, which is God Himself, is, of course, much greater than the light of the sun. When in the millennium the overcoming believers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</p>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s kingdom will be the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The reality is here today. In the coming age this reality will be manifested, and that manifestation will be the Father&rsquo;s kingdom as the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom. This is not a matter of power or authority but a matter of the full expression of the Father&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The requirements of the kingdom of the heavens are the highest requirements, requirements that need the highest life, the life of the Father. Because only the Father&rsquo;s life can fulfill the requirements of the kingdom of the heavens, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens can be brought in and realized only by the Father&rsquo;s life. Eventually, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will be manifested. That manifestation will be the Father&rsquo;s kingdom, that section of the kingdom which is most pleasant to the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Kingdom of the Son of Man</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Earthly Section of the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the Son of Man is the earthly section of the millennial kingdom. It is the restored nation of Israel (Acts 1:6), the kingdom of David (Mark 11:10; Luke 1:32-33; 2 Sam. 7:12-13), for the saved Jews.</p>
<p>It is significant that in Matthew 13 the Lord reveals the Father&rsquo;s kingdom in verse 43 and His kingdom, the kingdom of the Son of Man, in verse 41. In the latter verse the Lord says, &ldquo;The Son of Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all stumblingblocks and those who do lawlessness.&rdquo; If we compare verses 41 and 43, we shall see that the part of the kingdom reserved by the Son to Himself is not as pleasant as the part reserved for the Father. In the Father&rsquo;s kingdom the righteous will shine as the sun. This shining, the expression of the Father&rsquo;s life, is a very pleasant thing. But the &ldquo;stumblingblocks&rdquo; and &ldquo;those who do lawlessness&rdquo; are not pleasant matters. This indicates that the Son keeps the unpleasant part of the kingdom for Himself, sending His angels to clear away all evil things so that the Father may have the pleasant part of the kingdom. Whereas the shining of the righteous is pleasant, the clearing away of the negative things is unpleasant. The Son, therefore, reserves to Himself the unpleasant part and gives the most pleasant part to the Father. Because the Son of Man comes to clear away all the negative things for the Father, His kingdom, the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, is called the kingdom of the Son of Man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Restored Nation of Israel, the Kingdom<br />
of David, for the Saved Jews</h2>
<p>As the earthly section of the millennial kingdom, the kingdom of the Son of Man will be the restored nation of Israel (Acts 1:6), the kingdom of David (Mark 11:10; Luke 1:32-33; 2 Sam. 7:12-13), for the saved Jews. The saved Jews will be the priests, and the restored nations will be the people. This is the kingdom of the Son of Man, who will manage, rule over, this part of the millennium. This earthly part of the millennium will be under the heavenly part, the royal part. The manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will include the royalty, the co-kings, reigning over the earth, on which there will be the saved Jews as the priests and the restored nations as the people. This earthly part of the millennium, including the restored nation of Israel and the restored nations, will be the kingdom of the Son of Man.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover two further aspects of the kingdom: the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world and the millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Kingdom Prepared<br />
from the Foundation of the World</h2>
<p>After the Lord Jesus comes back, He will judge all the nations, all the Gentiles who will be left after the Lord destroys those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon. To those on His right hand, who are regarded as sheep, the Lord will say, &ldquo;Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (Matt. 25:34). This aspect of the kingdom was prepared not <em>before</em> the foundation of the world but <em>from</em> the foundation of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Earthly Section of the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>After the judgment at Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory, the sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people on the earth under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). In this way, they will inherit the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>In the millennium there will be three realms: the first will be the realm of the earth, where the blessing of God&rsquo;s creation, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30, will take place; the second, the realm of the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in which the saved Jews will rule over the earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and the third, the heavenly and spiritual realm (1 Cor. 15:50-52), where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (Matt. 5:20; 7:21). The kingdom that the sheep will enter will be the first realm. The blessing of the first realm in the millennium, the blessing of God&rsquo;s creation, was prepared for the sheep from the foundation of the world, whereas the blessing in the third realm, the blessing of the heavenly and spiritual kingdom, was ordained for the believers before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. For the Restored Nations to Dwell In<br />
to Be the People in the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>During the persecution under Antichrist, for the care of the believers and the Jews&mdash;God&rsquo;s chosen people who will be left on earth&mdash;an eternal gospel will be preached to the nations (Rev. 14:6-7), as illustrated by the parable of the net in Matthew 13:47-50. The Lord will then judge the nations not according to the law of Moses nor according to the gospel of Christ but according to the eternal gospel. This is a matter of God&rsquo;s dispensation. Those who listen to that gospel and treat the suffering believers and Jews well will be blessed and reckoned as righteous (Matt. 25:46) to inherit the kingdom (v. 34), but those who do not will be cursed (v. 41) and will perish for eternity. The gospel of grace (Acts 20:24) brings eternal life into the believers (John 3:15-16) that they may live by God&rsquo;s life, whereas the eternal gospel brings the sheep into eternal life (Matt. 25:46) that they may live in the sphere of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>In the kingdom of God as the sphere of God&rsquo;s administration, there is the need for three kinds of people: the priests, the kings, and the people or the nations. The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world is for the restored nations to dwell in to be the people in the millennial kingdom.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">H. The Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>After the Lord Jesus deals with the believers, the Jews, and the nations, He will bring in the millennial kingdom. The word &ldquo;millennium&rdquo; means one thousand years. The kingdom of the Lord on earth will be for one thousand years. The millennium, then, refers to the time after Christ comes again as King to rule the world and before the new heaven and new earth. In the Old Testament there are many verses concerning the millennial kingdom (Psa. 2:6, 8-9; Isa. 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 65:20-25; 30:26; Zech. 8:20-23; Psa. 72:1-17; Isa. 4:2-6; 9:7; 12:1-5; 16:5; 32:1-2; 40:9-11; 61:4-9; Zech. 14:16-21). In the New Testament the millennium is referred to in Revelation 20:4 and 6, verses that speak of those who reign with Christ a thousand years.</p>
<p>Acts 3:21, another verse that refers to the millennium, says, &ldquo;Whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old.&rdquo; This restoration will affect not only man but also the entire creation&mdash;the heavens, the earth, the animals, and even the trees. Everything that was cursed through the fall of man will be restored. Isaiah 30:26 says, &ldquo;Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days.&rdquo; Today the sun and the moon are not normal because they have been cursed through the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. As Genesis 3:17 and 18 indicate, the earth has been cursed because of man&rsquo;s fall. Therefore, the earth today is not normal. But at the time of the restoration of all things, the earth will be restored to its original condition. Furthermore, the beast and the cattle will be restored to such an extent that &ldquo;the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid&rdquo; (Isa. 11:6). This will not be miraculous but rather will be normal and common.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Last Age in God&rsquo;s Old Creation</h2>
<p>The millennium will be the last age in God&rsquo;s old creation. In order to understand this properly, we need to realize that the universe is composed of three periods. The first period was the time before Adam, the pre-Adamic age. No one can tell how long that period of time was. The second period of the universe extends from Genesis 1:2 through the end of the coming millennium. Following this second period, there will be the third period of the universe&mdash;the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem&mdash;which will last for eternity.</p>
<p>The second period of the universe is the period of accomplishment, the time during which God accomplishes His eternal purpose. The period of accomplishment began with the creation of man. The second coming of the Lord Jesus will not end this period of accomplishment, because the old heaven and old earth will continue for another thousand years after the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Those one thousand years will be a continuation of the period of accomplishment. The Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be even a further step in the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, God&rsquo;s accomplishment of His purpose began with the creation of man and will be completed not at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming but at the end of the millennium.</p>
<p>The millennium will be the last and most crucial part of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. We need to stress this point strongly because throughout the centuries many Christian teachers have held the concept that when the Lord Jesus comes back everything will already be completed. According to this concept, the Lord&rsquo;s coming back apparently means the end of the old universe and the beginning of the new heaven and the new earth, for a wonderful period of time, the millennium, will begin. But no matter how wonderful the millennium will be, during that time the old heaven and the old earth will remain in existence. At most, the millennium will be a time of restoration. The old heaven and old earth will be restored during the millennium, but they will not yet be changed from the old to the new. The changing of the old heaven and earth into the new heaven and earth will require another thousand years. Hence, the period of time from the creation of Adam until the second coming of Christ will issue in the restoration of the universe, but it will not result in the renewal of the universe. That will require another thousand years. After the last thousand years have passed, the entire universe will be changed from the old to the new. Then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We should not hold on to the concept that at the time of Christ&rsquo;s coming back everything will be all right. Not everything will be all right at that time. Although Satan will be bound, he will not be fully dealt with during the millennium. At the end of the millennium, he will be loosed from his prison, he will deceive the nations, and he will lead them in battle against the Lord (Rev. 20:7-9). At the end of the millennium, Satan will still work against God. Furthermore, the evil in human nature will not be completely dealt with during the millennium. Although all the nations will be subdued, at the end of that time Gog and Magog will rebel once again, proving that the element of rebellion in man will still be present. Third, death, the last enemy (1 Cor. 15:26), will not be cast into the lake of fire at the second coming of Christ but at the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:14). Thus, three evil things&mdash;Satan, the rebellious nature of man, and death&mdash;will still exist even at the end of the millennium. This indicates that the millennium will be the last age in God&rsquo;s old creation, a time during which the Lord will work to eliminate these three evil things from God&rsquo;s eternal universe.</p>
<p>The chart in message two hundred forty includes eternity in the past and eternity in the future. Between the two ends of eternity there are four circles indicating the dispensation before law, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of the kingdom. All these dispensations, including that of the millennium, belong not to God&rsquo;s new creation but to His old creation. The old creation is used by God to prepare the three kinds of people He needs: the church overcomers to be the kings in the millennium, the saved Israelites to be the priests in the millennium, and the restored nations to be the people in the millennium. During the dispensation of the millennium, God will continue to perfect the believers who were not willing to cooperate with God&rsquo;s sufficient grace to be perfected during the church age. Because they have died without being perfected, God will perfect them in the coming age of the millennium, an age that will still be in the old creation.</p>
<p>During the age of the millennium, God will also purify the restored nations. After they have been purified, they will be qualified to become God&rsquo;s people, but not His sons, in the new earth. Therefore, the millennial age will still be used by God as an age of preparation. During this age He will perfect the saints who have not been perfected during the age of the church so that they may be qualified to enter into the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom. During the millennium, God will also purify the restored nations to be the people on the new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Kingdom Received by Christ<br />
from God the Father</h2>
<p>Luke 19:12 and 15a indicate that the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom received by Christ from God the Father. It comprises the kingdom of Messiah, which is the expectation of many devoted Israelites from the Old Testament to the time when Christ will come back to restore the nation of Israel, and the kingdom of Christ (Eph. 5:5), which is the expectation of the seeking believers in the New Testament age. Hence, it will fulfill the desire of God, of the devoted Israelites, and of the believers in the coming age of one thousand years, which will be the last age of God&rsquo;s old creation.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Its Two Sections</h2>
<p>The millennial kingdom will have two sections&mdash;the heavenly section and the earthly section.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Its Heavenly Section</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Kingdom of the Father</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom of the Father. Matthew 13:43 says, &ldquo;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; The kingdom of the Father, as the heavenly part of the millennium, will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Composed of All the Old Testament<br />
and New Testament Overcomers</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 8:11. &ldquo;I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This refers to the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. It will be in the manifestation of the kingdom that the overcoming Gentile believers will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the other Old Testament overcomers. As the overcomers participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, they will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord (Matt. 26:29).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) As the New Jerusalem in the Millennial Age</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will actually be the New Jerusalem in the millennial age. In Revelation 3:12 the Lord says, &ldquo;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; Here we see that the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God. This promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the overcomer. All the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers will be gathered together to be the New Jerusalem on a smaller scale in the millennium. As those who compose the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom, they will also compose the New Jerusalem in the coming age of the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) As a Reward to All<br />
the Old Testament and New Testament Overcomers</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be a reward to all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers (Heb. 11:26, 39-40). Hebrews 11:26 tells us, for example, that Moses esteemed &ldquo;the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked away to the reward.&rdquo; Because he was willing to suffer the reproach of the Christ, Moses will receive the reward of the kingdom. This reward will be given to all the Old and New Testament overcomers, including Enoch, Abraham, David, and Paul. Whether or not we shall receive this reward depends on our enjoyment, experience, and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God. If we enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and express Christ, we shall be among the overcomers receiving the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom as a reward.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) The Realm for Christ and the Overcomers<br />
to Reign over the Nations<br />
and for the Overcomers to Be Priests<br />
of God and of Christ for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for Christ and the overcomers to reign over the nations and for the overcomers to be priests of God and of Christ for one thousand years. The overcoming believers will reign there with Christ. Revelation 20:4b says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&rdquo; Furthermore, the overcoming believers will rule over the nations. &ldquo;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father&rdquo; (Rev. 2:26-27). This is a reward to the overcomers of reigning with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom. The overcomers will also be priests of Christ and of God. Revelation 20:6b says that the overcomers &ldquo;shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.&rdquo; The overcomers, therefore, will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium. As priests they will bring man in his need to God and minister God to man, and as kings they will bring God in His authority to man and represent God to shepherd man. Hence, the heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the exercise of this priesthood and kingship.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Its Earthly Section</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Restored Kingdom<br />
of Israel&mdash;the Kingdom of David</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the restored kingdom of Israel&mdash;the kingdom of David (Acts 1:6; Mark 11:10). In the Old Testament the Lord promised the Jewish people that the Messiah, the anointed One, would come to inherit the throne of David and restore the Jewish nation, that is, the nation of Israel (Gen. 49:10; 2 Sam. 7:13, 16; Psa. 2:8-9; 72:1-20; 89:4; 110:2-3; Isa. 9:6-7; 11:1-5, 10; Jer. 23:5-6; 30:9; 33:14-17; Ezek. 21:27; 34:23-24; 37:24, 28; Dan. 2:35; 7:14; Hosea 3:5; Amos 9:11-12; Zech. 3:8; 6:12-13; 9:9-10). When the Lord Jesus came the first time, the Jews were expecting the Messiah to restore His kingdom (Luke 2:25; 3:15; 7:19; John 1:41; 7:27, 41). However, it will not be until the Lord&rsquo;s coming back that He will restore the Messianic kingdom (Matt. 23:39). The kingdom which the Lord, the Messiah, will restore&mdash;the kingdom of Messiah or the kingdom of Israel to be restored in the future&mdash;will be the earthly part of the millennium, the tabernacle of David which the Lord will rebuild (Acts 15:16). The Lord will sit on the throne of David and reign over the house of Jacob (the Jewish people, Luke 1:32-33), ruling over the nations of the earth during the millennium (Psa. 2:8; 72:8; Dan. 7:14; 2:35).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) The Realm for the Saved Jews<br />
to Be God&rsquo;s Priests to Teach the Nations in the Millennium</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the saved Jews to be God&rsquo;s priests to teach the nations (Zech. 8:20-23). Zechariah 8:23 says, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo; This verse indicates that during the millennium every Jew will be a priest. Among the ancient Jews, the priests were the minority among the people of God. The people received teaching and instruction concerning God from the priests. They taught the people how to worship and serve God. That was a picture of the future situation in the earthly section of the coming millennial kingdom. During the millennium the Gentiles will take the converted Jews as priests. Ten Gentiles will come to one Jew, asking him to teach them how to serve the Lord. Because they will hear that the Lord is with the Jews, they will come to learn how to serve the Lord. This means that, during the millennium, the Gentiles will be the nations and the converted Jews will be the priests, teaching them to worship God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) The Kingdom Prepared from the Foundation<br />
of the World for the Restored Nations in the Millennium</h2>
<p>We have seen that in Matthew 25:34 the Lord reveals that the restored nations will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. This kingdom will be the earthly section of the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) The Realm for the Restored Nations<br />
to Be God&rsquo;s People in the Millennium</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the restored nations to be God&rsquo;s people. The converted Israelites will be the priests leading the people to worship God. Around the Jews within the earthly section of the millennium will be the preserved, restored, and restituted nations. Therefore, in the earthly section of the millennial kingdom, the converted Jews will be the priests, and the nations who will be restituted, restored, and preserved will be the people. Creation will be restored, there will be no more war, and the earth will be full of peace. What a marvelous and glorious kingdom that will be!</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Kingdom Delivered Back to God<br />
the Father at the End of the Old Creation</h2>
<p>At the end of the old creation, the kingdom will be delivered back to God the Father (1 Cor. 15:24-26). After the Lord has finished the work of purifying the restored nations and of perfecting all the believers during the dispensation of the millennium, He will return the kingdom which He received from the Father, to the Father. This will be the close of the old creation. Then the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come in. The restored and purified nations will be around the New Jerusalem as the people, and the New Jerusalem will be the eternal kingdom of God for God&rsquo;s manifestation and for our eternal enjoyment and experience.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:24 says, &ldquo;Then the end, whenever He delivers up the kingdom to God, even the Father; whenever He annuls all rule and all authority and power.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;end&rdquo; here actually means completion. This verse refers to the end of all the ages and dispensations of the old creation. The end will not occur at the completion of the church age but at the completion of the millennium. Then there will be eternity with the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
<p>In verse 24 the word &ldquo;whenever&rdquo; is significant. It points to the time when Christ annuls satanic authority, subdues all His enemies (v. 25), abolishes death (v. 26), and delivers up the kingdom to God the Father; that is, when all the negative things are done away with and the entire purpose of God is fulfilled, the old creation will come to its end.</p>
<p>At Christ&rsquo;s coming back, He will bring the kingdom of God to earth. Then for a thousand years He will execute the kingdom. Then, at the end of the millennium, the Lord will deliver up the kingdom to God.</p>
<p>After accomplishing redemption, Christ went to receive the kingdom from the Father (Luke 19:12, 15). Before the millennium, He as the Son of Man will have received the kingdom from God, the Ancient of days, to rule all the nations for one thousand years (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 20:4, 6). At the end of the millennium, after the Lord has defeated Satan, the Devil, and his evil angels (as all rule, authority, and power) and even death and Hades, putting all enemies under His feet and casting all of them, including death and Hades, into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10, 14), He will deliver the kingdom back to God the Father.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:25 Paul says of Christ, &ldquo;For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.&rdquo; The longer Christ reigns, the more enemies are put under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ. The word &ldquo;until&rdquo; indicates this and points to the end of the thousand years. That will be the time when every enemy has been put under Christ&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>In verse 26 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;The last enemy that is being abolished is death.&rdquo; Immediately after the fall of man, God began His work to abolish sin and death. This work has been progressing through the Old and New Testament ages and is still in progress today. When sin is done away with at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire, death will be abolished. It also will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). When this last enemy has been abolished, Christ will deliver the kingdom back to God the Father.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover a further aspect of the kingdom of God. Before we go on to see the new heaven and the new earth, we shall consider God&rsquo;s governmental judgment upon His rebellious creatures. Then in the next message we shall begin to consider the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* God&rsquo;s Governmental Judgment<br />
upon His Rebellious Creatures</h2>
<p>The millennial kingdom and the new heaven and new earth are two positive aspects of the kingdom. As an insertion between these aspects, we need to consider a negative aspect&mdash;God&rsquo;s governmental judgment upon His rebellious creatures.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s government is universal; that is, it covers the whole universe. The means by which God carries out His government is His judgment. God governs by judging. Hence, His judgment is governmental. Eventually, after God&rsquo;s governmental judgment has been completed, there will be a new heaven and new earth wherein righteousness dwells (2 Pet. 3:13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Consummated in the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s governmental judgments will consummate in the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the &ldquo;trash can&rdquo; for the entire universe, into which all negative things will be cast. Eventually, all negative things, that is, all the things that have been judged by God, will be swept into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>In the old heaven and old earth there was the sea of water to contain the result of God&rsquo;s judgment, whereas in the new heaven and new earth there will be the lake of fire to replace it. All negative and filthy things, after being judged by God, will be in the lake of fire for eternity. According to Revelation 22:15, the lake of fire will be outside the New Jerusalem, just as Tophet, where the filthy things were (Jer. 19:11-13), was outside the old Jerusalem (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Upon Antichrist and His False Prophet</h2>
<p>At the time of His coming back, Christ and the overcoming saints, the faithful ones, will fight against Antichrist and his false prophet and defeat them, executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon them. Revelation 19:20 says, &ldquo;The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who in his presence had done the signs, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worship his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.&rdquo; Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first cast into the lake of fire (cf. 20:10, 15). They will be cast alive into the lake of fire without passing through death like all the others who perish.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Upon the Condemned Nations</h2>
<p>Another aspect of God&rsquo;s governmental judgment is His judgment upon the condemned nations. This judgment will be carried out by Christ at His throne of glory (Matt. 25:31-46). After He defeats Antichrist and his army, many of the Gentiles will still be living on earth. The Lord will gather them to Himself and judge them. Matthew 25:31 and 32 say, &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory; and all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&rdquo; &ldquo;All the nations&rdquo; are all the Gentiles who will be left at Christ&rsquo;s coming back to earth after He destroys those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). Those that are regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). Those that are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, &ldquo;into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels&rdquo; (Matt. 25:41). The &ldquo;fire&rdquo; here is the fire in the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14-15). The &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; the condemned nations, will perish in the lake of fire after Antichrist and the false prophet and before the Devil and the resurrected sinners (Rev. 20:10, 15).</p>
 <p>The lake of fire was prepared for the Devil and his angels, not for man. However, if any man follows the Devil to oppose the Lord, he will share the lake of fire with the Devil and the fallen angels.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Upon Satan the Devil</h2>
<p>At the end of the millennium, Satan will be &ldquo;loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war, whose number is as the sand of the sea&rdquo; (Rev. 20:7-8). However, fire will come down out of heaven and devour them (v. 9). Then Satan will be cast into the lake of fire. Speaking of this as an accomplished fact, Revelation 20:10 says, &ldquo;The Devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.&rdquo; Although the lake of fire has been prepared for the Devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than Satan. After the thousand years, Satan will be thrown into it.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Upon the Demons</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s governmental judgment upon all rebellious creatures will include His judgment of the demons. Revelation 20:13, a verse related to the judgment at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15), indicates this. &ldquo;The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged everyone according to their works.&rdquo; Since the dead unbelievers who were drowned in the sea are included among those in Hades, the dead given up by the sea must be another category of beings. They should be the spirits of the living beings of the pre-Adamic age, the demons in this age (Matt. 8:31-32; 12:43). In Message Two of the Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that in the pre-Adamic age there were some living beings with spirits. After God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan and those who followed him in his rebellion, these beings became demons, and the sea became their dwelling place. For this reason, the demons caused the swine to rush into the sea (Matt. 8:31-32). Therefore, the sea will give up all the demons, who will then be judged at the great white throne.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Upon All the Sinners, Including Those<br />
Who Worship Antichrist and His Image</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:12 says, &ldquo;I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the books, according to their works.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;standing&rdquo; here indicates that the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of the dead unbelievers, the resurrection of judgment, after the millennium (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23-24). The unbelieving dead will be judged according to the things written in the books, which are the record of the works, the deeds, of the unbelievers. The other book that is open, the book of life, is the record of the names of the believers (Rev. 13:8; 17:8; Luke 10:20). All that the unbelievers have said and done is written in the books, and the unbelievers will be judged according to the things written.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:15 tells us, &ldquo;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.&rdquo; The perishing unbelievers will be judged according to the books, which are a record of their works, but they will be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life. This indicates that they will be condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds, but they will perish because of their unbelief, not having their names written in the book of life. Not believing in the Lord is the unique sin that causes people to perish (John 16:9).</p>
<p>The lake of fire has been prepared for the Devil and his angels. Since the unbelievers follow the Devil, they share the Devil&rsquo;s judgment (John 16:11) and will become joint-partakers of the Devil&rsquo;s eternal torment. The demons, also having followed the Devil, will share the same destiny.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:8 says, &ldquo;The fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part shall be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&rdquo; Here we have eight categories of people who will perish in the lake of fire, the second death.</p>
<p>Due to the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once (Heb. 9:27). This first death, however, is not the final settlement. All the dead will be resurrected and pass through the judgment of the great white throne at the close of the millennium, that is, at the conclusion of the old heaven and old earth, except those who through faith in the Lord Jesus have been recorded in the book of life. As a result of this judgment, they will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, the second death is God&rsquo;s dealing with man after man&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>Referring to the New Jerusalem, Revelation 22:15 says, &ldquo;Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and makes a lie.&rdquo; &ldquo;Outside&rdquo; means outside the city, where the lake of fire keeps all the perished sinners. All the filthy, sinful persons will be cast into the lake of fire, the universal &ldquo;trash can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Revelation 14:9-11 says, &ldquo;Another, a third angel, followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&rdquo; These verses speak of the judgment executed upon those who, during the great tribulation, refuse to obey the eternal gospel, which will be preached by an angel (v. 7). Instead of fearing God and worshipping Him, they will worship Antichrist and his image. As a result, they will be tormented in fire and brimstone. The fire and brimstone mentioned in verse 10 refer to the fire and brimstone in the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14). Those who worship the beast and his image and receive the mark of his name will be eternally tormented and have no rest day and night.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to say a word concerning the relationship between Revelation 14:9-11 and Matthew 25:41, both of which refer to the judgment to be executed upon the nations after the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. At the end of the church age, Antichrist will rise up to be the last Caesar of the kingdom of the restored Roman Empire. He will pretend to be kind toward the Jews and will make a covenant with them for seven years (the last of the seventy weeks spoken of in Daniel 9:24-27), promising them the freedom to worship God. However, after three and a half years, he will break this covenant and begin to persecute the Jews and the Christians. He will seek to destroy any kind of religion, he will set himself up as the unique object of worship (2 Thes. 2:4), and he will compel everyone to worship him. This will mark the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which will be the last three and a half years of this age.</p>
<p>During the great tribulation, an angel will preach the eternal gospel (Rev. 14:6-7), warning people to fear God and worship Him and not to follow Antichrist nor to worship him or his image. The people will also be warned not to persecute God&rsquo;s two peoples&mdash;the Jews and the Christians. The eternal gospel, which will be preached by an angel, is different from the gospel of grace, which we are preaching today. The gospel of grace tells people to repent and to receive Christ, whereas the eternal gospel tells people to fear God and worship Him and not to follow Antichrist. Many will obey this gospel. They will not worship Antichrist or his image, and they will help the persecuted Jews and Christians, the Lord&rsquo;s brothers (Matt. 25:34-40). Others, however, will follow Antichrist. Those who are part of his armies will be destroyed when the Lord with His army of overcomers comes to fight against Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 19:19-21). After the Lord casts Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire, He will sit on His throne of glory in Jerusalem and judge the nations (Matt. 25:31-32) according to the eternal gospel. The &ldquo;sheep,&rdquo; those who obeyed the eternal gospel, will enter into the millennial kingdom to be the nations as its people. The &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; those who did not obey the eternal gospel but followed Antichrist, will perish in the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. For Eternal Perdition to Be<br />
Tormented in Fire and Brimstone Forever</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s governmental judgment upon all His rebellious creatures will be for eternal perdition to be tormented in fire and brimstone forever. Fire burns and brimstone chokes. The lake of fire that burns with brimstone is unquenchable. God&rsquo;s rebellious creatures will perish in the lake of fire, suffering eternal perdition.</p>
<p>In the first death, the soul and the spirit are separated from the body and, in the case of unbelievers, are kept in the suffering section of Hades (Luke 16:22-24). In the second death, the soul and spirit of the unbelievers, after being rejoined to the body in resurrection, will be cast with the body into the lake of fire. This means that an unbeliever&rsquo;s whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;will perish in eternal torment in the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Casting Death and Hades into the Lake of Fire, Which Is the Second Death, Since Death, Hades, and the Lake of Fire Are of the Same Category</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:14 says, &ldquo;Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.&rdquo; Death will be the last enemy destroyed by the Lord (1 Cor. 15:26). Immediately after the fall of man, God began His work to abolish sin and death. This work has been progressing through the Old and New Testament ages and is still in progress today. When sin is done away at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire, death will then be abolished. It will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the great white throne.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;Hades&rdquo; means &ldquo;not to be seen,&rdquo; the invisible, and refers to the subterranean abode of the dead. Hades, the equivalent of Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort (Luke 16:23-26).</p>
<p>Even death and Hades will be judged and cast into the lake of fire because they are two weapons or tools used by the authority of death, Satan, to capture people. God hates them and will put them into the lake of fire, which is the second death. Since death, Hades, and the lake of fire are of the same category, they will be put together by the almighty Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. To Clear Up the Universe<br />
for the New Heaven and New Earth to Come In</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s governmental judgment upon all His rebellious creatures will clear up the universe for the new heaven and new earth to come in. This judgment will be completed by the end of Revelation 20. Therefore, Revelation 21 opens with these words: &ldquo;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.&rdquo; Now that all negative things have been swept by God&rsquo;s judgment into the lake of fire, the way is clear for the new heaven and new earth to appear.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(8)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall begin to consider the last aspect of the kingdom of God&mdash;the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. The New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:1 says, &ldquo;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.&rdquo; Three other verses that speak of the new heaven and new earth are Isaiah 65:17; 66:22; and 2 Peter 3:13. Isaiah 65:17 says, &ldquo;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.&rdquo; Isaiah 66:22 tells us that the new heavens and the new earth which the Lord will make will remain before the eternal God, that is, remain forever. To remain forever means to remain for eternity. Second Peter 3:13 says, &ldquo;According to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.&rdquo; Here we see that righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth. This means that everything will be right, proper, and fitting and that there will be no more friction.</p>
<p>In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression that He might be fully expressed and glorified (Eph. 3:9-11; 1:9-12). For this, He created the heavens, the earth, mankind, and numerous items. Since the creation of man, there have been four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, that is, the dispensation before law, from Adam to Moses (Rom. 5:14); the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ (John 1:17); the dispensation of grace, from Christ&rsquo;s first coming until the &ldquo;restoration of all things&rdquo; at Christ&rsquo;s second coming (Acts 3:20-21); and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ&rsquo;s second coming to the end of the millennium (Rev. 11:15; 20:4, 6). God has used the first three dispensations and will use the fourth to accomplish His purpose by perfecting and completing His chosen people that they may be His eternal corporate expression. All four dispensations belong to the old heaven and old earth. Although the dispensation of the kingdom will be the dispensation of restoration, it will nevertheless take place in the old heaven and old earth because God&rsquo;s perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be fully accomplished until the end of that dispensation. When God finishes this work, by the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), where the New Jerusalem will come for the eternal expression of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>The new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center will be the new universe which God will renew out of the old heaven and old earth. Although the heaven and earth which were created by God have become old because of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the heaven and earth cannot be stopped. On the one hand, God will exercise His almighty power to judge the Satan-corrupted old heaven and old earth; on the other hand, He will renew the judged old heaven and old earth into the new heaven and new earth. Thus, the old heaven and old earth will be rid of their oldness and be renewed into a new universe suitable for God&rsquo;s use to accomplish His eternal purpose and in which He will express Himself eternally and fully.</p>
<p>In relation to the new heaven and new earth, Revelation 21:1 says, &ldquo;The sea is no more.&rdquo; The sea is the result of the waters of judgment, the waters which God used to judge the pre-Adamic world (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). The work of God&rsquo;s re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the waters which were the result of His judgment (Gen. 1:9-10; Jer. 5:22). The living creatures of the pre-Adamic world, after being judged by the waters, became the inhabitants of the sea. After they are dealt with by Christ and His believers (Matt. 8:29-32; Luke 10:17; Acts 16:16-18; 19:12) and the sea has given them up to the judgment of the great white throne (Rev. 20:13), there will be no more need of the sea. From the time of God&rsquo;s work of re-creation, God has intended to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons. Hence, to say, &ldquo;The sea is no more,&rdquo; indicates that Satan and his evil followers have all been dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The First Heaven and First Earth Renewed<br />
through the Judgment of God<br />
by the Purging of the Burning Fire<br />
at the Close of the Old Creation<br />
to Be the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will not be something other than the old heaven and old earth. The new heaven and new earth will be the old heaven and old earth renewed to be the new heaven and new earth through the judgment of God by the purging of the burning fire at the close of the old creation (2 Pet. 3:10b, 12b). This may be compared to our old man and our new man. Today we are a new man but not another man, for the new man is the old man renewed. But whereas we are renewed by the Lord&rsquo;s life, the old heaven and old earth will be renewed by the Lord&rsquo;s judgment with fire. The old universe will be burned, but it will not be burned to nothing; rather, this burning will be a purging, and out of this purging the new heaven and new earth will come forth.</p>
<p>Second Peter 3:10 says, &ldquo;The day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements burning with intense heat will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up.&rdquo; In the day of the Lord, which will come mostly in the sense of judgment, the heavens will pass away with a roar, the elements will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up. This will take place after the millennium (Rev. 20:7, 11). The word &ldquo;roar&rdquo; indicates a rushing sound or noise. This may be a proclamation of a great change in the universe from the old to the new. The &ldquo;elements&rdquo; here are the physical elements of which the heavens are composed.</p>
<p>We may compare the words &ldquo;dissolved&rdquo; and &ldquo;burned up&rdquo; in 2 Peter 3:10 with &ldquo;roll them up&rdquo; and &ldquo;changed&rdquo; in Hebrews 1:12, &ldquo;fled away&rdquo; and &ldquo;no place was found for them&rdquo; in Revelation 20:11, and &ldquo;passed away&rdquo; in Revelation 21:1. The &ldquo;burning with intense heat&rdquo; to dissolve the heavens and the earth will be the procedure God will use to roll up the heavens and the earth and put them away so that they may be changed from the old to the new. This will be God&rsquo;s final and consummate dealing with His creation in His government. In God&rsquo;s final dealing all the material things will pass away, but His eternal word will abide forever (Matt. 24:35; 1 Pet. 1:25). The word of His prophecy will remain and be fulfilled at His appointed time for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, regardless of the changes that occur in the physical universe.</p>
<p>Speaking of the day of God, Peter says, &ldquo;On account of which the heavens, being set on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements burning with intense heat are melted&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:12). The relative pronoun &ldquo;which&rdquo; refers to the coming of the day of God. The coming of the day of God is to execute judgment upon every part of the old creation to clear it up. On account of the coming of such a day, the heavens will no longer be able to stand and remain as they have been, but will be dissolved, their elements melting in the intense heat of the burning fire. Therefore, Peter says that &ldquo;the heavens, being set on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements burning with intense heat are melted.&rdquo; This is for the old heaven and old earth to be renewed to be the new heaven and new earth.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The New Universe as the Realm<br />
of God&rsquo;s Ruling in Eternity</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will be the new universe as the realm of God&rsquo;s ruling in eternity. Hence, it will be the realm for God to administrate His government for eternity, and this divine administration is considered the eternal kingdom of God in which righteousness dwells forever with the New Jerusalem (the composition of all the redeemed of God) as the center.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Issue of God&rsquo;s Work of the New Creation<br />
within the Old Creation and God&rsquo;s Work<br />
of Restoration in the Old Creation</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will be the issue of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation and God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation. Here we see that God has two kinds of work in relation to the new heaven and new earth. First, His work is the work of the new creation within the old creation. This is God&rsquo;s work upon His chosen ones, the believers in Christ. This work involves redemption, calling, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, and conformation. Once we were the old creation, but God is working on us, making us a new creation. This is God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s other kind of work related to the new heaven and new earth is His work of restoration in the old creation. This is God&rsquo;s work to restore the natural nations to be the people, the nations, in the new universe.</p>
<p>Through these two kinds of work, God will have two kinds of peoples. The first kind will be the saints, the regenerated and transformed ones. The second kind, who will not be regenerated and transformed, will be the restored nations, those who are restored to the original state of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God&rsquo;s Work of the New Creation in the Old Creation to Produce the Regenerated, Transformed, and Perfected Saints to Be the Kings and Priests in the Center&mdash;<br />
the New Jerusalem&mdash;of the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation is to produce the regenerated, transformed, and perfected saints to be the kings and priests in the center&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;of the new heaven and new earth. There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation. God&rsquo;s life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature. Although the old creation came into being through the mighty work of God, He Himself does not reside in it. For this reason, the first creation, the old creation, has no divine content. The divine nature does not dwell in the old creation, and that is why it has become old. Adam did not have the life of God or the nature of God. We can receive the divine life and nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit. When we believed in Christ, entering into an organic union with Him, God&rsquo;s life and nature were imparted to us and caused us to become a new creation. Therefore, 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s work in this age, the age of grace, is not the work of creation nor the work of restoration; it is the work of producing the new creation in the old creation. Through redemption, justification, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification God is making the new creation out of the old creation. The age of grace is the age of the new creation. The old creation is merely the creation without God in it. The new creation is the old creation born of God with God as its new element. The old creation, because of the addition of God to it, becomes the new creation. As believers in Christ, who have been born again of God, we have the divine life and the divine nature. Hence, we are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</p>
<p>The work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation. In the coming age, in the millennium, God will neither create nor produce the new creation. Instead, He will restore the old, fallen creation. The work of restoration will not include us, because by that time we shall have already become the new creation. As God&rsquo;s new creation, in the new heaven and new earth we shall be the kings and priests. We shall serve God as priests and we shall reign as kings over the nations.</p><h2 class="head4">b. God&rsquo;s Work of Restoration in the Old Creation<br />
to Produce the Restored Nations to Be the People<br />
on the New Earth around the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth also involves God&rsquo;s work of restoration in the old creation to produce the restored nations to be the people on the new earth around the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:24, 26). At His coming back, the Lord will judge the living. Some of the living ones will then become the people on the new earth during the millennium. At the end of the millennium, some of these people will rebel, and God will judge them (Rev. 20:8-9). The remnant of these living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the people of God, around the New Jerusalem. These nations will be restored and even redeemed, but they will not be regenerated. Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth, God will have both the new creation and the restored part of the old creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. With the New Jerusalem as Its Center</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will have the New Jerusalem as its center (see chart in Message Two Hundred Forty). After the coming forth of the new heaven and new earth, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will descend to the new earth (Rev. 21:1-2). This indicates that the dwelling place of God and His redeemed will not be in heaven but on the new earth. Furthermore, as we have seen, the restored nations, whose rebellious nature will have been completely purged, will become the nations on the new earth around the New Jerusalem. In the new universe, the new heaven and new earth, God&rsquo;s focus will be on the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center.</p>
<p>At the consummation of God&rsquo;s work in the first heaven and first earth, there will be God&rsquo;s new creation with Himself in this new creation as its life and its everything. This new creation will actually be the New Jerusalem, which is a mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people. In eternity future there will also be the restored old creation. The new heaven and new earth will not be another heaven and another earth. Rather, the new heaven and new earth will be the old heaven and old earth restored but not regenerated. The new heaven and new earth and all the nations will be the restored old creation. In the center of this restored old creation will be the new creation, the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Having Righteousness Dwell in It</h2>
<p>&ldquo;According to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:13). The Greek word rendered &ldquo;dwells&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;makes its home.&rdquo; Because the Epistle of 2 Peter is on the government of God, it tells us that there will be a new universe where righteousness will dwell. This indicates that everything will be altogether under God&rsquo;s government. Nothing will be wrong; nothing will be unjust or unrighteous. Thus, there will be no need of any further governmental judgment of God.</p>
<p>Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God&rsquo;s governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His creation. Hence, in the books of 1 and 2 Peter, which are concerned with God&rsquo;s government, this matter is stressed repeatedly (1 Pet. 2:23, 24; 3:12, 14; 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:1; 2:5, 7-8, 21; 3:13). The main thing we see in John&rsquo;s writings is God&rsquo;s love expressed in His life; in Paul&rsquo;s writings, God&rsquo;s grace distributed in His dispensing; and in Peter&rsquo;s writings, God&rsquo;s righteousness maintained in His government. God&rsquo;s life, dispensing, and government are the basic structures of the ministry of these three apostles. Life is of love, dispensing is by grace, and government is based upon righteousness. This righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth, and it will saturate God&rsquo;s new universe prevailingly to maintain it absolutely under God&rsquo;s righteous order, so that there will be no need ever of any further judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Existing for Eternity</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:8; Psalm 145:13; and Daniel 4:3b indicate that the new heaven and new earth will exist for eternity. The new heaven and new earth as the new realm for God&rsquo;s eternal administration will exist for eternity as God Himself is eternal. It will last unto all the generations of the age of the ages without ending to serve the divine purpose for God to carry out His eternal administration for His eternal manifestation and expression in the fullest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Having Years, Months, Days, and Nights<br />
Ruled by the Sun and the Moon</h2>
<p>The new heaven and new earth will have years, months, days, and nights ruled by the sun and the moon (Rev. 22:2; cf. Gen. 1:16-18). The word &ldquo;month&rdquo; in Revelation 22:2 indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months. The sun will also be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each. In the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction (Rev. 21:25; 22:5), for the light in the holy city will be the Triune God Himself (Rev. 21:23).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(9)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover a number of matters related to the people on the new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Its People</h2>
<p>We should not think that in eternity there will be only two categories of people, the saved ones in the New Jerusalem and the perished ones in the lake of fire. There will also be a third category&mdash;the people who are neither in the New Jerusalem nor in the lake of fire but outside the city. These will be the people on the new earth in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Restored Nations</h2>
<p>At the end of this age a great part of the inhabitants of the earth will be killed by the sixth and seventh trumpets (Rev. 9:12-21; 11:14-18). The rest will be judged by Christ at the throne of His glory when He comes back to earth (Matt. 25:31-46). The condemned ones, the &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; will be cursed to perish in the lake of fire (vv. 41-46), whereas the justified ones, the &ldquo;sheep,&rdquo; will be blessed to inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world (vv. 34-40) and will enter into eternal life (v. 46). They will not be saved and regenerated as the New Testament believers; rather, they will only be restored to the original state of man as created by God. They will be the nations as citizens of the millennial kingdom, in which the overcoming believers will be the kings (Rev. 20:4, 6) and the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests (Zech. 8:20-23). After the millennium, a part of these nations, deceived by the Devil, will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven (Rev. 20:7-9). The rest will be transferred to the new earth as the nations, living around the New Jerusalem and walking by its light (21:24). They will be the peoples mentioned in Revelation 21:3 and 4. They, as the created but unregenerated man, will be maintained to live forever in their created state by the healing of the leaves of the tree of life (22:2). Even to them there will be no more death (21:4). Under the shining of the New Jerusalem with the divine glory, neither will they be in darkness.</p>
<p>We need to emphasize the fact that the nations on the new earth in eternity will be restored but not regenerated. The nations will consist of those restored to the original state of man in God&rsquo;s creation, and they will enjoy the blessing of the restoration. But restoration is not regeneration. To be regenerated is to be born again with God&rsquo;s life, but to be restored is to be brought back to the original state of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. As God&rsquo;s People Who Do Not Have God&rsquo;s Life<br />
and Nature, Different from the Sons of God</h2>
<p>We need to have a clear understanding of the difference between the nations as the people of God and the sons of God. As the people of God, the restored nations on the new earth will not have God&rsquo;s life and nature. In this matter they will be different from the sons of God, who do possess the life and nature of God. As those who will be in the New Jerusalem, we shall be the sons of God, not the people of God.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;They shall be His peoples,&rdquo; and verse 4 speaks about the nations. Revelation 21:7 says, &ldquo;He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me.&rdquo; The nations will walk by the light of the holy city, but we, the sons, shall be the holy city. To God, then, His sons are one category and His people are another.</p>
<p>In the new heaven and new earth we shall not be the people, the nations, but the sons. The sons of God in Revelation 21:7 are those who have been born of God through regeneration (John 1:12-13; 1 Pet. 1:3-4, 23; James 1:18). They are built together through transformation (1 Cor. 3:9-12a; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-6; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23-24). They will be glorified in full to be the corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Rom. 8:29-30; Heb. 2:10; Rev. 21:11). The nations outside the New Jerusalem will not be regenerated, transformed, or glorified.</p>
<p>Those who are regenerated, transformed, and glorified will be the components of the New Jerusalem. Today the believers as the members of the Body of Christ are the components of the church, which is both the house of God and the wife of Christ. These components&mdash;the regenerated, transformed, and glorified sons of God to be both the house of God and the wife of Christ (Rev. 21:3, 9)&mdash;in eternity will eat the tree of life and drink the water of life (Rev. 22:14, 17). The people, the restored nations, however, will not have this enjoyment. To them there will be no more death, sorrow, crying, pain, or curse (21:4; 22:3a). They will be sustained eternally by the leaves of the tree of life (22:2). The sons of God will enjoy the fruit, but the people will enjoy the leaves. The people, therefore, will live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem and enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and new earth, whereas the sons of God will dwell in the New Jerusalem, participate in all its enjoyment, serve God and the Lamb (22:3), and reign for eternity (22:5).</p><h2 class="head4">c. Having God with Them, Who Dwells<br />
in the New Jerusalem as the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them.&rdquo; We need to pay attention to the plural noun &ldquo;peoples.&rdquo; We Christians are not God&rsquo;s peoples; we are His sons. The peoples in this verse are not the sons of God but the restored nations. There will be several peoples, and each corporate people will be a nation on the new earth. By that time their rebellious nature will have been purged away. As the purged and restored nations, these peoples will live outside the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In the new heaven and new earth, God will dwell with His peoples, but He will not dwell in them. God will dwell in the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle, and the peoples will be around the New Jerusalem. In this way God will dwell with them.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. God Will Wipe Away Their Tears, and<br />
Death, Sorrow, Crying, and Pain Shall Be No More;<br />
for the Former Things Have Passed Away</h2>
<p>The restored nations will enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and new earth. These blessings are described in Revelation 21:4. &ldquo;He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain&mdash;they shall be no more; for the former things have passed away.&rdquo; In the new heaven and new earth there shall be no tears, no death, no sorrow, no crying, and no pain. Instead, in the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause of tears. Since death will be wholly swallowed up by life (1 Cor. 15:54) and cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14), in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more death. Not only will death itself be cast into the lake of fire, but the elements of death&mdash;sorrow, crying, and pain&mdash;will be abolished.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:3 and 4 speak of the nations, who are the descendants of the sheep in Matthew 25:31-46, whereas verses 5 through 7 refer to the sons of God, all the saints, the divinely saved ones through all the generations. When the sons of God are in the New Jerusalem, they will not have tears and therefore will not experience the wiping away of tears. Instead, the sons of God will have the full enjoyment of eternal life. The restored nations, who will not have the full enjoyment of eternal life, will have their tears wiped away by God. This will be God&rsquo;s blessing to them. We may think that this is an intimate blessing and desire it for ourselves. If this is our desire, we may not be clear about the difference between the blessing of eternal life in the New Jerusalem and the blessing to the peoples on the new earth. We have received eternal life through believing in Christ, but we may not have the proper understanding of what the blessing of this life is and what the real blessing of eternal life will be in the New Jerusalem in eternity. God will not wipe away our tears but will supply us with the water of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Inhabiting the New Earth around the Holy City</h2>
<p>The restored nations will inhabit the new earth around the holy city (Rev. 21:24). In the new heaven and new earth the nations who will be blessed to be the people will inhabit the new earth as their dwelling place around the New Jerusalem, which will be glorified with God&rsquo;s glory and illumined with the divine light as the excellent glory of God in Christ. They will not participate in this divine glory and in this divine light, both of which will be a particular portion for the saints redeemed by Christ&rsquo;s blood and regenerated by God&rsquo;s Spirit. Yet they will enjoy the shining of the divine glory and of the divine light through the redeemed and regenerated saints in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Walking by the Light of the Holy City</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:24a tells us that the peoples on the new earth will walk by the light of the holy city. The glory of God will illumine the New Jerusalem, and its lamp will be the Lamb (Rev. 21:23). For this reason, the city will have no need of the light of a lamp nor of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will illumine it (22:5). The glory of God as the light and the Lamb as the lamp signify that God in Christ will be the light of the New Jerusalem in eternity. In the holy city there will be no need of the sun, the natural light, nor of any man-made lamp because God Himself will be the light and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city. This is the light in which the nations will walk.</p>
<p>In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold (Isa. 30:26). I believe that in the new heaven and new earth the light of the sun will be even brighter than this. Nevertheless, Revelation 21:24 says that the nations will walk in the light of the city. This indicates that the light in the city will be stronger than the natural light. God will shine through the city, and this shining will be brighter than that of either the sun or the moon. Actually, the nations will not need to walk in the sunlight or in the moonlight, for they will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Their Kings Shall Bring Their (the Kings&rsquo;)<br />
Glory into the Holy City</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:24b says, &ldquo;The kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Glory&rdquo; here refers to the choice produce (Gen. 31:1, 16; Esth. 1:4). The kings of the earth here are the kings of the nations on the new earth. On the new earth there will still be kings, but they will be subordinate to the holy city. The fact that the kings will bring their glory into the New Jerusalem indicates that they will be subordinate to the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. The People Shall Bring the Glory<br />
and Honor of the Nations into the Holy City</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:26 tells us, &ldquo;They shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.&rdquo; Once again, glory refers to choice produce, and &ldquo;honor&rdquo; refers to preciousness in condition and dignity in position. The people&rsquo;s bringing the glory and honor of the nations into the holy city indicates that they will be subordinate to the sons of God, who will be reigning as kings in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head4">i. Preserved by the Healing of the Leaves<br />
of the Tree of Life to Exist<br />
in the Created and Restored Human Life Forever</h2>
<p>The nations on the new earth will be preserved by the leaves of the tree of life to exist in the created and restored human life forever. Revelation 22:2b says, &ldquo;The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers will eat of the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as the life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity. The restored nations, on the contrary, will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and direction, that they may live the created and restored human life forever.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM ITS ASPECTS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(10)</h1>
<p>In this message I have the burden to give a further word on the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sons of God and the Restored People</h2>
<p>In the new heaven and new earth there will be the sons of God and the restored people. The sons of God will be regenerated, but the people will simply be restored to the condition of God&rsquo;s original creation according to God&rsquo;s ordained principles. Hence, there will be a distinction between the sons of God and the restored people.</p>
<p>We need to see how the sons of God are produced as the constituents of the New Jerusalem. In the millennium there will still be a difference between the New Jerusalem and the saved remnant of Israel. However, in the new heaven and new earth there will no longer be any difference between Christians and saved Jews. When the Lord Jesus comes back to set up the millennial kingdom, the Jews will be saved but not perfected. For this reason, there will be a difference between the perfected Christians and the saved but unperfected Jews. The Lord will use the millennium to perfect the saved Jews. By the end of the millennium all the saved Jews will have been perfected and will be the same as the perfected Christians. Then all the perfected Jews and Christians will be joined to be one kind of saint who, in the sight of God, will be the race of faith, the descendants of the one father, Abraham. Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth, there will be no distinction between the Christian believers and the saved Jews. Together they will constitute the one, enlarged New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem in the millennium will include neither the unperfected believers nor the saved but unperfected Jews. Those believers who have not been perfected in this age will be perfected during the millennium, perhaps in the outer darkness. God, then, will use two different ways to perfect the defeated Christians and the saved Jews. The defeated Christians will be perfected by what will take place in the outer darkness. God&rsquo;s way to perfect the saved Jews will be to put them during the millennium into the position of priests of God to learn of God and to teach the nations. By these two means both the defeated Christians and the saved Jews will be perfected. Then after the millennium all the perfected Christians and the perfected Jews will be a single entity&mdash;the New Jerusalem. Outside the New Jerusalem will be the restored nations as the people on the new earth.</p>
<p>Many believers and unbelievers alike hold a traditional concept regarding eschatology. According to this traditional concept, there will ultimately be only two results&mdash;heaven or hell. Those who are good will supposedly go to heaven, and those who are evil, to hell. This concept is held not only by Christians but also by Jews, Moslems, and Buddhists. This traditional concept is natural and religious; it is not according to the Scriptures. Because the influence of the traditional concept is so strong, it is crucial for us to see what biblical eschatology is.</p>
<p>We need to consider biblical eschatology in relation to God&rsquo;s kingdom. The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s reign, His rule, and it is eternal, even as God Himself is eternal. Psalm 90:2 tells us that God is eternal: from eternity to eternity He is God. In Psalm 145:13 we are told that God&rsquo;s kingdom likewise is eternal. Because God is eternal, His kingdom, His government, also is eternal.</p>
<p>Between eternity past and eternity future, God&rsquo;s kingdom has four dispensations: the dispensation before law, from Adam to Moses; the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ; the dispensation of grace, from Christ&rsquo;s first coming until His second coming; and the dispensation of the kingdom, which will last a thousand years. After these four dispensations will be eternity future with the new heaven and new earth. The new heaven and new earth is a matter of the final, the consummate, eschatology. The universe will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Jerusalem, the New Earth,<br />
and the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>Three matters concerning the new heaven and new earth deserve careful attention. First, in the new heaven and new earth the most striking and outstanding thing is the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Second, in the last two chapters of Revelation, the emphasis is on the new earth, not on heaven. Actually, these chapters do not say anything about heaven. In the center of the new earth will be the New Jerusalem, which will descend from heaven. Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; This indicates that when the new heaven and new earth appear (v. 1), the New Jerusalem will come down to earth. In a very real sense, God will forsake the heavens and devote His full attention to the earth.</p>
<p>During the millennium the earth will not be altogether lovable, for it will not yet have been thoroughly cleared up. Certain things will be cleared up only at the end of the millennium. When the Lord Jesus comes back, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:1-3). But at the end of the millennium Satan will be released from the abyss, come back to earth, and &ldquo;deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). From this we see that there will be evil on earth even at the end of the millennium. For this reason, the earth will not be pleasing to God, and He will not yet come down from heaven to earth. The old heaven and earth will need purification, and this purification, this purging, will be accomplished by fire (2 Pet. 3:12-13). After the purging of the old heaven and old earth by fire, God will come down to earth and place His beloved New Jerusalem, which will be His eternal dwelling place, in the center of the new earth. On this new earth will be the restored and purified nations, who will enjoy the blessings of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>The third matter related to the new heaven and new earth is the lake of fire. The New Jerusalem will be a city of water, and outside this city, and in contrast to it, will be the lake of fire. If we compare Revelation 22:15 and 21:8, we shall see that the lake of fire will be outside the holy city. Revelation 22:15 says, &ldquo;Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and makes a lie.&rdquo; Revelation 21:8 tells us, &ldquo;The fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part shall be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&rdquo; Taken together, these verses reveal that in the new heaven and new earth outside the New Jerusalem, the city of water, will be the lake of fire, which will be the universal &ldquo;trash can,&rdquo; containing all negative things.</p>
<p>The first ones to be cast into the lake of fire will be Antichrist and his helper, the false prophet. They will follow Satan to the uttermost, and for this reason they will be the first to be cast into the lake of fire, going there ahead of Satan. Eventually, the condemned nations (Matt. 25:41), Satan the Devil (Rev. 20:10), the demons (Rev. 20:13a, 15), and all sinners, including those who worship Antichrist and his image (Rev. 20:13b-15; 21:8; 22:15; 14:9-11), will also be cast into the lake of fire. Finally, even death and Hades will be thrown into the lake of fire, the second death. Therefore, all the &ldquo;trash&rdquo; in the universe will be swept into the lake of fire as the universal trash can.</p>
<p>In the consummation of the eschatology revealed in the Bible, that is, in the new heaven and new earth, there will be a threefold issue. There will be nothing in the heavens, but on the new earth there will be three categories of people. First, there will be the New Jerusalem constituted of the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, perfected, and glorified believers, expressing God&rsquo;s glory and shining over the nations.</p>
<p>Second, around the New Jerusalem will be the restored and purged nations, who will enjoy God&rsquo;s creation. During the millennium, certain of the nations will inherit the kingdom prepared &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (Matt. 25:34). From the time God created the earth, He had the intention to prepare a kingdom for His created people to enjoy His blessing. In eternity future the new earth will be the full enjoyment to God&rsquo;s created and restored people. These people, although fallen, will be purified and restored to the original condition of God&rsquo;s creation to enjoy the new earth.</p>
<p>Third, on the new earth there will also be the lake of fire. All the negative things throughout the four dispensations will be swept into the lake of fire. God&rsquo;s Christ, the anointed One, has been commissioned by God to accomplish this work. After all negative things, including death and Hades, have been dealt with by being cast into the lake of fire, God will clear up, will purge, heaven and earth by fire. By passing through the purging fire, the old heaven and old earth will become the new heaven and new earth. Then God Himself will be happy to come down from the heavens to the earth, something He has been longing to do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Nations Walking in the Light<br />
of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>On the new earth God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people will be the center. They will be God&rsquo;s dwelling place and Christ&rsquo;s counterpart, His bride, the New Jerusalem. Around the New Jerusalem as the center will be the restored and purified nations as the peoples on the new earth enjoying God&rsquo;s blessing in His creation.</p>
<p>In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be the manifestation of God. Within the city God will be the light, and Christ, the Lamb, will be the lamp (Rev. 21:23). The New Jerusalem will be a golden lampstand shining out the Triune God over the nations. All the nations will walk in this light and will bring their glory and honor into the city (21:24, 26). This will be the complete fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 5:16. &ldquo;Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; As the New Jerusalem, a universal, golden lampstand, shines forth the Triune God over the nations, the nations will enjoy this light and bring their glory and honor into the New Jerusalem. This should be the situation with the church today. The shining of the church is a shining by life and with life. The churches today are shining over the Gentiles by life, with life, and in life. This life is the life of the processed and consummated Triune God. The light shining out from the churches is the light of life (John 8:12). As we shine out the light of life over the unbelievers, they may walk in this light, even as the nations on the new earth will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The nations on the new earth will enjoy the shining of the light of life from the Triune God in the New Jerusalem. They will enter into eternal life and they will be under the shining of eternal life, but they will not have eternal life in them. As the nations enjoy the shining of eternal life, they will bring their glory and honor to the shining New Jerusalem. Whereas the nations will enjoy the shining of eternal life, all the negative, rebellious ones will suffer eternal torment in the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Clear Picture of Biblical Eschatology</h2>
<p>My burden in this message has been to present a clear picture of biblical eschatology. The consummation of this eschatology has three elements: the New Jerusalem, the lake of fire, and the new earth between the New Jerusalem and the lake of fire.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is produced by God&rsquo;s redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, perfection, and glorification. In the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy, experience, and express the processed Triune God to the uttermost. Those who are in the New Jerusalem will constitute the first category of beings in the new heaven and new earth. God&rsquo;s work to produce the beings in this category is His work of the new creation in the old creation.</p>
<p>The second category of beings will be the restored and purified nations. They will be produced by God&rsquo;s work of restoration and purification on the old creation.</p>
<p>In addition to these two categories of beings, there will be a third category consisting of all those who have been cast into the lake of fire. Through God&rsquo;s working, all of God&rsquo;s rebellious creatures and all negative things will be swept into the lake of fire. They will remain there for eternity as a testimony of God&rsquo;s righteousness. This is the reason God&rsquo;s righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth. Anyone who does not know God&rsquo;s righteousness should consider the lake of fire. The lake of fire signifies God&rsquo;s righteousness. All of God&rsquo;s rebellious creatures will be punished and tormented in the lake of fire as the expression of God&rsquo;s unlimited righteousness, whereas God&rsquo;s life and glory will be manifested in the new heaven and the new earth, and especially on the new earth, through the New Jerusalem.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,<br />
ITS RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S GLORY,<br />
AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>We have covered the different aspects of the kingdom. In this message and in the messages following, we shall consider the kingdom in its reality, its nature, its expression, its relation to God&rsquo;s glory, and its unshakableness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. ITS REALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ as the Seed of Life</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom is Christ as the seed of life. Christ, the One who is life, has sown Himself as the seed of life into God&rsquo;s chosen ones, who are the soil for growing Him (Mark 4:3, 26). The Lord Jesus came to sow Himself as the seed of life into men&rsquo;s hearts, that He might grow in them and live in them and be expressed from within them. The seed of the kingdom is not a matter of power or authority but of the divine life embodied in Christ. Hence, the seed of the kingdom is a seed of life. This seed of life, which is Christ Himself, is the basic element of the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In Mark 4 we see that the Lord Jesus establishes the kingdom by sowing Himself as the seed of life into God&rsquo;s chosen people, the believers, so that the kingdom may grow. This indicates that the establishment of the kingdom is absolutely a matter of growth in life. To establish the kingdom, therefore, is to grow the kingdom. The kingdom is not established by outward working but by inward growing. If we do not realize this, we may think that the kingdom is established by our work. The kingdom, however, can be established only by Christ&rsquo;s being sown as the seed of life into humanity. Hence, the kingdom is not brought into being by teaching or working; on the contrary, the kingdom is brought into being by Christ&rsquo;s being sown as the kingdom seed into the believers. The seed will grow, and the life within it will produce the kingdom in its reality. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is wholly a matter of life&mdash;Christ Himself as the seed of life, the seed of the kingdom, sown into our being.</p>
<p>In order to make this matter clear, we may use the biological term &ldquo;gene&rdquo; and apply it to Christ as the seed of life, which is the kingdom in its reality. The Christ who has been sown into our being is the gene of the kingdom. We know that without human genes it is impossible to have human life. Our birth, being, and existence all came from a gene. The principle is the same with the kingdom in its reality. Christ has been sown into us to be the gene of the kingdom. Eventually, the kingdom will issue from this gene. It is crucial for us to see that the Christ who has been sown into our hearts is the gene of the kingdom. Christ has been sown into us as a gene, as a seed of life, to grow, develop, and issue in the kingdom.</p>
<p>In Mark 4:26-29 the Lord Jesus tells the parable of the kingdom seed. &ldquo;So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens&mdash;how, he does not know. The earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear&rdquo; (vv. 26-28). The man is the Lord Jesus as the sower. The seed is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into us. This parable reveals that the kingdom of God is a matter of life, the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest. The kingdom is not a matter of lifeless organization through man&rsquo;s wisdom and ability. The kingdom in its reality is a matter of Christ as the seed of life sown into us and growing in us unto maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ&rsquo;s Expansion<br />
as the Enlargement</h2>
<p>The kingdom&rsquo;s reality is also seen in Christ&rsquo;s expansion as the enlargement. Christ&rsquo;s expansion is His growth within us, and His expansion is His enlargement.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:6 tells us that we have been made the kingdom of God. Christ loosed us from our sins by His blood (v. 5) and made us a kingdom. The believers redeemed by the blood of Christ have not only been born of God into His kingdom (John 3:5) but have also been made a kingdom for God&rsquo;s economy, which is the church (Matt. 16:18-19). John, the writer of the book of Revelation, was in the kingdom (Rev. 1:9), and all redeemed and reborn believers are also part of this kingdom (Rom. 14:17).</p>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s kingdom because we are the expansion of Christ, His enlargement. Luke 17:20-21 confirms this. &ldquo;Being questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God comes, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Look, here! Or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is among you.&rdquo; What does it mean to say that the kingdom of God does not come with observation? It means that the kingdom is invisible. The kingdom is something that cannot be observed by our natural ability. In particular, the kingdom cannot be observed by our natural thinking, which is completely useless in apprehending the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is not material but spiritual. As a spiritual reality it can be realized only by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit.</p>
<p>The kingdom in its reality today is the Lord Jesus as the Spirit. In Matthew 12:28 the Lord says, &ldquo;If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.&rdquo; This indicates that the kingdom is the reality of the Spirit of God, which is the reality of Christ. The Spirit is the reality of the Lord Jesus, for the Spirit is His person, and His person is His reality. The kingdom, therefore, is the spiritual realization of the Lord Jesus. When we realize Him spiritually, we have the kingdom in its reality.</p>
<p>In Luke 17:20-21 the Lord reveals that He Himself is the kingdom. As the One who is Himself the kingdom, He enters into His believers and grows in them to have an expansion, an enlargement, and this enlargement is the kingdom in its reality. Therefore, both the seed of the kingdom and the expansion of the kingdom are the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Enlargement<br />
Being the Realm<br />
of the Kingdom&rsquo;s Ruling</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Its entrance is regeneration (John 3:5), and its development is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life (2 Pet. 1:3-11). It is the church today, in which the faithful believers live (Rom. 14:17), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) to the overcoming saints in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life for all God&rsquo;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5).</p>
<p>In eternity the New Jerusalem will be the totality of all the believers shining forth the processed Triune God. The new earth will be a realm in which God will rule over the nations. This ruling realm will be formed by the shining of the New Jerusalem. Hence, the shining of the New Jerusalem will produce a realm for God&rsquo;s ruling. This is the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. ITS NATURE</h2>
<p>Now we come to the nature of the kingdom. We shall use six adjectives to describe the kingdom in its nature: divine, heavenly, spiritual, human, pure, and eternal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Divine&mdash;the Kingdom of <em>God,</em><br />
with the Divine Attributes</h2>
<p>In its nature the kingdom of God (Mark 1:15) is divine, having the divine attributes. The word &ldquo;divine&rdquo; means being of God, having the nature of God, or being transcendent and distinct from all others. Only God has the nature of God, and only God is transcendent and distinct from everything else. Therefore, only God is divine.</p>
<p>The nature of the kingdom is divine because it is the kingdom of <em>God</em> with the divine attributes. Because the kingdom is the kingdom of God, its nature will be the nature of God. Since God is holy, surely His kingdom also will be holy. Likewise, since God is righteous, His kingdom will be righteous as well. God is divine, and the kingdom, being the kingdom of God, will also be divine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Heavenly&mdash;the Kingdom of the <em>Heavens,</em><br />
with the Transcendency of the Heavens</h2>
<p>The kingdom is also heavenly in nature, for it is the kingdom of the <em>heavens</em> (Matt. 3:2), with the transcendency of the heavens. The church today should also be transcendent; there should be a certain transcendency in the church life. As members of the church, we are not low but have the heavenly nature with the transcendency of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Spiritual&mdash;of the Holy <em>Spirit</em><br />
in the Human <em>Spirit,</em><br />
with the Bountiful Supply of the <em>Spirit</em></h2>
<p>The kingdom is spiritual in nature because it is of the Holy <em>Spirit</em> in the regenerated human <em>spirit.</em> Romans 14:17 tells us that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Matthew 5:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; From these verses we can see that the kingdom is a matter of the Holy Spirit in our spirit. Therefore, the kingdom in its nature is spiritual.</p>
<p>In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is the Spirit mentioned by the Lord Jesus in John 7:39. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Such a Spirit has a bountiful supply. Since the Spirit has a bountiful supply, the kingdom, which is of the Spirit in our spirit, is full of the bountiful supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Human&mdash;the Kingdom of the Son of <em>Man,</em><br />
with the Human Virtues</h2>
<p>In nature the kingdom is also human, for it is the kingdom of the Son of <em>Man.</em> After man was seduced by Satan to follow him, God became a man to undo the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8) and destroy him (Heb. 2:14), so that He might reclaim the earth to be His kingdom. In the coming kingdom, which Christ will bring in (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-15), He will be the Son of Man as a sign both of His victory and glory and of Satan&rsquo;s defeat and shame.</p>
<p>Because the kingdom is human in its nature, having the human virtues, the Lord charged us not to cancel any commandment related to morality (Matt. 5:17-48). On the contrary, we should keep all commandments related to morality in order to have the human virtues to match the divine attributes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Pure&mdash;the Salt of the Earth,<br />
with the Killing Power of the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s kingdom is pure. It is the salt of the earth (Matt. 5:13), with the killing power of the death of Christ (2 Cor. 4:10a, 12a; Phil. 3:10b). In Matthew 5:13 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth.&rdquo; By nature, salt is an element that kills the germs of corruption and eliminates them. In the kingdom of God there is a nature which is as pure as the salt of the earth. This nature has the killing power of the death of Christ to kill the germs of corruption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Eternal&mdash;the <em>Eternal</em> Kingdom,<br />
with Its Unlimitedness</h2>
<p>Finally, in its nature the kingdom is eternal. It is the <em>eternal</em> kingdom (2 Pet. 1:11), with its unlimitedness.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM <br />
ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,<br />
ITS RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S GLORY,<br />
AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we covered the kingdom of God in its reality and in its nature. In this message we shall consider the kingdom in its expression in the divine attributes and with human virtues. We shall also see that the expression of the kingdom is in peacefulness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ITS EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>The expression of the kingdom involves three matters: the divine attributes, the human virtues, and our shining as the light.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In the Divine Attributes</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s attributes refer to all that belongs to God. When the things that belong to God become our experience, they become our virtues. With God there are attributes, and with us there are virtues. For example, love is an attribute of God, not a virtue. But when the love of God becomes our experience, it produces the virtue of love. Therefore, with respect to God we use the word &ldquo;attributes,&rdquo; but in relation to ourselves we use the word &ldquo;virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Divine Love</h2>
<p>First John 4:8 and 16 tell us that God is love. The divine love is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence. Thus, it is an essential attribute of God. Love as the nature of God&rsquo;s essence is the source of grace. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace. In the Gospel of John love is manifested as grace (1:14, 16-17). In the Epistle of 1 John we have the divine love as the source of grace.</p>
<p>The Epistle of 1 John reveals that when we are in the fellowship of the divine life, that is, in the enjoyment of the processed Triune God, this enjoyment will have a certain outcome. The outcome of the enjoyment of the processed Triune God is the divine love. When we enjoy the Triune God, this enjoyment issues in the divine love. With this divine love we spontaneously love others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Divine Light</h2>
<p>Light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. Therefore, the divine light is an expressive attribute of God.</p>
<p>As love, the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, is the source of grace, so light, the nature of God&rsquo;s expression, is the source of truth. When the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth. In the Gospel of John we have light manifested as truth in the Son. In 1 John we have the divine light as the source of truth. In the Son we come to the Father and experience Him as the source of truth.</p>
<p>First John 1:5 says, &ldquo;God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.&rdquo; Light is God&rsquo;s expression; it is God shining. When we dwell in God, who is the shining One, we are in light. The very God in whom we dwell is light.</p>
<p>In 1:5 we are told that in God there is no darkness at all. As light is the nature of God in His expression, so darkness is the nature of Satan in his evil works. Thank God that He has delivered us out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 2:9). The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us. This light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it (John 1:4-5). When we follow this light, we shall by no means walk in darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Divine Holiness</h2>
<p>Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God. The word &ldquo;holy&rdquo; not only means sanctified, separated, but also distinct, different, from everything that is common. Only God is distinct, different in His nature from all things. Hence, He is holy; holiness is the distinct quality of His nature, as one of His attributes.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:15 and 16 say, &ldquo;According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life; because it is written, You shall be holy, because I am holy.&rdquo; The Holy One is the Triune God&mdash;the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit (1 Pet. 1:1-2). The Father has regenerated His elect, imparting His holy nature into them (1 Pet. 1:3); the Son has redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18-19); and the Spirit has sanctified them according to the Father&rsquo;s holy nature, separating them from everything that does not fit in with God&rsquo;s holy nature so that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may become holy in all manner of life, even as holy as God Himself is.</p>
<p>The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us to be holy, therefore, is to partake of God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself. This makes our being holy, like God Himself is in His nature.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Divine Righteousness</h2>
<p>Another attribute of God is righteousness. God is righteous as well as holy. Whereas holiness is related to God&rsquo;s inward nature, righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s outward acts, ways, actions, and activities. Everything God does is righteousness. Hence, the righteousness of God is what God is in His action with respect to justice and righteousness. God is just and right. Whatever God is in His justice and righteousness constitutes His righteousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him&rdquo; (1 John 2:29). The word &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; here refers to the righteous God in 1 John 1:9 and to Jesus Christ the Righteous in 2:1. God is righteous in the blood of Jesus to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, and our Lord Jesus is the only righteous Man among all men. His righteous act (Rom. 5:18) on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners.</p>
<p>The divine love, the divine light, the divine holiness, and the divine righteousness are the main factors of the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments portray God as being a God of love and light and as being holy and righteous. Love, light, holiness, and righteousness, God&rsquo;s attributes, are the characteristics of the picture of God portrayed in the Ten Commandments. The expression of the kingdom of God is in these divine attributes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. With Human Virtues</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God has its expression not only in the divine attributes but also with human virtues, in particular with the virtues of righteousness, meekness, mercy, and purity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Righteousness</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:6 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.&rdquo; &ldquo;Righteousness&rdquo; here refers to being right in our behavior. This righteousness is related to what we are inwardly. This is indicated by the fact that we are told to hunger and thirst for righteousness so that we may be satisfied.</p>
<p>The righteousness in 5:6 is actually Christ Himself. It is the surpassing righteousness (v. 20), the righteousness on the highest plane, that can be attained only by Christ. Because He is the One who produces this highest righteousness, we need to seek Him. To hunger and thirst for righteousness is actually to hunger and thirst for Christ Himself. If we seek righteousness by hungering and thirsting for Christ, we shall be satisfied. We shall receive what we are seeking.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:10 the Lord again speaks of righteousness. &ldquo;Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and is filled with unrighteousness. Every aspect of the world is unrighteous. Therefore, we need to pay a price for the righteousness we are seeking for the kingdom of the heavens. If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we shall be persecuted for the sake of righteousness.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:10 tells us that those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed, &ldquo;for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; If we seek righteousness at a cost, suffering persecution for it, the kingdom of the heavens becomes ours. We are in its reality now, and we shall be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus speaks of the surpassing righteousness we need to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. &ldquo;I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; In this verse righteousness does not refer to the objective righteousness, which is the Christ we receive when we believe in Him that we may be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26). It refers to the subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is not obtained merely by fulfilling the old law, but by completing the old law through the fulfillment of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens, the law given by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5. This righteousness of the kingdom people, according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment (Matt. 22:11-12), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-8) and to inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.</p>
<p>To enter into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life (John 3:3, 5), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration. To enter into the kingdom of the heavens means to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Meekness</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:5 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; To be meek is not simply to be gentle, humble, and submissive. Meekness is related to something inward, to what we are in our being. To be meek means not to resist the world&rsquo;s opposition but to suffer it willingly. To be meek means not to fight or resist. If we are meek, willing to suffer the world&rsquo;s opposition in this age, we shall inherit the earth in the coming age, as revealed in Hebrews 2:5-8 and Luke 19:17, 19.</p>
<p>The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood but against the Devil, the enemy of God, and his angels, the evil powers in the air. Although we must fight against the Devil, we should not fight against people, not even those who oppose us. Toward all people, including the adversaries and opposers, we must be meek. While we are being meek toward people, we must fight against the powers of darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Mercy</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:7 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.&rdquo; To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, but to be merciful is to give someone better than what he deserves. For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be not only righteous but also merciful. If we are merciful to others, the Lord will grant us mercy (2 Tim. 1:16, 18), especially at His judgment seat (James 2:12-13).</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:7 there is the promise that those who are merciful shall receive mercy. If we judge our brothers without mercy today, we shall not receive mercy at the judgment seat. But if we have mercy on our brothers, the Lord will have mercy on us at His judgment seat. Therefore, although we should be strict in dealing with ourselves, we should be very merciful in dealing with others. This is not an outward matter; it is a matter related to our inward being.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Purity</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:8 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; To be righteous is to deal with ourselves, to be merciful is to deal with others, and to be pure in heart is to deal with God. Toward ourselves we must be strict and allow no excuses. Toward others we should be merciful, giving them more than they deserve. Toward God we must be pure in heart, seeking nothing besides Him. The reward for being pure in heart is to see God. God is our reward. No reward is greater than God Himself. We gain this reward by being righteous with ourselves, by being merciful toward others, and by being pure in heart toward God.</p>
<p>To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God&rsquo;s will for God&rsquo;s glory (1 Cor. 10:31). This is for the kingdom of the heavens. Our spirit is the organ to receive Christ (John 1:12; 3:6), whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows (Matt. 13:19). For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ. We also need to be pure in heart, single in our heart, that Christ may grow in us without frustration. If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we shall see God. Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart. This blessing is both for today and for the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Peacefulness</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.&rdquo; Satan, the rebellious one, is the instigator of all rebellion. For the kingdom of the heavens, under its heavenly ruling, we must be peacemakers with all men (Heb. 12:14). Instead of fighting with others, we should pursue peace with all men. This means that we should endeavor to keep a peaceful situation with everybody, living in peace with others.</p>
<p>If we are peacemakers, we shall be called the sons of God. The sons of the Devil make trouble, but the sons of God make peace. As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus made peace with God and man. Now, as the sons of God, we should follow Him to make peace.</p>
<p>Our Father is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20), who has a peaceful life with a peaceful nature. As those born of Him, if we would be peacemakers, we must conduct ourselves in the divine life and according to the divine nature. Thus, we shall express the Father&rsquo;s life and nature, and we shall be called sons of God.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,<br />
ITS RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S GLORY,<br />
AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider further the expression of the kingdom with human virtues, covering the matter of the highest standard of morality.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. The Highest Standard of Morality</h2>
<p>When we speak of the highest standard of morality, we are not using the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; in a traditional way. By morality we mean the standard of life God requires. The highest standard of morality is the living of the One&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues. The Lord Jesus, the God-man, was a composition of the divine essence with all the divine attributes and the human essence with all the human virtues. When He was on earth, He lived a life that was a composition of the divine attributes, especially the attributes of love, light, righteousness, and holiness, and the human virtues. This is the highest standard of morality.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers become a reproduction of Christ, the God-man, who lived a life in which the attributes of God were expressed in the virtues of man. In order to become a reproduction of Christ, we need to be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit (John 3:6), and then we need to be transformed gradually by the pneumatic Christ in our soul (2 Cor. 3:18). Then spontaneously we shall live Christ (Phil. 1:21), the God-man, by the bountiful supply of His Spirit (Phil. 1:19). We shall also be found in Christ (Phil. 3:9) as our surpassing righteousness in the power of His resurrection. Then we shall express Him in all the human virtues created by God for man. With the divine attributes of the God-man, these virtues will be strengthened, enriched, uplifted, and filled. This is what it means to say that the expression of the kingdom is with human virtues in the highest standard of morality.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. In Keeping the Principles of the Law</h2>
<p>The highest standard of morality involves keeping the principles of the law (Matt. 5:17-20). In Matthew 5:17 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.&rdquo; To fulfill the law here means three things: that Christ kept the law on the positive side; that through His substitutionary death on the cross Christ fulfilled the requirement of the law on the negative side; and that Christ complemented the old law by His new law, as continually expressed by the word, &ldquo;But I say to you&rdquo; (vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to keep the law on the positive side. When He lived on earth, He kept every aspect of the law. No one else has ever kept the Ten Commandments; the Lord Jesus kept them completely.</p>
<p>Because the Lord Jesus kept the law, He became the perfect One. His perfection qualified Him to die on the cross for us. We all have broken, transgressed, the law, but our transgressions have been dealt with through the Lord&rsquo;s substitutionary death. On the cross He was our substitute, dying for us to fulfill the law&rsquo;s requirement on the negative side.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s fulfilling the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law. The old law, with its keeping demand and punishing requirement, is over. Now, as children of the Father, we only need to fulfill the new, higher law by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s substitutionary death brought in the resurrection life. When this resurrection life comes into us, it is able to do the wonderful work of completing the law. It enables us to fulfill the higher law of the kingdom. This resurrection life is much higher than our natural life, for it is actually the divine life, the eternal life, the life on the highest plane. This highest life within us can fulfill the requirements of the highest law. In this way we keep the principles of the law to have the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom in the divine attributes with human virtues.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:20 says, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This surpassing righteousness is the condition for entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium. By keeping the highest law to the highest standard, we fulfill the condition for entering into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head4">b. In Not Being Angry (Higher than Not Murdering)</h2>
<p>According to Matthew 5:21-26, not being angry with a brother is higher than not murdering. In Matthew 5:21 and 22 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment. But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever shall say, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.&rdquo; The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder. Hence, the requirement of the new law of the kingdom is higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to control our temper and also to keep from condemning others. In verse 22 the Lord speaks about saying to our brother, &ldquo;Raca&rdquo; or &ldquo;Moreh.&rdquo; The word Raca is an expression of contempt, meaning stupid, good-for-nothing. Moreh, that is, fool, is a Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel (Num. 20:10). This expression is more serious than the expression of contempt, Raca. Because it is difficult for us not to condemn a brother or not to hold him in contempt, we should not have any confidence in our natural life but instead should experience and enjoy Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, which fulfills the requirements of the highest standard of morality.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In Not Committing Adultery<br />
and in Not Having Divorce</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 5:27-32 reveals that we should have the highest standard of morality in not committing adultery and in not having divorce. Verses 27 and 28 say, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you, that every one who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&rdquo; The law of the old dispensation deals with adultery, whereas the new law of the kingdom deals with the inward motive of the heart.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:21 and 22 the Lord Jesus speaks about anger, and in 5:27 and 28, about lust. Our anger and our lust constantly damage us and trouble us. In order to have the highest standard of morality for the kingdom in its expression, we need to overcome our anger and lust. In order to do this, we need another life&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, which is the divine life. Because of the anger and lust within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, continually experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God. Then we shall experience and enjoy the divine life, the life that can fulfill the highest standard and overcome our anger and lust.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:31 and 32 the Lord speaks about divorce. &ldquo;It was said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a divorce. But I say to you that every one who puts away his wife, except in a case of fornication, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries one that has been put away commits adultery.&rdquo; What the Lord Jesus decrees in 5:21-30 as the new law of the kingdom complements the law of the old dispensation, whereas what He proclaims in 5:31-48 as the new law of the kingdom changes the law of the old dispensation. According to the old law, a man could divorce his wife simply by giving her a writing of divorcement. The law of the old dispensation concerning divorce was ordained because of the people&rsquo;s hardness of heart (Matt. 19:7-8). The Lord&rsquo;s new decree recovers marriage back to what God designed in the beginning (Matt. 19:4-6). In His original intention and design for marriage at the beginning, God ordained one wife for one husband. Since the Lord has recovered the matter of marriage to God&rsquo;s original intention, only two things can now break the marriage tie: the death of one of the parties and adultery. Therefore, not having divorce surpasses putting away the wife with a paper of divorce.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. In Not Lying</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:33-37 says, &ldquo;Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not perjure yourself, but you shall render to the Lord what you have sworn. But I say to you, Do not swear at all, neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King. Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than this is of the evil one.&rdquo; The old law regarding swearing was that we should not perjure ourselves. The Lord&rsquo;s new law forbids us to swear in any manner, because the heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and our head are not under our control but under God&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>Our words should be simple and true. Instead of trying to convince others with many words, we should be brief and clear in our speaking. We should be able to say, &ldquo;Yes, yes; No, no.&rdquo; Whatever is excessive in our speaking is of the evil one.</p><h2 class="head4">e. In Not Avenging</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:38 and 39 say, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.&rdquo; The old law was &ldquo;an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&rdquo; This is fair, just, and righteous, but it is too low. The new law, given by the Lord Jesus in verse 39, is not to resist one who is evil. Here the Lord says that when someone strikes our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also. To do this indicates that there is no resistance and that we are not avenging ourselves.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:40 and 41 the Lord continues, &ldquo;To him who would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak also. And whoever shall compel you to go one mile, go with him two.&rdquo; If someone claims your tunic, a shirt-like undergarment, give him your cloak also. This will prove that you have no resistance. To turn the other cheek to the striker, to let the one who sues have the cloak also, and to go with the compeller the second mile prove that the believers, through the resurrection life, have the power to suffer and to be meek instead of resisting and to walk not in the flesh nor in the soul for their own interest but in the spirit for the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. In Loving the Enemies<br />
(Higher than Loving the Neighbors)</h2>
<p>Loving our enemies is higher than loving our neighbors. In Matthew 5:43-45 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.&rdquo; Legally speaking, the old law&mdash;to love our neighbor and hate our enemy&mdash;is fair and righteous, for a neighbor deserves our love and an enemy deserves our hatred. However, in order to touch our natural being and to reveal how much the divine life can do for us, the Lord requires us to love our enemies and pray for our persecutors. This surpasses loving the neighbor and hating the enemy.</p>
<p>If we love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us, we behave as sons of the heavenly Father. As sons of our Father, we should deal with the evil and the unjust as with the good and the just (v. 45), love not only those who love us but also those who do not love us (v. 46), and greet not only our brothers but also others (v. 47). To live in such a way is to be virtuous sons of the heavenly Father.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:48 the Lord Jesus concludes, &ldquo;You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo; For the believers to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect is to be perfect in His love. They are the Father&rsquo;s children, having the Father&rsquo;s life and nature. Because the believers have the divine life and the divine nature, they can be perfect as the Father is perfect.</p>
<p>The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the old dispensation. If we intend to live in the kingdom, we need to practice the high standard of morality revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5. The requirements of this high standard of morality can be met only by the Father&rsquo;s life, not by our natural life. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand. The requirements in Matthew 5 reveal how much the Father&rsquo;s life can do for us. These requirements are actually a revelation showing us that the Father&rsquo;s life can even make us perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
<p>Since we are sons of the heavenly Father possessing His life and nature, it is logical that we, His sons, should be perfect even as He is perfect. As believers in Christ, we are not only God&rsquo;s creatures; we are also His regenerated children with the divine life and nature. Thus, we are not God&rsquo;s creatures trying to imitate Him; we are the Father&rsquo;s children living the Father&rsquo;s life. We became children of God when the Spirit of God came into our spirit to regenerate us (John 3:6) and to make our spirit the habitation of God (Eph. 2:22). Now if we walk according to our regenerated spirit, we shall live by the Father&rsquo;s life and spontaneously fulfill the righteous requirement of the law (Rom. 8:4). In this way we shall become perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. Eventually, through our growth in life we shall be the same as He is and live a life with the highest standard of morality for the expression of the kingdom in the divine attributes and with human virtues.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM<br />
ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,<br />
ITS RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S GLORY,<br />
 AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover one other aspect of the kingdom in its expression in the divine attributes and with human virtues&mdash;the shining as the light. Then we shall go on to consider the kingdom in its relation to God&rsquo;s glory and in its unshakableness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Shining as the Light</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:14-16 we see that the kingdom is expressed in its shining as the light. In verse 14a the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;You are the light of the world,&rdquo; Here we see that the people of the kingdom of the heavens live a kingdom life to shine in the darkness of the world. The world, Satan&rsquo;s system, the dark human society, needs light. To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are a light effacing its darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Over the Outsiders as a City Situated<br />
upon a Mountain That Cannot Be Hidden</h2>
<p>In 5:14b the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &ldquo;A city situated upon a mountain cannot be hidden.&rdquo; As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain. Such a city cannot be hidden. Ultimately, this city will be consummated in the holy city of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:10-11, 23-24).</p>
<p>The light in Matthew 5:14 is not an individual person; on the contrary, it is a corporate city. This indicates that the kingdom people need the building. If we are in the building of the church in a practical way, we shall realize that only by being built together can we be a city situated upon a mountain. This city becomes a shining light. If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up but instead are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there. And as long as there is no city, there is no light, because the city is the light. The light is not an individual believer; it is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it. In order to shine upon others, we need to be built up as a city upon the mountaintop. For this, we need to keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body. Then we shall be a shining light as the expression of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Over Those Who Are in the House<br />
as a Lamp on the Lampstand</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:15 says, &ldquo;Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all who are in the house.&rdquo; The shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect. The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house. As the city, the light shines upon people, but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people. This indicates that our influence over others should not be just outward but also inward.</p>
<p>In order to be a lamp shining into others, we need to be without any covering. As the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden. This is the reason the Lord Jesus speaks about placing the lamp under a bushel. A lighted lamp under a bushel cannot shine out its light. Therefore, the kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by a bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety (Matt. 6:25). Hiding the lamp under the bushel indicates anxiety concerning our living. If we are anxious about our living, this anxiety will become a bushel covering our light. Instead of being covered by the bushel, we must be on the lampstand. If we live without anxiety concerning our existence, caring only for Christ and the church, we shall touch the hearts of others and shine into them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. For the Glorification of the Father<br />
Who Is in the Heavens</h2>
<p>Eventually, our shining will be for the glorification of the Father, for it will give glory to Him. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 5:16). As regenerated children of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:6), we should have good works. These good works are the behavior of the kingdom people through which others may see God and be brought to Him.</p>
<p>Our shining will glorify the Father because it expresses what God is. To glorify the Father is to give Him the glory. Glory is God expressed. When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, others see God and give glory to God.</p>
<p>God hidden is God Himself. But when God is expressed, that is the glory of God. If as the kingdom people we have such a shining light, God will be expressed in this shining, and all those around us will see the glory, God expressed. When others see God in our shining, that is the glory of God. Therefore, the shining of the kingdom as light is for the glorification of the Father.</p><h2 class="head1">V. ITS RELATION TO THE GLORY OF GOD</h2>
<p>We come now to the relation of the kingdom to the glory of God. God&rsquo;s kingdom always goes with His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Entering into the Kingdom of God<br />
and Entering into the Glory of God<br />
Will Transpire Simultaneously</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 2:12 Paul indicates that we enter into the kingdom of God and into the glory of God simultaneously. &ldquo;That you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s kingdom and glory are the goal of His calling. Contrary to what many Christians think, God has not called us to a heavenly mansion but to His kingdom and glory.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is God being manifested through us. Whenever we express God in our daily walk, that is the kingdom. The expression of God from within us is the kingdom. When we live worthily of God, living a life in the Lord Jesus Christ, there is with us a particular kind of atmosphere, and this atmosphere is God&rsquo;s kingdom. Furthermore, where the kingdom of God is, there the glory of God is also.</p>
<p>In the coming age, the entering into the kingdom of God and the entering into the glory of God will take place simultaneously. When we live by the divine life, the life of God, we surely will express God, and the expressed God is the divine glory. Since we live such a life, we are in the divine glory. Then spontaneously we are in the kingdom of God, because the kingdom of God is just God&rsquo;s manifestation in His glory with His authority for His divine administration. Hence, to enter into the kingdom of God and to enter into the expressed glory of God transpire at the same time as one thing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s Glory Goes with His Kingdom<br />
and Is Expressed in the Realm of His Kingdom</h2>
<p>Matthew 6:13 says, &ldquo;Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.&rdquo; This indicates that God&rsquo;s glory goes with His kingdom and is expressed in the realm of His kingdom. The kingdom is the realm for God to exercise His power that He may express His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. ITS UNSHAKABLENESS</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:28 reveals that God&rsquo;s kingdom is unshakable as God Himself is. The kingdom is unshakable in its substance, foundation, structure, constituents, and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Its Substance</h2>
<p>The kingdom is unshakable in its substance, which is God. In the existing substance of the kingdom, actually it is God Himself exercised and expressed in His power with His glory for His divine administration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In Its Foundation</h2>
<p>The kingdom is also unshakable in its foundation, which is Christ. The earth and the heavens are shakable. Only the Lord and the things which come out of Him will remain forever (Heb. 12:27; 1:11; 13:8). This means that the kingdom which we are receiving has come out of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The kingdom is actually the Lord Himself as the kingship within us. Daniel 2:34 and 35 will help us to understand this matter. &ldquo;Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; The stone cut without hands is the heavenly Christ, who was cut on the cross without human hands. Daniel 2:44, referring to the toes of the image, says, &ldquo;In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.&rdquo; Verse 45 also speaks of the stone, saying, &ldquo;The stone was cut out of the mountain without hands&rdquo; and &ldquo;it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the stone, which is Christ, will eventually become a great mountain filling the whole earth. This great mountain is the coming kingdom. Hence, the unshakable kingdom which we are receiving is Christ with His enlargement.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Its Structure</h2>
<p>The kingdom is unshakable in its structure, which is the church. The church is the enlargement of Christ constituted of the riches of what Christ is, and today such a church is the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). Hence, the structure of this divine kingdom is unshakable, as the unshakable divine life of Christ is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In Its Constituents</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s kingdom is unshakable in its constituents. These constituents are all the riches of the processed and consummated Triune God. Since the structure of the kingdom is the divine structure of the church, which is the enlargement of Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, its constituents are also the constituents of the church, which is the expression of the unshakable Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. In Its Expression</h2>
<p>Finally, the kingdom is unshakable in its expression, which is the glory of the Triune God, the very God Himself expressed in His glory. Such an expression nothing can shake, and it will remain and stand as the very God expressed forever.</p></body></html>
