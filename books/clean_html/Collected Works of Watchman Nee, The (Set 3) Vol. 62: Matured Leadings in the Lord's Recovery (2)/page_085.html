<h2 class="head2">The Peak of God's Salvation<br />in Romans 8 and Its Experience</h2><p>Romans 8:28-30 shows that God causes all things to work together in order that His life would shine out of us. Today God's children misapply Romans 8:28. They think that "all things work[ing] together for good to those who love God" means receiving blessing and peace, etc. For example, a man may try to catch a train but is delayed; he misses the train. But by missing it, he has avoided a train accident. Such a man would thank and praise God that all things indeed have worked together for him to have peace and blessing. I dare not say that the expression "all things work together for good" does not include peace and blessing. But this verse is not mainly on blessing and peace. God's central thought is not on blessing and peace but on our perfection through the environment. The goal of this perfection is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son.</p><p>How different is man's view from God's emphasis! Man pays attention to blessing and peace, but God causes all things to work together for good for the purpose that the life within us would be released through us. For example, do we put a spoonful of lemon extract into water and leave it there? No, we stir the water with the spoon so that the lemon extract can dissolve into the water. In this way the cup of water becomes lemon juice. This stirring is the "working together of all things." God stirs up our environment in order that we can be mingled with God's life and that His life may be manifested through us. This is the reason verse 29 speaks of our conformation to the image of God's Son. If we cooperate with His life, we will have God's life within and His image without.</p><p>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." This tells us that we have God's life inwardly and have God's sovereign arrangements outwardly. The outward arrangements match the inward life. The life within issues from the mingling of God's Spirit with our spirit. God's Spirit lives within us. The life within us demands that our spirit cooperate with God's life. The main thing is that the spirit within us must follow the Holy Spirit. If we obey Him and follow Him, the result will be life and peace. Let suffering and blessing come as they may. We do not care for the outward environment. We only care for the operation of the Holy Spirit within us. The result of obeying and following is life and peace. When we say that we should touch the spirit, we are talking about touching this kind of spirit. If we set our mind on the spirit, we will have life and peace within. This life is very rich. I have only spoken of a few crucial points. In the future we will talk more about how we can go along with the operation of the Holy Spirit within us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Consummation<br />of God's Salvation in Revelation&mdash;<br />God's Life Shining Out from Man</h2><p>In Revelation we find the same thing spoken of at the beginning of the Bible&mdash;the tree of life, the fruit of life, the glory of God, etc. In Revelation we find a group of people who are finally joined to God. They will see God. Within them is the life of God. This life will shine out as the shining of God's glory. There God and man are fully mingled together. In the new heaven and new earth, temper and patience will no longer be a problem to man. God's life will shine out through man. When God's life shines out of man, there is no longer a question of sin. A Christian's goal is the New Jerusalem. For this reason, we should not have holiness and a good temper as the standard. God is not saving us from pride to humility, from unholiness to holiness, from a bad temper to a good temper. His intention is that His own life would shine out of us. This is not a matter of sinless perfection, but a matter of God's life shining out of us; it is God's glory expressed.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S GOAL BEING TO DISPENSE LIFE TO MAN</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Sin occupies only a small place in the Bible. It takes up only a small part of it. We can say that sin in the Bible is incidental or accidental. Sin is not a big subject. Before man sinned, God placed him in front of the tree of life. God ordained man to have life before he ever sinned. Hence, it was not just a sinful Adam who had need of life. A sinless Adam had need of it as well.</p><p>We have the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. One supplies life and the other brings in vanity. Suppose there are two cups on this table. One is empty and the other is filled with water. If we take the cup with water, we will receive the supply. Otherwise, we will remain thirsty. In the same way, if we eat of the tree of life, we will surely receive the supply of life. Otherwise, we will remain empty. In the whole Bible only two books speak of the beginning. Genesis starts with In the beginning God.., while the Gospel of John begins with In the beginning was the Word. The beginning in John precedes the beginning in Genesis. Both books are on life. This shows us that from the beginning, God's attention has been on life. To us, sin is the main problem. But to God, life is His emphasis. God gave us His Son primarily for the purpose of life, not for removing sins. We often confuse the focus and the emphasis. At times we miss the subject altogether.</p><p>God's purpose in creating man is for man to receive His life. But it is man's responsibility to take this life. God created man, yet man has to eat the fruit of the tree himself. God created Adam, but he did not create a fruit and put it directly in Adam's stomach. Man's responsibility is to eat of the fruit of the tree of life and to receive God's life into him. The basic problem with the world is not sin, but the lack of life. In Genesis 2 God had only one concern, which was that man would eat of the tree of life and receive life. By Genesis 3 God had another concern; there was a twofold complication&mdash;sin plus the need of life. Today man's plight is that he only remembers the problem of sin; he forgets that there is also the matter of life. Nothing frustrates God's salvation as much as sin. God's salvation is for us to have His life and for God's only begotten Son to become His firstborn Son and our Brother.</p>
