[3]  Our prayer goes with this book, trusting that God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, "who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think," would work out what is revealed in these messages, "according to the power which operates in us."
[4]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S PLAN AND GOD'S REST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26 2:3; 2:18-24; Eph 5:22-32; Rev 12; 21:1 22:5
[5]  May God grant us light to see how these four women are related to one another and to His eternal plan.
[6]  Then we may see the position the church occupies and the responsibility she bears in this plan and how the overcomers of God will accomplish His eternal purpose.
[7]  Verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."; but verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
[8]  God's purpose is to gain a group of people who are like His Son.
[9]  When we read Romans 8:29 we find God's purpose: "Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers."
[10]  God desires to have many sons, and God desires all these sons to be like that one Son of His.
[11]  Genesis 1:1-2 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[12]  Some may ask: Why doesn't God Himself cast Satan into the bottomless pit or the lake of fire?
[13]  Our answer is: God can do it, but He does not want to do it Himself.
[14]  We do not know why He will not do it Himself, but we do know how He is going to do it.
[15]  God wants to use man to deal with His enemy, and He created man for this purpose.
[16]  He wants His creature man to deal with His fallen creature Satan in order to bring the earth back to God.
[17]  Let us read Genesis 1:26 again: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth..."
[18]  God wanted to have man to rule for Him on this earth, but man did not attain to God's purpose.
[19]  In Genesis 3 the fall took place and sin entered; man came under the power of Satan, and everything seemed to come to an end. Satan was seemingly victorious and God was seemingly defeated.
[20]  Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation, Psalm 8 speaks of God's will after man's fall, and Hebrews 2 speaks of God's will in redemption.
[21]  We will see that in the victory of redemption God still desires man to obtain authority and deal with Satan.
[22]  The Lord Jesus stood in two positions: to God He was the man at the beginning, the man whom God appointed from the very first, and to man He is the Savior.
[23]  Verse 10 continues, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory."
[24]  All things are for Him and through Him; all things are to Him and by Him.
[25]  Praise God, He has not changed His purpose in creation!
[26]  In all six days of God's work of creation, His creation of man was distinct.
[27]  But the second part, "in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens," refers to His repair and restoration work, since in this work the earth was cared for first and then the heaven.
[28]  We must note the word "behold" in Genesis 1:31.
[29]  The word "rested" is the declaration that God was satisfied, that God delighted in what He had done; it proclaims that God's purpose was attained and His good pleasure was accomplished to the fullest.
[30]  Now read Genesis 1:31 with Genesis 2:3: "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good...And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
[31]  First Corinthians 15 says that Adam was a type of the Lord Jesus, and Romans 5 says that Adam was a figure of the man who was to come.
[32]  God very carefully recorded the creation of this woman in Genesis 2, and when we come to Ephesians 5 we are clearly told that Eve typifies the church.
[33]  By then, everything was completed, and we find that Genesis 1 ends with this record: "And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good" v. 31 . From this we realize that having Adam alone, or we may say, having Christ alone, is not enough to satisfy God's heart.
[34]  God desired to have Christ, and God also desired to have a church which is exactly like Christ.
[35]  Genesis 2:19-20 says, "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
[36]  This man is a corporate man coming out of Christ.
[37]  We must realize that God takes into account the source of things, not whether they are good or evil.
[38]  But God asks, "Where does it come from?"
[39]  It says, "The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam" v. 21 . This verse does not say that God caused Adam to die, but that He caused him to fall into a deep sleep.
[40]  When Adam fell into a deep sleep, God took a rib from him.
[41]  Likewise, when Christ died, something happened to His rib, His side see John 19:31-37 .
[42]  The context of Ephesians 5 is not that Christ came to die for us because we were sinners, but that He gave Himself up for us because we are the church.
[43]  We may consider that the church is composed of many people who have been saved people like Ruth Ruth was totally involved in sin, and Boaz came to redeem her.
[44]  But this is not the picture of the church which Genesis 2 gives to us.
[45]  When people inquire concerning the history of our salvation, we always start with the fall, that is, how we committed sin and wandered in sin, how we were so evil and bad, and how we heard the gospel, believed on the Lord Jesus, and were saved.
[46]  Even though we are fallen and full of failure, even though we are fleshly and soulish, departing far from God and disobeying Him, God will still attain His purpose.
[47]  From eternity God purposed to obtain a church completely out of Christ, a church containing no impurity of man, no element of earth, nor any savor of sin.
[48]  Whenever God's Word speaks of the oneness between Christ and the church, we see Christ as the Head and the church as His Body.
[49]  Only that which comes out of Christ can return to Christ.
[50]  That which does not come out from Christ can never return to Him.
[51]  Thus, it is not only necessary to have a spiritual purpose, but the process must also be of the spirit.
[52]  The method must be of the spirit, and the man himself must be one who is of the spirit.
[53]  "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish."
[54]  No. We are not saying that the written Word of God is of no use, but that logos the Word of God recorded in the Bible is of no use to us by itself.
[55]  John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."
[56]  Did the Jews not have the logos of God?
[57]  Luke 24:8 says, "They remembered His words rhema ."
[58]  He does it with His life through His own word.
[59]  The church according to God's will and the church in experience are two entirely different things.
[60]  The church in God's plan is completely without sin; it has never known sin, nor had any history of sin.
[61]  Ephesians 4 says that the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . Then chapter five says that the church will be clothed with glory to be presented to Christ.
[62]  The book of Ephesians reveals the church which God has purposed in eternity.
[63]  And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."
[64]  When the Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God would come, the Lord Jesus answered, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There!
[65]  Revelation 1:5-6 says, "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever.
[66]  Even the birth of the Lord Jesus was the result of the cooperation of some of God's people with Him.
[67]  May God open our eyes so that we may not consider ourselves as the center.
[68]  Then we will not only be a church which is glorious, holy, and without blemish, but we will also be those who have cooperated with God to bring in His kingdom and caused Satan to suffer loss on this earth.
[69]  CHAPTER FOUR "AND SHE BROUGHT FORTH...A MAN-CHILD"
[70]  We have already seen the woman in Genesis 2 and how she speaks of the man whom God in His eternal will desires to obtain to glorify His name.
[71]  This woman shows how God is working to restore everything to His original purpose after man's fall.
[72]  Beginning with chapter twelve we are told how the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ and how God will make His Son King forever and ever.
[73]  At the end of chapter eleven, John saw another vision a vision of the temple of God.
[74]  God originally told the Israelites to build the ark according to the pattern which was given on the mount and to put the ark into the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle.
[75]  Revelation 12:1 says, "And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."
[76]  Verse 17 says, "And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus."
[77]  It is all right to say that the nation of Israel kept the commandments of God, but to say that the nation of Israel held the testimony of Jesus would mix the Old Testament with the New Testament.
[78]  Revelation 12:2 says, "And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth."
[79]  Verse 5 says, "And she brought forth a son, a man-child."
[80]  In order to see the relationship between the woman and the man-child, let us look at Galatians 4:26: "But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother."
[81]  Revelation 12:5 continues, "And her child was caught up to God and to His throne."
[82]  There it says that some will be caught up in the clouds, while here it says that the man-child was caught up to the throne of God.
[83]  The death of the Lord Jesus has already dealt with the position which Satan gained by man's fall.
[84]  The work of the church is to execute in the kingdom of God what the Lord Jesus accomplished in redemption and, consequently, to completely bring to an end the legal position of Satan gained by man's fall.
[85]  After the dragon and his angels were cast down from heaven, verse 10 says, "And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ."
[86]  The church which God desires must have the characteristic of Abigail that of cooperation with Christ.
[87]  Then Moses said to them, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor" v. 27 . The worshiping of idols is the greatest sin, so God required these men to slay their own brothers with the sword.
[88]  In Revelation 3:21 the Lord Jesus said, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne."
[89]  In the consciences of some of the Lord's children there is little feeling toward sin.
[90]  We do not say that we are without sin.
[91]  Before God we are clean because we have the precious blood.
[92]  When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him even more.
[93]  When you have the blood before God, you will have boldness before God, and you will have a testimony before man.
[94]  It is a fact that the kingdom of heaven will come; it is a fact that the Lord is King; it is a fact that Christ is victorious and forever victorious; it is a fact that Satan is defeated; it is a fact that the strong man has been bound and legally condemned; it is a fact that Christ has destroyed all the work of Satan on the cross.
[95]  Let us further illustrate by relating a certain event.
[96]  Do you remember that when the Son of God came out from Hades, God announced from heaven to all living creatures and to all spirits, 'The name of Jesus henceforth is above every name.
[97]  The purpose of the cross is to deal with us, so that we will not dare to move by ourselves.
[98]  We have already seen that the woman in Genesis 2 is the same woman seen in Ephesians 5 and in Revelation 12.
[99]  God created the heaven and the earth in Genesis, and the new heaven and the new earth are in the last two chapters of Revelation.
[100]  There is another incident in the Old Testament which outstandingly manifests this principle.
[101]  Chapter eighteen shows us many other things about Babylon, especially regarding the luxuries she enjoyed.
[102]  Concerning our attitude toward the inventions of science, we can use many things when we have a need.
[103]  But God will judge her in the end. Revelation 19:1-4 says, "After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.
[104]  God hates the principle of Babylon more than anything else.
[105]  We must note in His presence how much of our being is still not absolute for Him.
[106]  We need God to enlighten us so that in His light we may judge everything in us which is not absolute toward Him.
[107]  These are declarations from heaven, signifying the time when God speaks, the place where God speaks, and what His emphasis is on.
[108]  Revelation 19:7 continues, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him..."
[109]  Not only has God's authority commenced, but the kingdom has been ushered in. Furthermore, the corporate man, the eternal Eve whom God desired, has been obtained.
[110]  We must bear in mind that what the overcomers accomplish is not for themselves alone, but for the whole church.
[111]  The Word of God says that when one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it 1 Cor 12:26 .
[112]  This means that when the Spirit of God works upon us, He constitutes Christ into us this is the embroidery work.
[113]  But the garments are not only white, they are bright or shining 19:8 .
[114]  Verse 21:1 says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more."
[115]  Revelation 21:3 says, "And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."
[116]  The New Jerusalem is the woman whom we have been considering.
[117]  This woman sinned, and God drove her out of the garden.
[118]  Not only so, but God's throne is established in the New Jerusalem, or we may say that God Himself dwells within this woman.
[119]  Let us read again the last part of verse 3: "He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."
[120]  In verse 6, God told John, "They have come to pass."
[121]  On what ground could God say to John that it is done?
[122]  God spoke these things because He wants to tell us that He will bring His plan to fulfillment, He will reach His goal, and He will accomplish what He has begun.
[123]  We acknowledge that Satan's work has indeed interrupted the work of God, but we further acknowledge that God is not only the Alpha who purposed in the beginning, but also the Omega who will finally succeed.
[124]  And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."
[125]  Men today can behold high church buildings, they can take part in well-prepared Sunday services, and they can admire the ability of man, but in the sight of God, everything that has its origin in Babylon is in the wilderness; it is deserted.
[126]  If we are not standing spiritually on a high mountain, we will not see those who are living on the plain, we will not see the New Jerusalem, nor will we see the ultimate work of God.
[127]  After John saw the New Jerusalem, he did a very foolish thing he fell down to worship before the feet of the angel.
[128]  How we thank God that on one hand we were purchased with the precious blood of the Lord, and on the other hand, we were truly born of God.
[129]  From the standpoint of our history with sin, we were outwardly purchased; but from the standpoint of our history apart from sin, we were born of God, for whoever is born of God cannot sin.
[130]  Revelation 21:11 describes this city as "having the glory of God.
[131]  The city has three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
[132]  What God has put into us is pure gold, but because there is so much dross in us, so many things which are not of God, we have become an alloy.
[133]  Verses 19 and 20 say, "The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst."
[134]  Gold is an element because God created it as gold; it was made directly by God.
[135]  The precious stones represent the work of the Holy Spirit.
[136]  When we were saved we obtained God's nature, but from that time, day after day, the Holy Spirit has been working the nature of God into us so that we may bear the fruit of the Spirit.
[137]  Not only has God shared His nature with us, but day by day He is making us a certain kind of people who can bring glory to His name.
[138]  For this reason we should never refuse the trials that come upon us through our environment.
[139]  We should never refuse the discipline of the Holy Spirit, nor complain when God's hand encircles and encloses us in every way.
[140]  God has not only given us His life, but He is also working in us to the extent that we may possess a special quality.
[141]  First Corinthians 3:12 says that spiritual building should have materials of gold, silver, and precious stones, not wood, grass, or stubble.
[142]  In 1 Corinthians 3 there are gold, silver, and precious stones; but in Genesis 2, in the garden of Eden, there were gold, precious stones, and pearl there was no silver.
[143]  We must see that the fall is not in the purpose of God, redemption is not in the purpose of God, and neither is the kingdom something in the purpose of God.
[144]  Verse 22 says, "And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."
[145]  The temple was the place set aside for God, and it was to that place that man had to go for fellowship with God.
[146]  In the Old Testament the tabernacle was arranged so that it was in the center of the Israelites' camp.
[147]  THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE
[148]  We have yet to see what God will show us at the end. Verses 22:1-2 say, "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.
[149]  Here we are reminded of verse 2:7, which says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."
[150]  Recalling the book of Genesis, God created man as a type of Christ and the woman as a type of the church he desired to obtain in Genesis 2.
[151]  Even so, before the New Jerusalem comes into being, we need to seek a new experience of life every month.
[152]  The particular experience we had twenty years ago is no longer fresh, nor can it be of any help to us today.
[153]  Before God we must receive life continuously; we must receive Christ.
[154]  Thank God, Genesis 3 will completely pass away and there will no longer be a curse.
