   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AS THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS REVEALED IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:22-24, 30; 2:9-10; 3:11; 5:7-8; 10:3-4; 11:3; 12:12; 15:20, 47, 45; 6:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider our experience of Christ as the reality as revealed in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Epistle addresses many problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The unique solution to these problems is Christ as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Problems in the church life may be likened to physical illnesses that may occur when a person does not eat the proper food for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way to solve such problems is to eat nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is our rich food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Problems arise when the church lacks Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To save the church from problems, we need the rich experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Corinthians Christ is presented as at least eighteen items.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CHRIST BEING THE POWER OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND THE WISDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 Paul says, Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Religious people, such as the Jews, desire to see signs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Philosophical people, such as the Greeks, prefer to exercise their mind to obtain wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Miraculous signs require power, and philosophy requires wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is both power and wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to run a corporation, both power and wisdom are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a businessman has the capital, he has the financial power to start a corporation, but without the necessary wisdom he will lose everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our life may be likened to a corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is our spiritual capital; He is the power we need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is also the wisdom; He is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The power and wisdom we need to live our life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without wisdom, our way to do anything is not excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The excellent way is produced from wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cleverness is not the same as wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whereas cleverness is superficial and comes mainly from the human mind, wisdom comes from God and is higher than human cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need Christ as our power and our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST BEING RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 30 says, Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are in Christ because we have been baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is a sphere, a realm, and a kind of situation or condition into which we have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 both show that when we are baptized into the water, we are baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The water of baptism signifies not only the death of Christ but also Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ, into whom we have been baptized, became wisdom to us from God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be righteous is to do things in the way that God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever God does is not only righteous but also righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Righteousness means to be right with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only one who can be righteous is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, He is the power for us to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is also the wisdom, the way, to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With Christ, we have both the power and the wisdom to be right with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before we were saved, we were unrighteous, but when we received the Lord, we received the power and the wisdom to live righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for someone to teach us, for Christ speaks to us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I became a believer as a young person, my living spontaneously changed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before my younger brother and I were saved as teenagers, our mother could not control us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We were like two wild horses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we were saved, however, we loved to read the Bible and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The horses became lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our mother was shocked and wondered what had happened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ as the power and the wisdom of God entered into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We did not need anyone to teach us, because we had Christ in us as the power and the wisdom to behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many saints have a similar testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Others, especially our parents, may wonder what causes this great change in our living since we are not outwardly taught or regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The change in our living is a result not of religion but of our receiving Christ, a living person, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This person is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, after receiving Him, we spontaneously become righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once we receive the Lord, we have Him within us as the power and the wisdom to behave in a proper way and are thus spontaneously righteous in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are right with God, our parents, our siblings, and everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When Christ is the reality of our life, our life is a righteous life.</S>
