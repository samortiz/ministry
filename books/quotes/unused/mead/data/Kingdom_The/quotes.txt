[1]  May these chapters cause the Lord's children to soberly consider their responsibility toward the kingdom and to aspire to live today in the reality of the kingdom by the divine life so that they may enter into the enjoyment of the kingdom in its manifestation with the Lord in the coming age.
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE KINGDOM IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-2; 10:7; 16:19a; 4:17, 23; 24:14; John 3:3, 5; Luke 4:43; 9:2a, 60; Acts 1:3; 8:12a; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23b, 31; Rom 14:17; Col 1:13; 4:11b; 1 Thes 2:12; 2 Thes 1:5b; 2 Tim 4:18a; Heb 12:28a; James 2:5; 2 Pet 1:3-4, 11; Rev 1:9a; 12:10a; 11:15
[3]  According to Genesis 1, God created man in His own image and gave man His authority to rule over all the created things.
[4]  The first item in the New Testament preaching was the kingdom.
[5]  The first preacher in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and the first word out of his mouth was, "Repent for the kingdom" Matt 3:1-2 .
[6]  He sent them out and charged them to preach the kingdom saying, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" Matt 10:7; Luke 10:1, 9 .
[7]  Not only did the Lord Himself repeat and continue the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, but He also charged His disciples to repeat it.
[8]  This verse says that the Lord Jesus and His disciples preached the kingdom of God as the gospel.
[9]  Have you ever noticed that the preaching of the kingdom of God is just the preaching of the gospel?
[10]  Some Christians say that after the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected, He suspended the kingdom and that another dispensation, the dispensation of the church, began on the day of Pentecost.
[11]  In other words, they say the kingdom was temporarily set aside and the church age began.
[12]  However, Acts 1:3 says that the Lord Jesus spoke with His disciples concerning the kingdom for forty days following His resurrection.
[13]  AND ITS PROCESS Scripture Reading: Matt 19:8; Luke 17:20-21; Matt 13:55-56; 12:28; Col 1:13; Matt 16:28; Mark 9:1; Matt 17:1-2; Mark 4:26-29; Luke 18:29; Mark 10:29; John 3:3-5; 2 Pet 1:3-4, 11; Mark 10:17, 23
[14]  When the Lord Jesus came, there was a religion called Judaism.
[15]  In Luke 17:21 the Greek word rendered "within" by the King James Version means both "within" and "in the midst," and it is hard to determine the exact meaning in this verse.
[16]  Colossians 1:13 contrasts two things the authority of darkness and the kingdom of Christ.
[17]  Now you need to realize further that since you are in Christ, you are also in the kingdom because Christ is the kingdom.
[18]  One day the Lord Jesus told His disciples that some of them would not taste of death until they saw the Son of Man coming in His kingdom Matt 16:28 .
[19]  According to Mark, He said that some of those standing there would see the kingdom of God coming in power 9:1 .
[20]  I hope this sentence will make a deep impression on you: the kingdom is the shining of the Lord Jesus, and the kingdom is the spreading of the Lord Jesus by shining over you.
[21]  In Mark 4:26-29 the Lord Jesus said the kingdom is like a man who sows seed into the earth.
[22]  The kingdom is a seed that is sown into the earth and that grows until it reaches maturity, at which time it is harvested.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE GOD'S GOAL IS THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18-19; 1 Cor 4:17b-20; 6:9-11; Gal 5:21-22, 24-25; Rom 14:17; Heb 12:28
[24]  The kingdom is one item of the basic structure of the Scriptures, but it has been neglected by most Christians.
[25]  We need to illustrate once again the growth process of the kingdom.
[26]  These were words spoken by the Lord Jesus to Peter after he received the revelation from the Father that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[27]  On the day of Pentecost the Lord Jesus gave Peter the key which opened the door for the Jewish people to come in; at the house of Cornelius He gave him the key which opened the door for the Gentiles to come in. After the Lord gave Peter these two keys of the kingdom, the churches were established.
[28]  It may be that very few have noticed the term "the kingdom of God" in such a book as Galatians.
[29]  Once again Paul says that the evil, immoral persons will "not inherit the kingdom of God" Gal 5:21 .
[30]  Then Paul mentions the fruit of the Spirit v. 22 . This is the church life, the Christian walk, and the Christian walk is the kingdom.
[31]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SEED OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 1:1, 2, 6, 11, 16-18, 20, 21, 23; 2:1-13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23
[32]  As we have seen, the kingdom is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into us, growing in us, spreading in us, and maturing in us until there is a full harvest.
[33]  The full harvest is the manifestation of the kingdom.
[34]  In the first chapter of the New Testament we have the record of a wonderful One, Christ, who is recommended to us as the seed of the kingdom.
[35]  You may say that the seed of the kingdom is the Lord Jesus; yet your understanding of who He really is may be quite superficial.
[36]  The Lord Jesus was not born in such a simple way, but in a very meaningful way as the issue of all kinds of human generations, from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through the kings, and then through the captured and returned ones.
[37]  However, this is only one aspect of the Lord Jesus.
[38]  Now we come to the meaning of the number forty-two.
[39]  In the Bible we have the number forty and also the number forty-two.
[40]  Not only was this wonderful seed rejected by the religion, but He was also persecuted by politics.
[41]  He persecuted the Lord Jesus, destroying many young lives by his persecution Matt 2:16 .
[42]  On the first page of the New Testament we see what a wonderful One the Lord Jesus is as the seed of life for the kingdom.
[43]  The kingdom is the totality of Christ as life, spread into us with all of His activities.
[44]  In that parable the Lord Jesus likened the kingdom to a seed that is sown into the earth, grows, brings forth fruit, and eventually produces the harvest.
[45]  In chapter one of Matthew, we have the presentation of the seed.
[46]  In chapter two we have the proper people to receive the seed.
[47]  First, Matthew 3 tells us that the sowing of the Lord Jesus as the seed has nothing to do with culture or religion.
[48]  In the book Christ Versus Religion, we pointed out that the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, John the Baptist, came forth without any culture or religion.
[49]  When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit came down upon Him in the form of a dove.
[50]  He was conceived of the Holy Spirit Luke 1:31, 35; Matt 1:20 , and the Holy Spirit was mingled with His human nature within.
[51]  When the Lord Jesus came to be baptized, He was already a man whose human element was mingled with divinity.
[52]  After defeating the enemy, the Lord Jesus went to Galilee of the Gentiles Matt 4:12-17 .
[53]  If we had no record in the Bible, we could never realize that His going to Galilee was the shining of a great light.
[54]  OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Matt 5:1-2, 3, 8, 10, 20, 45a, 48; 6:10, 33; 7:16-18, 21-23; 19:7-8, 10; 1 Pet 3:4
[55]  In chapter four of Matthew a group of people were attracted to the Lord Jesus, and in chapter five He brought them to a high mountain v. 1 . They had been following Him, but He still needed to get inside of them.
[56]  In addition to the problem involving our spirit, there is a further problem with our heart.
[57]  Although we may have repeated the words, "Thy kingdom come," many times, the kingdom has not come because we are not poor in our spirit to receive Christ, nor are we pure in our heart toward God.
[58]  In chapters five through seven of Matthew, we see that the kingdom is a matter of righteousness.
[59]  When the Lord Jesus returns, many Christians will say to Him in that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?"
[60]  Eventually the Lord Jesus said, "You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" Matt 5:48 .
[61]  He did not say that we should be perfect as a gentleman, but perfect as our heavenly Father.
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN IMAGE AND DOMINION Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 2:9; 3:1, 18a; 1 John 3:9, 10a; John 8:44; Matt 23:33; Matt 12:34; 3:7, 9; 7:16; 5:9, 45a, 48, 13a, 14a, 16; Rev 22:1-2
[63]  In Genesis 1:26 we are told that God created man with two main aspects.
[64]  However, Genesis 2:9 also reveals a source other than God the evil one, Satan, the adversary of God.
[65]  Genesis 3:18 mentions two other negative words thorns and thistles.
[66]  The Lord Jesus asked, "Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?"
[67]  In this universe there are actually two fathers: God, the Holy Father and Satan, the evil father.
[68]  Therefore, among the human race there are only two kinds of children, God the Father's children and Satan's children.
[69]  CHAPTER EIGHT TWO KINGDOMS Scripture Reading: Matt 12:22-28; Luke 22:3a; Acts 5:3; John 12:31; 1 John 5:19; Eph 2:2, 3, 5; Phil 2:13; Eph 6:11-12; Acts 26:18a; Col 1:13
[70]  In the last chapter we saw clearly that there are two sources in the universe, that in these two sources are two lives, and out of these two lives come two kingdoms.
[71]  Satan has his evil life, out of which the kingdom of Satan comes into existence.
[72]  The kingdom of God is a matter of the divine life, and the kingdom of Satan is a matter of the satanic life.
[73]  In His word to the Pharisees, the Lord revealed that Satan has his kingdom Matt 12:26 .
[74]  They may think that they are working for the kingdom of God, yet unknowingly be working for the kingdom of Satan.
[75]  It is of tremendous importance to realize that at the very beginning there were two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:9 .
[76]  The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of knowledge signifies Satan.
[77]  Satan takes the human body as his dwelling place, but the Lord Jesus takes the human spirit as His dwelling.
[78]  God in His sovereignty has preserved the human spirit for Himself.
[79]  OF THE TWO KINGDOMS Scripture Reading: Matt 12:26; Acts 26:18a; Phil 2:13; Matt 10:19-20; Eph 2:2; 4:17-18; 2 Cor 4:4; Eph 6:11-12; 2 Cor 10:4-5; 11:2-3; Rom 8:6
[80]  The Bible reveals that in the universe there are three parties: God, man, and Satan.
[81]  God even permitted Satan to enter into man, but not to go so far as to enter man's spirit.
[82]  Since Satan has come into us and since the Lord Jesus has also come into us, it is possible for us to be in three kingdoms.
[83]  If we live in our soul, we are certainly in the human kingdom.
[84]  If we live according to the flesh, we become a part of the satanic kingdom.
[85]  If we walk in the spirit and live according to the spirit, we are in the kingdom of God.
[86]  In Matthew 12:29 the Lord Jesus said that unless the strong man is bound, no one can enter his house and plunder his vessels.
[87]  If we are going to plunder his vessels, even all his house, we must first bind the strong man.
[88]  CHAPTER TEN THE KINGDOM AND THE SOUL-LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 10:37-39; Luke 14:26-27; 17:31-33; Matt 16:21-26; Mark 8:34-36; Luke 9:23-25; John 12:24-25
[89]  We have seen that Satan is in our flesh, that the Lord Jesus is in our spirit, and that we ourselves are in our soul.
[90]  Whether Satan or the Lord Jesus would gain the victory depends on the attitude we take.
[91]  Many people have studied the verses in the four Gospels in which the Lord Jesus speaks about the soul, but they have not seen that these verses are linked to the kingdom.
[92]  In the last chapter we pointed out that our mind is the battlefield between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan.
[93]  As we have seen, Satan is in our flesh, operating for his kingdom, and the Lord Jesus is in our spirit, operating for the kingdom of God.
[94]  Our relationship with the world also requires that we bear the cross.
[95]  Now we come to the self, something deeper and more hidden than the love of the world.
[96]  The soulish life denotes not only the soulish being, but also the power and strength by which we do things.
[97]  If we do things in the church and in the Lord's work according to our being and according to our strength, that is a display of the soulish life.
[98]  As we have seen, John the Baptist proclaimed the kingdom of the heavens; the Lord Jesus later followed this preaching and taught His disciples to do the same.
[99]  He sent out the twelve and also the seventy to preach the kingdom of the heavens Matt 10:5-7; Luke 10:1, 9 .
[100]  Matthew 13 reveals that there are many mysteries related to the kingdom of the heavens.
[101]  The parables in this chapter are not merely teachings or stories; they are mysteries difficult for people to apprehend.
[102]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 13:24-33; Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:17a THE THORNY PLACES
[103]  In many respects the United States is a good place for the church life.
[104]  From Matthew 13 we go on to 1 Corinthians 3.
[105]  In this chapter Paul clearly states that we are God's farm, that he planted and Apollos watered, and that God gave the growth.
[106]  The Lord Jesus said that the mustard seed is the smallest of the seeds, yet it grows into a great tree.
[107]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE MYSTERIES OF THE KINGDOM 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 13:44-50; Exo 19:5; Psa 135:4; 1 Cor 10:32; Acts 20:28
[108]  The parables in Matthew 13 are concerning the mysteries of the kingdom.
[109]  The difference is that this reality was presented by the Lord Jesus to His disciples in a mysterious way and not in an open way.
[110]  Others indicated that the leaven also was good and positive, saying that if bread does not contain leaven, it is difficult for people to eat.
[111]  However, according to Leviticus 2:4, God did not allow any leaven to be added to the meal offering.
[112]  Now we come to the three remaining parables in Matthew 13: the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
[113]  In the eyes of God, there are only two worlds: one signified in the Bible by the earth, the other signified by the sea.
[114]  AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: John 1:42; Matt 16:18-19; 18:17-18; 21:42; Acts 4:11-12; 1 Pet 2:2, 4-5, 7; Rev 22:1-2
[115]  In 16:16 Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[116]  After Peter made this declaration, the Lord seemed to say, "You have recognized that I am the Christ, the Son of God, but I must tell you something more.
[117]  I am very happy that Matthew 18:17-18 is in the Bible.
[118]  Peter received a new name, signifying a new element, and a new being.
[119]  The Lord Jesus told Peter twice that he was a stone John 1:42; Matt 16:18 .
[120]  Evidently, he never forgot it because when Peter wrote his first Epistle, he not only said that Christ was a living stone, but also that all who come to Him are living stones to be built up as a spiritual house for God 1 Pet 2:4-5 .
[121]  The New Jerusalem faces four directions north, south, east, and west.
[122]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GROWTH, TRANSFORMATION, AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: Matt 16:28; Mark 9:1; Matt 16:18-19; Rom 14:17-18; 1 Cor 4:17, 20; 3:2, 6, 9-12, 16
[123]  The revelation of God in the Bible follows a very important principle: what is mentioned in the beginning has as its consummation at the end. From the beginning of the Bible to the end, one line and one flow is revealed.
[124]  Genesis 2 mentions the tree of life and Revelation 22 likewise mentions the tree of life.
[125]  The Lord Jesus as the seed has been sown into us so that He may grow in us, transform us, and build us up, all of which are aspects of the kingdom.
[126]  Matthew is not a book of mere stories or doctrines; it is a book giving us a revelation of the kingdom.
[127]  The kingdom is the wonderful Christ who has been sown into us, and who grows in us, transforming us until we reach maturity.
[128]  If we look at Matthew from a heavenly angle, we will see that it reveals the Lord Jesus as the seed of the kingdom, as the gradual growth of the kingdom, and as the full maturity of the kingdom.
[129]  Many of those who have been involved in the Pentecostal or charismatic things say that 1 Corinthians is a book concerning speaking in tongues.
[130]  As we have seen in the last chapter, 1 Corinthians 3 covers the matters of growth, transformation, and building.
[131]  What is the best way, actually the only way, to help children grow?
[132]  All the mothers know the best way is not to teach them, but to feed them.
[133]  Why did the Apostle Paul write 1 Corinthians 3 as he did?
[134]  The seed is in Matthew, its growth is in the Epistles, and the harvest is in Revelation.
[135]  Within the process of transformation is the shaping of life.
[136]  In every form of life there is the life essence, life power, life law, and life shape.
[137]  In this chapter we come to the parable of the ten virgins found in Matthew 25:1-13.
[138]  The number twelve is not the result of addition but of multiplication.
[139]  If it were the result of addition, the number would be seven and not twelve.
[140]  In the early chapters of the book of Revelation, we see the addition of three plus four, giving us seven churches, seven lampstands, seven seals, and seven trumpets Rev 1:4, 12; 6:1; 8:2 .
[141]  Many Christians have the concept that death automatically solves all problems.
[142]  According to this concept, if they believe in the Lord Jesus, everything is settled when they die, regardless of whether they have been wise or foolish, good or bad.
[143]  According to the Bible we have three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body 1 Thes 5:23 .
[144]  At the time we were saved, the Lord came into our spirit and we were regenerated John 3:6 , but God cannot be expressed from our spirit alone.
[145]  Most Christians realize that oil is a symbol of the Spirit of God.
[146]  In the Spirit of God we have the indwelling God: the Power of God dwelling in human body and working in it what the Father and Son have for us...what the Father has purposed and the Son has procured, can be appropriated and take effect in the members of Christ who are still here in the flesh, only through the continual intervention and active operation of the Holy Spirit."
[147]  At midnight there was a cry, "Behold, the Bridegroom!"
[148]  We may compare this to 1 Thessalonians 4:16, which says that there will be a shout when Christ comes.
[149]  IN THE EPISTLES Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13-14; 2:1, 5; 3:16-17, 19; 5:5, 18
[150]  Ephesians 1 tells us that our lamp has been enlightened and is now shining.
[151]  Ephesians 3 tells us we need an extra portion of the all-inclusive Spirit to fill up our soul, our heart, and every part of our inward being.
[152]  God is very wise, and He knows how to deal with us.
[153]  God does not ask us to pay anything for the first step.
[154]  Ephesians 5:5 speaks of an inheritance in the kingdom.
[155]  Although Ephesians is a book on the church, it also refers to the kingdom, because the proper church life is the reality of the kingdom.
[156]  IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:9b; Rev 12:10a; 14:1, 3, 4, 14-16; 21:2, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 21; 22:1, 2a
[157]  The seed of the kingdom is sown in Matthew, the sprouting of the seed takes place in Acts, and the growth occurs in the Epistles.
[158]  Then in the book of Revelation there is the maturity, which is the harvest for the full coming of the kingdom.
[159]  The Bible says clearly that the Lord Jesus is with us all the days until the consummation of the age Matt 28:20 .
[160]  Since He is with us, how can He come in the future?
[161]  Many Christians talk about watching and praying, but few realize the real meaning of watching and praying.
[162]  The way to watch is simply to grow in Christ.
[163]  Revelation 14:14-16 tells us that the Lord harvested the wheat.
[164]  CHAPTER TWENTY BAPTIZED INTO THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19, 20b; Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3; 1 Cor 12:13; 2 Cor 1:21-22; 3:17a, 18; Eph 6:17-18; John 6:63; Rev 3:1; 21:6; 22:17
[165]  The book of Matthew begins with a wonderful Person.
[166]  He is the issue of many human generations mingled with the Triune God.
[167]  Galatians 3:27 says, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
[168]  Many Pentecostal friends say that according to 1 Corinthians 12, there are nine manifestations of the Holy Spirit.
[169]  But actually there are many more, because among the nine manifestations listed in 1 Corinthians 12, there is no mention of dreams.
[170]  Dreams are mentioned in Acts 2, where it says that in the last days God will pour out His Spirit on all flesh and men shall dream dreams Acts 2:17 .
[171]  In Matthew 28 there is the seed of baptism into the Triune God, and in the Epistles there is the growth of the seed.
[172]  We have already referred to Romans 6:3, which says that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus.
[173]  "In one Spirit we have all been baptized into one body...and we have all been made to drink of one spirit" 1 Cor 12:13, Gk.
[174]  To be baptized into the Spirit means that you are put into the Spirit; to drink of the Spirit means that the Spirit is put into you.
[175]  Matthew is the New Testament book that deals specifically with the matter of the kingdom.
[176]  In nearly every chapter the central point is the kingdom.
[177]  By comparing these two Gospels, we can see that the cases selected and presented in each of them are absolutely different because John stresses life and Matthew stresses the kingdom.
[178]  The first case concerns a leper who came to the Lord Jesus asking to be cleansed 8:1-4 .
[179]  To be a leper means to be unclean; to be a believer means to be a person of faith in the Lord Jesus.
[180]  On the one hand we are lepers; on the other hand we have a certain realization of the Lord Jesus.
[181]  The tax collector in chapter nine is a case which further illustrates the kingdom.
[182]  Matthew 9:9 says that Matthew was a publican, a tax collector, a Jew who collected taxes for the Roman imperialists.
[183]  Beginning with Matthew 8, there are several cases which illustrate principles related to the kingdom.
[184]  Although our leprosy has been cleansed and faith is here for our enjoyment of Christ, we must realize that human culture stands in opposition to the kingdom of God.
[185]  You may think that only sinful things are against the kingdom, but according to the Bible, sinful things do not oppose the kingdom of God as much as human culture.
[186]  Let us now proceed to chapter eleven where we see even more principles of the kingdom.
[187]  One of the principles revealed in this chapter is that we must be violent against all opposition to the kingdom of God 11:12 .
[188]  We should not be so nice or we will be unable to enter the kingdom.
[189]  Matthew 11:25-27 reveals another basic principle: the kingdom is absolutely a matter of divine revelation.
[190]  After speaking about John the Baptist, the Lord turned to talk to the Father.
[191]  It seems that as the Lord Jesus was talking to the people, the heavenly Father asked Him a question: "Do you mean that God the Father hides the kingdom from the wise and intelligent?"
[192]  Once we forsake our wisdom and intelligence, we will know the Lord Jesus and have a real enjoyment of Him.
[193]  Chapter twelve of Matthew reveals some further principles concerning the kingdom.
[194]  When the Lord Jesus was dealing with religious people, He was very wise.
[195]  The Pharisees considered themselves to be very scriptural; they thought they did everything according to the Bible.
[196]  Following this, Matthew quoted a portion from Isaiah telling us who the Lord Jesus was at that time Matt 12:18-21 .
[197]  As we have pointed out previously, Matthew is a book which reveals the kingdom.
[198]  Chapters one through seven may be considered as the first section of the book, with chapters five through seven being a definition or description of the kingdom.
[199]  Beginning with chapter eight and continuing through chapter twelve, Matthew presents many cases which illustrate the genuine kingdom life.
[200]  By these illustrations we can realize that the Lord Jesus is everything to the kingdom people.
[201]  At the end of chapter twelve there is an incident involving the mother and brothers of the Lord.
[202]  When He learned that they wanted to speak with Him, He asked, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?"
[203]  The Lord went on to say that it is not a matter of natural birth, but of doing the will of God.
[204]  In chapter fourteen we are told that Herod the king killed John the Baptist.
[205]  When the report of this was brought to the Lord, He simply retreated into the wilderness.
[206]  Since the Lord Jesus repudiated everything natural and made the kingdom a mystery, the religious people rejected Him and the kingdom, and the political people persecuted and killed those who accepted the kingdom.
[207]  How can we make a living in the wilderness?
[208]  After feeding the multitude, the Lord Jesus went to a high mountain to pray, and He sent His disciples to the sea 14:22-23 .
[209]  The life of the kingdom people today is a life in the wilderness, and the way of the kingdom people is a way on the stormy sea.
[210]  If our living is in the wilderness, He will take care of us.
[211]  If our way is on the sea, He is on the mountain praying for us and treading upon all the waves.
[212]  In this chapter we will continue the matter of following the Lord Jesus during the period from His rejection in Matthew 13 until the full coming of the kingdom in the future.
[213]  As we have pointed out, the book of Matthew was not written according to historical sequence, but according to revelation.
[214]  From chapter thirteen to the first part of chapter seventeen, Matthew put several incidents together in order to show us the proper way to follow the Lord Jesus during the time of His rejection and before the manifestation of the kingdom.
[215]  Now we come to the third point of following the Lord Jesus during the time of His rejection.
[216]  Apparently, the case of the Canaanite woman is unrelated to the case of the outward washing of hands.
[217]  This case concerns the Lord Jesus as our food, our nourishment.
[218]  Following this, we have the third case in which the Lord Jesus charged His disciples not to take any leaven.
[219]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX FROM REJECTION TO GLORY 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-17, 18-19, 21-27, 28; 17:1-2, 3-5, 8
[220]  After reading the last chapter, you may answer that Christ is the bread, the crumbs under the table.
[221]  The Lord goes on to mention the gates of Hades Matt 16:18 .
[222]  Don't say now that we should bind the strong man; that is the wrong weapon.
[223]  CONCERNING THE KINGDOM LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 17:1-8, 14-21, 24-27; 18:1-4, 17, 21-22, 33-35; 19:3-8; Rom 14:1-6 CASTING OUT THE DEMONS
[224]  In Matthew 17:1-8 we are shown a miniature of the full manifestation of the kingdom.
[225]  A number of saints in the churches have been baptized more than once.
[226]  Some people have said this is wrong, that they should be baptized only once.
[227]  In this chapter the Holy Spirit put some points together to show us how to have the proper church life for the kingdom.
[228]  If we have the proper church life, we have the reality of the kingdom.
[229]  In Matthew 18 we see a third aspect of the proper church life the little children living at home are quick and ready to forgive others.
[230]  Peter considered that forgiving his brother seven times was sufficient, but the word of the Lord Jesus was "seventy times seven."
[231]  Now we go on to chapter nineteen to consider another point.
[232]  In the kingdom we should not insist on any legality, but we must maintain high moral standards.
[233]  The Lord Jesus told this rich young man that if he wanted to enter into life he had to keep the commandments.
[234]  When the young man asked which commandments, the Lord enumerated six: not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to bear false witness, to honor his parents, and to love his neighbor as himself.
[235]  The Lord Jesus simply said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, follow Me" v. 21 . The Lord's words were a real test of his genuine love for his neighbor.
[236]  The Lord Jesus next spoke a parable to further illustrate the impossibility of earning the kingdom or of paying a certain price for it.
[237]  In the first century, the Lord Jesus came and saw some idle fishermen.
[238]  Throughout the following centuries the Lord has been calling people to labor in His vineyard.
[239]  In this chapter the Lord Jesus rebuked the scribes who knew the Bible so well and the Pharisees who were so religious, calling both of them hypocrites.
[240]  The chief priests and the elders then came to the Lord Jesus Matt 21:23-27 .
[241]  He told them of a man who owned a vineyard and hired people to take care of it for him.
[242]  In the parable of the vineyard, the Lord Jesus did not use the term, "the kingdom of the heavens was likened to," because strictly speaking, at the time of the parable of the vineyard, the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come.
[243]  Even in the parable of the two sons, which described the refusal of the priests and elders to repent, the Lord did not mention the kingdom of the heavens but the kingdom of God.
[244]  We have been called, and we did not reject that calling.
[245]  Although the Lord Jesus spoke in such a clear way, those foolish ones did not understand at all, and the Pharisees and the Herodians still tried to trap Him.
[246]  Following this, a lawyer who was an expert in the law of Moses, assured that he could defeat the Lord Jesus, asked Him, "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
[247]  To this the Lord Jesus answered clearly and simply, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind...And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself" 22:37, 39 .
[248]  AND REIGNING Scripture Reading: Matt 22:1-14, 15-22, 23-32, 34-40, 41-46
[249]  We need to remember that Matthew is a book in which the seeds of the kingdom are sown.
[250]  Christians pay attention to many things, but neglect Christ.
[251]  The men who tested the Lord Jesus completely missed the mark, but the Lord Jesus knew what He was doing.
[252]  Christ is further revealed in the parable of the marriage feast.
[253]  Strictly speaking, the kingdom is not a matter of labor; it is a matter of enjoyment.
[254]  In Matthew these items of Christ are in seed form.
[255]  In answering the foolish questions of the religious people, the Lord Jesus spontaneously revealed Himself in a full way.
[256]  Matthew 5, 6, and 7 reveal the reality of the kingdom.
[257]  If we are going to understand all the chapters and verses in Matthew regarding the kingdom, we have to see these three main aspects of the kingdom.
[258]  The character or nature of the kingdom people is revealed in Matthew 5:1-12.
[259]  We may also say this is the element or substance or essence of the children of the kingdom.
[260]  The first item of the inward condition is in Matthew 5:3: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens."
[261]  The first basic condition is related to our spirit, which is the very place where God can dwell.
[262]  Our spirit is the organ within us created by God for us to contact Him, to take Him in, to receive Him, and to contain Him.
[263]  If we are poor in spirit, surely we will mourn.
[264]  Verse 8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[265]  If our heart is pure we will see God.
[266]  If we have such a character, we will surely exert an influence upon the world.
[267]  The Lord Jesus said that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[268]  Not to swear surpasses not swearing falsely Matt 5:33-37 .
[269]  To swear falsely is to neglect to fulfill what you have promised and sworn to do.
[270]  All of the aspects of the reality of the kingdom mentioned in Matthew 5 are related to life.
[271]  The children of the kingdom do good deeds, and in their deeds there is no mixture, falsehood, hypocrisy, or pretension.
[272]  In the years of 1933 and 1934, the church in Shanghai, the largest church in the Lord's recovery in China, needed land on which to construct a meeting hall to seat five hundred people.
[273]  At that time land was very expensive, and it was difficult to afford an adequate lot.
[274]  We have seen that the kingdom of God is simply another term for Christ.
[275]  In the book of Philippians we do not have such a term as the kingdom, but we do find a synonymous term Christ.
[276]  We have considered five aspects of the reality of the kingdom life: the character of the children of the kingdom, the influence of the children of the kingdom, the righteousness of the children of the kingdom, the purity of the children of the kingdom in their good deeds, and the attitude of the children of the kingdom toward mammon or riches.
[277]  Now we come to the sixth aspect the principle of the children of the kingdom toward others.
[278]  Matthew 12:36 says that we shall give account of every idle word in the day of judgment.
[279]  We should not think that after gossiping there is no further problem, for the Lord has said that our idle words will be judged.
[280]  Our talking is also related to another very important matter the matter of prayer.
[281]  In Matthew 7:7-8 the Lord said that if we ask, we will receive; that if we seek, we will find; that if we knock, it shall be opened to us.
[282]  The first ground is the narrow gate and the constricted way Matt 7:13-14 .
[283]  The second ground of the children of the kingdom for their walk and work is the fruit brought forth of a good tree Matt 7:15-20 .
[284]  Now we come to the last ground, the word of Christ as the rock.
[285]  Our work must be according to the living word of Christ, not according to the dead letter.
[286]  As we have mentioned previously, Matthew 5, 6, and 7 unveil the reality of the kingdom.
[287]  In the fourth section there are four circles which represent various aspects of the kingdom of the heavens.
[288]  The innermost circle represents the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.
[289]  In Matthew 13, there are three parables which indicate the outward appearance of the kingdom.
[290]  Another group of people who are tares are the so-called Christians who do not believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins.
[291]  Rather, they consider the Lord's crucifixion as a kind of martyrdom.
[292]  We must realize that the Lord Jesus did not die on the cross as a martyr but to accomplish our redemption.
[293]  In summary, if a person claims to be a Christian and yet does not believe that the Bible is inspired by God word by word, that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, even God Himself, and that the Lord Jesus died on the cross for our redemption, that person is a tare.
[294]  If you believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, that He was incarnated to be man, that He died on the cross for your sins, and that today He is the Lord and the life-giving Spirit who has come into you, surely you are wheat.
[295]  The third parable is the parable of the mustard seed.
[296]  "Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is indeed smaller than all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches" vv.
[297]  In the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens there are not only the tares and the great tree, but there is also something hidden within the leaven.
[298]  "Another parable he spoke to them: the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened" 13:33 .
[299]  In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord Jesus spoke of the kingdom on three different occasions.
[300]  In the Sermon on the Mount, given in Matthew 5, 6, and 7, He spoke concerning the reality of the kingdom.
[301]  In Matthew 13 in a discourse given at the seashore, He spoke concerning the appearance of the kingdom.
[302]  Then on the Mount of Olives, the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the manifestation of the kingdom.
[303]  Now we come to the parable of the talents.
[304]  As genuine Christians we have two aspects in our relationship with the Lord.
[305]  Sometimes we come to the meeting in an idle, sloppy, and slothful way.
[306]  We excuse ourselves by saying that we are tired, and we come with no intention of functioning.
[307]  We all must realize that the Lord is hard.
[308]  He does not give something to you, but He asks something of you.
[309]  He does reap where He has never sown, and He does gather where He has never scattered.
[310]  Whenever you open your mouth and function, immediately you open the way for the Lord to come out.
[311]  In verse 21, "His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord."
[312]  This verse is not related to salvation but to a reward.
[313]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Luke 19:11-27; Matt 24:44-51; Luke 12:42-48; Matt 19:28; 20:21-23; 2 Tim 2:12a; Rev 2:26-27; 3:21; 12:5; 20:4-6
[314]  As we have said previously, the Gospel of Matthew reveals three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens.
[315]  In Matthew 5, 6, and 7 we see the reality of the kingdom.
[316]  Those who are in the reality of the kingdom are poor in spirit, pure in heart, have the surpassing righteousness, do the will of God, and have become like little children.
[317]  Do not argue in a doctrinal way concerning this matter.
[318]  In your experience, do you have five talents, or two talents, or one talent?
[319]  If you are in the third category having one talent, are you a faithful servant or not?
[320]  In Luke 19, while the religious people were expecting the kingdom of God to appear, the Lord Jesus spoke a parable to show them that it would not appear as they thought.
[321]  Some dispensational teachers may say that this portion in Matthew is only for the Jewish people.
[322]  Let us then read Luke 12, which not only mentions the same thing in principle, but even in a more serious way.
[323]  Verses 46 and 47 say that the lord of that servant "will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
[324]  Matthew 19 tells us something further concerning the reigning and ruling aspect of the kingdom.
[325]  It tells us that when the Lord Jesus will reign during the millennium, His Apostles such as Peter, James, and John will also reign with Him.
[326]  All the verses in the Scripture reading are related to three things: the second coming of the Lord Jesus, the manifestation of the kingdom, and the matter of receiving a reward or suffering a loss.
[327]  Many Christians like to talk about the second coming of the Lord Jesus and also about the coming of God's kingdom.
[328]  Some might argue that because the Lord's redemption is complete, that He died for them, they have no need to suffer any punishment.
[329]  According to their concept, it is simply a matter of being saved or of perishing.
[330]  Near the end of Paul's life, just before he was martyred, he had the assurance that he would receive the reward.
[331]  When the Lord Jesus returns, He will reckon with all His servants.
[332]  If we are not faithful to the Lord today, when He reckons with us at His coming back, we will lose what we received as a gift from Him; we will miss the marriage feast and the joy of reigning with the Lord as co-kings for a thousand years.
[333]  Most Christians realize that at the end of this age the Lord Jesus will come back, and the believers will be raptured.
[334]  Before the harvest was reaped in Revelation 14:14, there had been a reaping already.
[335]  Revelation 14:1 says, "And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."
[336]  CHAPTER FORTY THE LORD'S DEALING WITH THE BELIEVERS AT HIS COMING BACK Scripture Reading: Matt 24:39b-44; 1 Thes 4:15-17; 1 Cor 15:50-54; 2 Thes 2:1-4, 8; 1:5-10; Phil 3:20-21; 1 John 3:2; Rev 2:25; 3:3; 16:15; 19:11-16; 22:7, 12
[337]  All these Scriptures reveal how the Lord will deal with the believers at His coming back.
[338]  The application of the Lord's power to our bodies is, in a sense, the rapture.
[339]  When the Lord Jesus will catch us away into the air, He will not only move us positionally from the earth to the air, but He will also change our vile bodies into glorious ones.
[340]  Other Christians consider that the rapture will occur with all Christians simultaneously.
[341]  They think that when the Lord Jesus comes back, all of the real believers will be taken suddenly from the earth into the air at the same time.
[342]  With this in mind we need to read 1 Thessalonians 4:15: "For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep" ASV .
[343]  This means that the dead believers will be resurrected first, and then the living believers will be raptured.
[344]  It is not that we will be raptured first and then the dead ones will be resurrected.
[345]  Revelation 3:10 says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."
[346]  In this verse, the Lord Jesus promised that the church in Philadelphia would be preserved from the period of tribulation.
[347]  The New Testament uses several different words to describe the Lord's coming.
[348]  This is the rapture as revealed in the New Testament.
[349]  What then will happen to all of the defeated Christians?
[350]  They will have no share in reigning as co-kings with Christ during the millennium.
[351]  Because they have been living in the present reality of the kingdom, they will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom to enjoy the marriage feast and reign with Christ in the millennium.
[352]  During the time of the Exodus the children of Israel experienced in principle the same kind of deliverance.
[353]  The age of the Gentiles began with Nebuchadnezzar, who was typified by the golden head in the great image.
[354]  In the Old Testament the kingdom was a matter of prophecy.
[355]  The evil spirits will be released to stir up the people from the Far East, who will come with their horsemen in the number of two hundred million.
[356]  Now let us consider how the Lord will deal with the Jews at His coming back.
[357]  During the age of the church the Lord has temporarily given up the people of Israel and treats them like the Gentiles.
[358]  The present situation in the Middle East is very significant!
[359]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE LORD'S JUDGMENT OF THE GENTILES
[360]  AFTER THE WAR OF ARMAGEDDON Scripture Reading: Matt 25:31-46; 13:47-50; Rev 14:6-7; Acts 10:42; 2 Tim 4:1; Matt 19:28; Acts 3:21; Isa 11:6-9
[361]  This judgment of the nations by the Lord will not be without a warning.
[362]  Revelation 14:6-7 says, "And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those settled on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him Who has made the heaven and the earth and the sea and springs of waters."
[363]  Both Acts 10:42 and 2 Timothy 4:1 tell us that the Lord Jesus was appointed by God to judge the living and the dead.
[364]  Before the millennium the Lord Jesus will judge the living unbelievers on the throne of glory Matt 25:31 .
[365]  After the thousand years all the dead people of the nations will be resurrected, and the Lord Jesus will judge them at the great white throne Rev 20:11-12 .
[366]  The nations who will be considered as sheep at that time will be preserved not by regeneration but by restitution.
[367]  We have pointed out previously that many matters concerning the kingdom are in Matthew in seed form.
[368]  The seed of mourning is sown in Matthew 5:4: "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
[369]  The seed of being pure in heart is developed in 2 Timothy 2:22c: "With them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
[370]  That is, you must pursue righteousness, peace, and love with all those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
[371]  The children of the kingdom must have a righteousness that surpasses others' righteousness.
[372]  In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus told us what our attitude should be toward giving, praying, and fasting.
[373]  In Matthew the Lord Jesus told us that we should not judge others Matt 7:1-5 .
[374]  The second seed that the Lord Jesus sowed concerning the ground of the children of the kingdom for their walk and work is the matter of fruit brought forth of life Matt 7:15-20 .
[375]  This seed is developed in Galatians 5:22-23: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law."
[376]  This seed is sown by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 7:21 and is developed in Romans 12:2: "And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect."
[377]  For the harvest of the seed of the building, we need to read Revelation 21:10-11, 18-21: "And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.
[378]  Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal....And the building material of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like pure glass.
[379]  In the last chapter we covered the growth and harvest of the reality of the kingdom.
[380]  Romans 16:17-18 says, "Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.
[381]  For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple."
[382]  First Timothy 1:19-20 says, "Holding faith and a good conscience; which some having put away, concerning the faith have made shipwreck: of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
[383]  Do you think that Alexander and Hymeneus were real Christians?
[384]  The tares are further developed in 1 John 2:18-19: "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
[385]  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
[386]  Now let us read Revelation 2:2b: "You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false."
[387]  Have you ever realized that there are so many verses in the New Testament concerning the tares?
[388]  Now we need to see the evil things which are contained within the great Babylon.
[389]  In 1 Corinthians 5:1-2 more leaven is mentioned: "It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
[390]  And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
[391]  Ephesians 4:14 indicates that even teachings from the Bible may become a kind of leaven if used improperly.
[392]  "That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error."
[393]  First Timothy 1:3-4 says, "As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
[394]  We can see more leaven in the book of Titus.
[395]  In 1:10-11 it says, "For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."
[396]  Then we need to read Revelation 17:4-5: "And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication; and upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth."
[397]  This woman held a golden cup, but within it were abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.
[398]  Now we need to see something concerning the kingdom from the book of Hebrews.
[399]  With the exception of Matthew and Revelation, Hebrews has more related to the kingdom than any other book in the New Testament.
[400]  Most Christians have never considered that Hebrews is a book on the kingdom.
[401]  The Old Testament contains many types of the spiritual things revealed in the New Testament.
[402]  It reveals that Christ is superior to every item of Judaism.
[403]  The second section of the book, which is mainly chapters three and four, tells us that Christ is far superior to Moses and Joshua.
[404]  Both Moses and Joshua were sent by God to lead His people, but Christ is superior to both of them.
[405]  Moses was sent by God as an apostle, and Christ is also sent by God; He is our Apostle, our Leader.
[406]  In 1 Corinthians 9 the Apostle Paul compared the Christian life to a race.
[407]  Let us also read Hebrews 6:1-2: "Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment."
[408]  Here the Apostle Paul says we need to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and be brought on to maturity.
[409]  Now let us read Hebrews 6:7-8: "For the earth which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; but bringing forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned."
[410]  If we do not leave the foundation and go on to experience more of Christ, we are like a piece of ground which drinks the rain, but does not bring forth the proper fruit.
[411]  Hebrews 10:26 says, "For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins."
[412]  Some Christian teachers have taught inaccurately that this verse means if we sin willfully we cannot be forgiven.
[413]  Chapter twelve shows us that we should lay aside every weight and run the race.
[414]  If you fall while running the race, you should simply rise to your feet and continue running the race.
[415]  The harvest of the kingdom is in the book of Revelation.
[416]  In chapters two and three of Revelation, in those epistles to the seven churches, the Lord Jesus issued a call to the overcomers.
[417]  In His calling to the overcomers, the Lord Jesus revealed the proper condition of the church which is for the kingdom.
[418]  In 2:4 the Lord said to the church in Ephesus, "But I have this against you, that you have left your first love."
[419]  If we all return to our first love for the Lord, surely the persecution will come.
[420]  Following Pergamos, which indicates an illegal marriage of the church to the world, comes Thyatira.
[421]  The church in Sardis represents the church of the Reformation.
[422]  In the New Testament, there are three major books on the kingdom: Matthew, Hebrews, and Revelation.
[423]  The book of Hebrews starts and ends with the kingdom.
[424]  Hebrews 1:8 says, "But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom."
[425]  Revelation continues with the church in the reality of the kingdom and ends with the kingdom in its manifestation.
[426]  In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus said, "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you."
[427]  Matthew 19:23-24 mentions both of these kinds of kingdoms: "And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[428]  And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
[429]  Matthew 21:43 also mentions the kingdom of God: "Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it."
[430]  Matthew 13:41 speaks of the kingdom of the Son of Man: "The Son of Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all stumblingblocks and those who do lawlessness."
[431]  Ephesians 5:5 mentions the kingdom of Christ and of God: "For this you know, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or person of unbridled greedy lust, who is an idolator, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
[432]  The kingdom of the Son of David is also mentioned in Luke 1:32-33: "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[433]  The kingdom of the heavens is divided into two periods: the period of its appearance and reality, and the period of its manifestation.
[434]  In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus did not say, "the kingdom of the heavens was likened to."
[435]  This is because the appearance and reality of the kingdom of the heavens began from the event spoken of in the parable of the tares, that is, the happenings at Pentecost.
[436]  In Matthew 16:18-19, after the Lord Jesus said that He would build His church, He also said that He would give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter.
[437]  The Bible shows us that the kingdom of God embraces a wide scope: it embraces eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, Adam in the garden and the chosen patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, today's church, the millennium and the kingdom of the heavens in the future, and the new heaven and the new earth, which are eternal and without ending.
[438]  Daniel 7:13-14 shows that the kingdom which the Lord Jesus is bringing with Him at His second coming is the eternal kingdom which God will set up on the earth Dan 2:44 , and which is received from the Ancient of Days Luke 19:12, 15 , and belongs to the Ancient of Days, that is, to God.
[439]  First Corinthians 15:24 says that at the end, that is, at the end of the millennium, when Christ will have destroyed all the power of Satan, He will deliver up the kingdom to God.
[440]  This proves that after the millennium, during the time of the new heaven and the new earth, the kingdom of God will still exist.
[441]  Therefore, the new heavens and the new earth in the future are also a part of the kingdom of God.
[442]  Therefore, according to the Scriptures, the kingdom of God stretches from eternity to eternity, without beginning and without ending.
[443]  The millennium refers to the time after Christ comes again as King to rule the world and before the new heaven and new earth Rev 20:4-6 .
[444]  All of the believers who are being disciplined in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will enter into the heavenly portion of the millennium in the future to enjoy the glory and gladness of the kingdom and reign with the Lord as kings over the nations for a thousand years.
[445]  Therefore, the millennium is the period of Christ reigning over the world as King, while the kingdom of the heavens referring to the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly portion of the millennium in which Christ and the overcoming saints will reign as kings over the world Rev 2:26-27; 20:4-6; 2 Tim 2:12; Luke 19:17, 19 .
[446]  The kingdom which the Lord, the Messiah, will restore the kingdom of Messiah or the kingdom of Israel to be restored in the future Acts 1:6 is the earthly portion of the millennium, "the tabernacle of David" which the Lord will rebuild Acts 15:16 , and the kingdom which God has prepared from the foundation of the world for the "sheep" that are to be the people on the earth during the millennium Matt 25:32-34 .
[447]  The heavens spoken of here refer to the third heavens where God and the Lord Jesus dwell.
[448]  The kingdom of the heavens is a kingdom, the ruling of the heavens today, wherein the seeking believers are submitting to the heavenly authority and receiving the heavenly discipline, control, and training.
[449]  The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens has a very wide scope, including all who are called Christians, regardless of whether they are real or false.
[450]  Not all of those who are in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are in the church because not all of them are saved.
[451]  Why then did the scope of these three parts become different?
[452]  Why is the scope of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens wider than the scope of the church and the kingdom of God?
[453]  If Satan had not brought in the false believers and if the real believers had not become degraded, then the scope of the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God, and the church would be the same.
[454]  Although the defeated ones and the believers who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens are both in the church and in the kingdom of God, and are inseparable, yet the defeated ones have lost the heavenly position of the church and have neglected the divine life of the kingdom of God.
[455]  May we not lose the heavenly position of the church nor neglect the divine life of the kingdom of God, but be disciplined in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today so that we may reign with Him in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future.
[456]  When the Lord Jesus turned the kingdom of the heavens to the church, He brought a group of people out of the world to be under the heavenly control.
[457]  Through regeneration all the Christians have been brought into the kingdom of the heavens.
[458]  This means that all Christians by their regeneration have been brought under the control of the heavens.
[459]  They were brought into the kingdom by their new birth, but they did not continue practically in the kingdom by being willing to be controlled by the heavenly rule.
[460]  In Romans 14:17 the Apostle Paul says, "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
[461]  In dealing with ourselves we must be righteous; with others we must have peace; before God we must have joy.
[462]  Some have taught in the past that although you are defeated now, when the Lord Jesus comes back you will be treated the same as the overcoming, victorious ones, and you will go into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to be a king with the Lord.
[463]  When the Lord Jesus comes back surely the Apostle Paul will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens and rule as a king with the Lord Jesus, because he had already been living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.
[464]  When the Lord Jesus comes back, the Apostle Paul will inherit the manifestation of the kingdom.
[465]  The phrase, "Then shall the kingdom of the heavens," indicates that the previous discourse is also related to the kingdom of the heavens.
[466]  When the Lord Jesus returns, all the dead saints will be resurrected, and those who are ready will enjoy the marriage feast.
[467]  In other words, as the Lord's crop 1 Cor 3:9, lit.
[468]  , they are matured and ripe, so they are ready to enter into the marriage feast of the Lamb.
[469]  The second parable in Matthew 25, the parable of the talents, shows the same principle.
[470]  Let us read from verse 22: "And he also who received the two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents.
[471]  And he also who received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.
[472]  CHAPTER FORTY-NINE THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:12-15; Luke 12:42-47; Matt 24:37-51; 25:1-13; Acts 14:22; John 3:5; 1 Cor 5:1, 5; 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5; Gal 5:19-21; 2 Thes 1:5; 1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:13-15; 2 Tim 4:1, 6-8, 18 THE ETERNAL LIFE OF GOD
[473]  As we pointed out in a previous chapter, the first gospel preaching, preached both by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus, was concerning the kingdom of the heavens.
[474]  The kingdom is also related to the wisdom and justice of God.
[475]  Now let us read Luke 12:42-47: "And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?
[476]  We must realize there are four dispensations, or ages, in which the Lord will accomplish His work.
[477]  There was the age of Adam to Moses Rom 5:14 , the age of Moses to Christ John 1:17 , the age of the church, and the age of the millennium.
[478]  Many verses in the New Testament show the need of exercise for the kingdom.
[479]  Acts 14:22 says, "Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
[480]  John 3:5 simply says that by being born of water and of the Spirit we can enter into the kingdom of God.
[481]  Amen...I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing...I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom."
[482]  But whether or not we will be able to share in the manifestation of the kingdom is the problem.
[483]  Nearly all of the writers of the New Testament, including Paul, John, and Peter, had something to say about the kingdom.
[484]  Luke also said something, and James, even in his short book, has a very sweet verse concerning the kingdom.
[485]  "Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
[486]  In such a sweet, dear, and precious way Peter tells us how we can enter into the kingdom.
[487]  Second Peter 1:1 and 3 say, "Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ...According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue."
[488]  On the one hand I advise you and encourage you and charge you to seek after the kingdom.
[489]  But on the other hand I want to share with you that the wonderful way for you to enter into the kingdom is by developing all the items within you step by step 2 Pet 1:5-11 .
[490]  By this kind of development Peter says that we will have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of Christ.
[491]  The Lord's eternal purpose is to have a kingdom.
