<h1 class="title">The Essence and Glory of the New Covenant Ministry</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:7-11, 18; 4:4, 6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The new covenant ministry has an essence in two aspects&mdash;the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness&mdash;2 Cor. 3:8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit who gives life (vv. 8, 6), because the new covenant brings in God&rsquo;s righteousness unto life (Rom. 5:18, 21); hence, the new covenant ministry is also a ministry of righteousness.</li>
	<li>As the old covenant ministry was of death and condemnation, so the new covenant ministry is of the Spirit and of righteousness; death is versus life, which is embodied in the Spirit, and condemnation is versus righteousness.</li>
	<li>The Spirit and righteousness are the two aspects of an essence which is inscribed into us by the ministry of the new covenant; this Spirit and this righteousness are the essence of the new covenant ministry&mdash;2 Cor. 3:8-9.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s view of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ&mdash;vv. 2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As indicated by <em>with</em> in verse 3, the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence used in the writing.</li>
		<li>A divine essence has been written into our being, and this essence is the Spirit:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The unique essence which needs to be inscribed into the saints is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</li>
			<li>The new covenant ministry inscribes the Spirit into us, that is, this ministry adds more of the essence of God into us.</li>
			<li>The essence of the Spirit inscribed into us is life&mdash;v. 6; 4:12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Based upon the principle that the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is an essence, righteousness is also an essence&mdash; v. 9; 5:21.</li>
	<li>The ministry of the new covenant inscribes an essence into our being, an essence that has an inner aspect and an outer aspect; the inner aspect is the living Spirit moving in us, and the outer aspect is righteousness as our expression&mdash;3:3, 8-9.</li>
	<li>The goal of the new covenant ministry is to minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit inwardly and as the living righteousness outwardly.</li>
	<li>The Spirit and righteousness are both related to our expressing the image of God (v. 18); the reason for this is that the Spirit and righteousness are both God Himself:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The central vision of the Bible is related to the image of God expressed by the life of God&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:9; Rev. 4:3; 21:10-11; 22:1-2, 14.</li>
		<li>God as the Spirit is moving in us as a substance and living in us as an essence, for He Himself has been added into our being by the new covenant ministry.</li>
		<li>The righteousness we express outwardly is also God Himself, for we have God as our righteousness, and this righteousness becomes our appearance, our expression.</li>
		<li>Righteousness is the outward expression of the Christ who lives in us as the life-giving Spirit:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This righteousness is God&rsquo;s image&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
			<li>The new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Lord&rsquo;s image&mdash;2 Cor. 3:9, 18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To say that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness is equal to saying that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of God&mdash; vv. 8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit is God within us living, moving, and acting, and righteousness is God expressed to become our appearance outwardly.</li>
		<li>Since the Spirit inwardly and the righteousness outwardly are God Himself, the ministry of the new covenant, a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, is a ministry of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whereas the old covenant ministry came about in glory and was through glory, the new covenant ministry is in glory and abounds in glory&mdash;vv. 7-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 3:7-11 we see the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of the old covenant, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The glory of the new covenant ministry is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God shining Himself in the hearts of the apostles&mdash; v. 8; 4:6.</li>
		<li>With the old covenant ministry, there was glorification; with the new covenant ministry, there is the glory itself, even the surpassing glory&mdash;3:10.</li>
		<li>The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory but also abounds with the glory of God&mdash; v. 9.</li>
		<li>The glory of the new covenant ministry does not come to visit us&mdash;it comes to remain in us and to shine out from within our being; this glory comes first to invade, pervade, permeate, soak, and saturate us and then to shine forth from within us&mdash;4:4, 6; 3:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The glory of the new covenant ministry is the resurrected Christ&mdash;Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The resurrected Christ is Himself the glory of the new covenant&mdash;John 7:39; 17:1, 5; Luke 24:26; Acts 3:13; Rom. 6:4.</li>
		<li>Glory, which is an essence, is intimately related to the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The glory in verse 18 is equal to the Lord Spirit; thus, the glory actually is the Spirit.</li>
			<li>Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit&mdash; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>The glory of the new covenant, being the resurrected Christ, is the Spirit.</li>
			<li>The glory, the Spirit, and resurrection all refer to the same thing.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;the glory of the new covenant ministry&mdash;is now shining in us all&mdash;2 Cor. 4:4, 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
