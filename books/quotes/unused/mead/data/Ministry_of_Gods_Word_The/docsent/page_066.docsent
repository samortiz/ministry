   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Release of the Spirit Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Release of Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The release of the spirit is also the release of power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether or not a stubborn man will be subdued depends on the amount of spiritual power that is released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If our spirit is strong, he will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as a person is not completely closed which makes it impossible to do anything , he will be subdued when your spirit is released in a powerful way, even if such a person is very stubborn by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should never put all of the blame on others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nine out of ten times the problem is probably with us, not with others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our spirit is powerful enough, we will subdue them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more power our spirit releases, the more others will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Release of the Spirit Being</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Release of Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The release of the Spirit is also the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the spirit is released, the Holy Spirit is released, power is released, and life is released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether or not others will touch spiritual reality when they listen to us depends on the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether or not they will touch life also depends on the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we merely release the word, others will only touch doctrine; they will not touch the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when we stand up to speak and willingly and voluntarily push out the Holy Spirit, others will not only hear doctrine; they will touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether or not others touch the outward shell of the word or the life within the word depends on whether we have pushed out the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Release of the Spirit Being</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>the Release of Light</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The release of the spirit is also the release of light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Light first becomes the word in us, and then it becomes light in others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, light becomes the word in us, and then through our spirit the word becomes light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether or not a man sees light is not his responsibility with the exception of those who are prejudiced but the responsibility of the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not a man opens his eyes is his own responsibility, but having opened his eyes, whether or not he sees light is the responsibility of the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A man is responsible only for opening his eyes; the minister is responsible for giving him the light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man decides to close his eyes, nothing can be done about it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if a man opens his heart, eyes, and spirit and does not see anything, the responsibility rests with the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the spirit of the minister is strong in the release of the word and if the Holy Spirit goes forth with the word, the word will become light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s light is embodied in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In delivering God s word, we release the spirit, and we also release the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When this word reaches man, it becomes light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man kneels down and prays after hearing the word, saying, Lord, grant me light, he has only heard doctrine; he has not heard God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s word is light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When one hears God s word, he sees light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man should not need to kneel down and pray after hearing a message.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He should not need to say, I understand this message, but I do not have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, give me the light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If one has to ask for light after he has understood a message, it means that the message and the light are still two separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is where Christianity has failed: Doctrines do not bring light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything is clearly explained, but nothing avails.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everyone can say it, but no one can apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must remember that when a man hears God s word, he sees light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man hears God s word but does not see light, the responsibility rests on the shoulder of the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We often put the responsibility of seeing on the shoulder of the listener.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Other than exceptional frustrations and closedness on the part of the listener, the speaker has to be responsible for the lack of light in a message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people have an open spirit, a seeking heart, and an open mind; they want to receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the light does not come, it means that something is wrong with the ministry of the word; the frustration is with the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the spirit is active while the word is released and if the Holy Spirit operates while this is going on, the word will become light to the hearer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A man will no longer need to ask for light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He will not need to kneel down and pray, Lord, I have heard this word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now give me the light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As he hears the word, he will receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some ministers should repent before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have no light to give to others; it is locked up in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a problem on the part of the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is most unjust for ministers to blame the poverty in the church on the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers and sisters are responsible for opening their eyes, while the ministers are responsible for giving them light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever the spirit of the ministers is released, light is released.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A minister can determine the amount of light he will release.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He can determine before the Lord how much light he will give to others on a certain day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He should be a man who has passed through dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When he pushes out his spirit, he should push out what he sees, the revelations in his spirit and the light within him, together with his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has to push out his spirit, like a man being pushed out through a door.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has to push out the light.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He must release the light not only in a way that seeks understanding but in a way that causes men to fall on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Often, a minister is prepared to release light only for the purpose of helping others to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a result, others may understand but have nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A worker often pays attention only to the audience s understanding; his only motive and desire are for his audience to understand his word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if he is willing to pay the price before the Lord, he will push out his spirit in such a way that his word will release light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The light will be so strong that others will understand not only the words, but they will be subdued by it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They will fall in the face of such light.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Light can make a man fall down on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once a man sees light, he will fall down; he will prostrate himself on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is something the ministers should do before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is an adequate willingness on the part of the ministers, light will be released in a strong way.</S>
