   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT, THE REALITY,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE CHARACTERISTIC, OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN THE BOOK OF PSALMS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 19:10 says that the spirit of the prophecy of the book of Revelation is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Based upon this principle we can say that the spirit, the reality, the characteristic, of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is Christ Luke 24:44 as the centrality and universality of the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this, He is firstly the embodiment of the Triune God, then the house, the habitation, of God signified by the temple , the kingdom of God signified by the city of Jerusalem , and the Ruler of the entire earth from the house of God and in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, He is all in all in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a divine revelation is the same as what is revealed in the entire Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only particular point of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is that such a high revelation, even the highest peak of the divine revelation, is prophesied in the expressions of the sentiments of the ancient godly saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So it is mixed with their comfort in sufferings and the cultivation of godliness, yet the center and the reality, the spirit, of this highest revelation is not the comfort in sufferings nor the cultivation of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the Christ of God, who is all in all according to God's desire and for God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The consummation of this highest divine revelation is the city of New Jerusalem as a sign of the habitation, the tabernacle, of God Rev 21:1-3 , through which the Triune God is manifested and expressed in the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God desires to have an organic habitation on earth, and this habitation is the aggregate of the living saints gained by God through the terminating death and germinating resurrection of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will be the eternal manifestation and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God, and He will be everything to them in His all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God will reign on the new earth through such an organism in the new universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the spirit, the extract, of the book of Psalms.</S>
