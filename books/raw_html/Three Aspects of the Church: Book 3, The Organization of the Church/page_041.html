	 <h2 class="head2">To Be Heavenly Being<br />
to Submit to the Authority of God</h2>
<p>The main significance of the church being heavenly is that it is under God&rsquo;s authority. The nature of the church is to submit to God&rsquo;s authority. Water is not viscous, but oil is. Hence, viscosity is the nature of oil. In the same way, heaven also has a nature. Its nature is to submit to God&rsquo;s authority. <em>Heaven,</em> as spoken of in the Bible, strongly implies submission to God&rsquo;s authority. To further illustrate the different natures of things, let us consider the difference between the pliable nature of a handkerchief and the rigid nature of a piece of chalk. If a person attempts to fold a piece of chalk, it will snap. This is because its nature cannot withstand folding. However, if a person folds a handkerchief, it will not snap like the chalk. This is because its nature can withstand folding. Hence, the difference in nature between a piece of chalk and a handkerchief is that one can be folded easily and the other cannot.</p>
<p>In order to submit to God&rsquo;s authority, His creatures must have the nature of heaven. They must be heavenly. In the universe only the heavens submit to God&rsquo;s authority. The particular nature of heaven is that it submits to God&rsquo;s authority. Wherever heaven is, God&rsquo;s authority is there. Hence, to be heavenly is to have the nature of submitting to God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>Apart from the Spirit of God, we cannot touch the life of God. God&rsquo;s life is in the Spirit. If we want to touch God&rsquo;s life, we must touch the Spirit of God. Hence, the Spirit of God is God&rsquo;s life. In the same principle, God&rsquo;s authority is in heaven. Thus, heaven represents God&rsquo;s authority. The prodigal son in Luke 15:18 said, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.&rdquo; This implies that when a sinner commits sins, he sins against heaven; that is, he sins before God the Father who is in heaven. When a sinner sins, he offends God and violates God&rsquo;s authority. Since God&rsquo;s authority is in heaven, whenever a sinner touches God&rsquo;s authority, he touches heaven. God&rsquo;s ruling is heaven&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
<p>The primary significance of the church&rsquo;s being heavenly is that the church is under God&rsquo;s authority. The nature of the church involves submission to God&rsquo;s authority. According to its nature, a handkerchief is pliable because it is soft. If a handkerchief is not pliable, something is wrong with it. Likewise, according to its nature, the church submits to God&rsquo;s authority. Thus, it is not difficult for the church to submit to God&rsquo;s authority. If the church does not submit to God&rsquo;s authority, something must be wrong with the church. The church&rsquo;s submission to God&rsquo;s authority is due to her heavenly nature.</p>
<p>Most people understand heaven as a blessing. Many Christians think that once they &ldquo;go to heaven,&rdquo; they will enjoy peace and blessings. They even sing about it. This thought is entirely from the Roman Catholic Church. Their basis is Revelation 7. However, Revelation 21:2 says that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God. People think that they will to go to heaven, but the Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven. Not only will men not go to heaven, but heaven will come down to the earth. Man pays much attention to going to heaven, but God pays attention to the earth. Some men dream all day long about going to heaven, but God is concerned only with coming down to the earth.</p>
<p>The source of the concept of the blessing and happiness of heaven is entirely something of the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church uses the superstition of the blessing of heaven to distract people. Many teachings in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism are similar to this. However, we who believe in the Lord must see that in the Bible heaven is a matter of authority.</p>
<p>There is a difference between being heavenly and being earthy. They are altogether two different natures. One is glorious, and the other is lowly. One is of God, and the other is not of God. Although everything that is with God and is heavenly is blessed, joyous, peaceful, and bright, the emphasis in the Bible is that heaven is the place entrusted with God&rsquo;s authority. To nullify heaven is to nullify God&rsquo;s authority. Therefore, the Bible says that the heavens do rule (Dan. 4:26). The ultimate dwelling place of God is the earth. The New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven. Hence, heaven is a place not for enjoying blessing but for ruling.</p>
<p>Since heaven is related to God&rsquo;s authority, Satan also attempts to usurp it. Ephesians 6:12 speaks of the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. This shows that Satan is the ruler of the authority of the air (2:2) who rebels against God and attempts to encroach upon God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s enemy encroaches in the sphere of God&rsquo;s authority in the air; thus, spiritual warfare is a matter of being heavenly and having authority. It is not a matter of blessing. For the church to be heavenly means that it is under God&rsquo;s authority. Only when the church is under God&rsquo;s authority can it deal with the enemy who encroaches upon God&rsquo;s authority. This is altogether not a matter of blessing but a matter of warfare, and it is not a matter of peace or joy but a matter of authority.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;Does not Ephesians 1:3 speak of the blessings in the heavenlies?&rdquo; If we read the context carefully, we will realize that these blessings are not peace or joy but the Father&rsquo;s choosing, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing. Certainly, all these items are heavenly, but we should not forget that heaven takes God&rsquo;s authority as its center. The primary significance of heaven is God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
