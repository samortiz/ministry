<h2 class="head2">D. The Sins of Israel<br />
and the Punishments of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
concerning Israel&rsquo;s Stubbornness</h2>
<p>Hosea 4:15-19 is concerned with Israel&rsquo;s stubbornness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Israel Going About as a Harlot</h2>
<p>Israel went about as a harlot, but Judah was charged not to transgress and not to come to Gilgal, nor to go up to Beth-aven, nor to swear, &ldquo;As Jehovah lives&rdquo; (v. 15). Gilgal was the focus of idolatry (9:15; 12:11; Amos 4:4; 5:5). Beth-aven means &ldquo;house of nothingness&rdquo; or &ldquo;house of idolatry.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel Being Stubborn, like a Stubborn Heifer</h2>
<p>Israel was stubborn, like a stubborn heifer (Hosea 4:16a), which is disobedient and goes its own way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah Limiting Israel in a Narrow Field</h2>
<p>In verse 16b the prophet asks, &ldquo;Will Jehovah now pasture them / Like a lamb in a spacious place?&rdquo; This indicates that Jehovah would limit Israel in a narrow field.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Ephraim Being Joined to Idols</h2>
<p>In verse 17a we are told that Ephraim was joined to idols.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Ephraim Being Left Alone</h2>
<p>In 4:17b the prophet gives a charge concerning Ephraim: &ldquo;Leave him alone.&rdquo; Ephraim was to be let go. This indicates a kind of punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Their Liquor Having Ended,<br />
and They Having Given Themselves Up to Harlotry</h2>
<p>Their liquor had ended (v. 18a), meaning that their pleasure in drinking was gone. That was God&rsquo;s punishment. They had given themselves up to harlotry; their rulers dearly loved shame (v. 18b). They were fond of drinking and harlotry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Wind Having Wrapped Her Up in Its Wings</h2>
<p>Verse 19a says that the wind had wrapped her up in its wings. It had carried her away&mdash;a kind of punishment. According to verse 19b, they would be ashamed because of their sacrifices (to idols&mdash;v. 13a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Sins of Israel<br />
and the Punishments of Jehovah&mdash;<br />
Mainly concerning the Priests,<br />
the House of the King, and the Princes</h2>
<p>In 5:1-14 and 6:4-10 we have more details about the sins of Israel and the punishments of Jehovah&mdash;mainly concerning the priests, the house of the king, and the princes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah&rsquo;s Judgment Coming<br />
upon the Priests, upon the House of Israel,<br />
and upon the House of the King</h2>
<p>In 5:1-2 we are told that upon the priests, upon the house of Israel, and upon the house of the king Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment would come, for they had been a snare and a net for slaughtering, even though Jehovah had chastised them all.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ephraim Having Gone About as a Harlot,<br />
and Israel Being Defiled</h2>
<p>Ephraim had gone about as a harlot, and Israel was defiled. A spirit of harlotries was within them (or, in the midst of them). Their doings did not permit them to turn to their God, and they did not know Jehovah (vv. 3-4).</p>
