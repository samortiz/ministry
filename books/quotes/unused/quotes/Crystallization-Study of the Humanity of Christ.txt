Especially they do not pay full attention to the prophecy concerning Christ as a man in His humanity in the Old Testament
In these messages the culture and language are new, so we have to pay our full attention to the wording of the outlines
Isaiah 9:6 says that a child is born to us and a son is given to us whose name is Mighty God and Eternal Father
As the seed of woman in His humanity Christ opened the closed way for sinners to take God as the tree of life the source of the divine life
After man's fall the way to the tree of life was closed due to the requirements of God's glory, righteousness, and holiness
Christ as the seed of Abraham needed to bear the curse of the law so that the redeemed sinners could be blessed
As the seed of David, in His humanity, Christ builds up the temple of God, the church of God, to be God's dwelling place on the earth
As the seed of David, in His humanity, He is the King of the kingdom of God for the consummation of God's eternal economy
Christ in His humanity is the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and also the branch of Jesse, the father of David
In the millennium through Christ as the branch of Jesse, all the creatures of God will live in peaceful harmony
We want to continue our fellowship concerning the humanity of Christ in the prophecy concerning the eternal economy of God
In our crystallization-study of Song of Songs, we saw that God came as a 'country man' in order to court a 'country girl'
If God had remained only in His divinity, there would have been no possibility for a man to deal with God in this way
His touching of the hollow of Jacobs thigh transformed Jacob a heelholder into Israel the prince of God for the carrying out of Gods economy
Christ, as a man in His humanity, met Joshua as the Captain of Jehovah's army to fight for Israel for the carrying out of God's economy
Joshua was a general, the commander of God's army, fighting not only for Israel but also for the carrying out of God's eternal economy
Now we have to find out why Christ needed to be a man to visit Abraham, wrestle with Jacob, meet Joshua, and come to Manoah's wife
The answer to this question brings us to the unique and deepest truth in the divine revelation of the holy Scriptures
For God to carry out His economy to have this incorporation, a constitution of God and man, man needs to be mingled with God
God needs man to match Him, to be united with Him, to be mingled with Him, to be incorporated into one incorporation with Him
Although this prophecy will be fulfilled in the millennium, we need to realize that today the church life is a minor millennium
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
In Ezekiel 40 43 Christ, as a man in His humanity, measured the holy building of God for His possession among Israel in the millennium
When he looked into the midst of the fire Nebuchadnezzar said I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they are not harmed
Christ, as a man in His humanity, was with Israel in the suffering of their dispersion for God's eternal economy
Christ as a man would be a wall of fire around Jerusalem for her protection and the glory within her for His expression
The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium
Psalm 80:15 and 17 say, 'Even the stock which Your right hand has planted/And the son which You have strengthened for Yourself
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,/Upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself'
These two verses refer to the oneness of Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, with the children of Israel
Daniel 7:13-14 says, 'Behold, with the clouds of heaven,/One like a Son of Man was coming;/And He came to the Ancient of Days
His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away;/And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed'
In the following set of three messages we want to see the humanity of Christ in the fulfillment of Gods eternal economy in the New Testament
In the same way, Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh
Christ Himself is the grace to be gained and enjoyed by us and the reality to be realized and experienced by us
At that time we also will be transfigured to be the same in body as He is, that is, we will be conformed to the body of His glory
Christ's death through the shedding of His blood ministers to His believers eternal life and makes Him one with them
Through His death He initiated for us a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies through the splitting of His crucifixion
Our crystallization-study of the humanity of Christ is to show us how much Christ is to us and how much we can enjoy Christ
Our circumstances in our living can be like a blowing wind, and sometimes they can be like a tempest with heavy rain
Also, in Daniel 10:4-19, we see that Christ is our stability, but we do not have such a thought pointed out in this way in the New Testament
In the outlines for this message and the next one, we have extracted all the New Testament verses which speak of the Son of Man
As the Son of Man, Christ had no place to lay His head , not even as the foxes having holes nor as the birds of heaven having roosts
The Son of Man was buried in His humanity in the heart of the earth three days and three nights as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish
The entire Bible also ends in this way, that is, with Christ Himself as the Son of Man being a heavenly ladder
The conclusion and totality of these three ins is the Spirit of reality, who is Christ Himself, to be the reality within us
The three of the Triune God the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father are constituted and incorporated with the believers
Now we want to conclude our fellowship concerning the revelation of the humanity of Christ in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God
Because a member of His Body was suffering on this earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God
Revelation 1:11-13 shows that Christ as the Son of Man is taking care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity
As the High Priest He is dressing the churches as the lampstands to cherish them, to make them happy, bright, and shining
He is also caring for the churches with His divinity as the energy motivated by His love signified by the golden girdle on His breast
The watchful ones, the ready ones, will see Him as the morning star and be taken by Him in the early part of His secret coming back
He will be ashamed of the people who were ashamed of Him and His words in this adulterous and sinful generation
He will appear in heaven on the clouds with power and great glory to be seen by all the mourning tribes of the earth
He will judge all the dead people to decide who should be resurrected at His coming and who should be resurrected one thousand years later
The goats who have ill-treated the Jews and the believers in the great tribulation will go into eternal punishment to perish
Later, the Lord as the Son of Man will judge all the dead people who will be resurrected unto judgment after the millennium
Christ will reign in His humanity in the millennium, sitting on the throne of His glory with His faithful followers
For eternity Christ as the Son of Man will bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven as the ladder seen by Jacob
The Son of Man is the ladder as the uplifted standing stairway for the traffic of the ascending and descending angels in eternity future
That will be the mutual abiding of God in us and us in God to have God's glory manifested in humanity radiantly
Although Christ was slain less than two thousand years ago, Revelation 13:8 says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world
According to the fact, God reckons Christ as the Firstborn of God's old creation so that Christ might be the first in everything
Eventually, the centrality and universality of the entire universe, signified by the New Jerusalem, is Christ as the Son of Man
