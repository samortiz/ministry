<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO BUILD UP THE SERVICES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (12)</H1><P>Date:January 23, 1948<br>Place:Brother Chia's home, Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN COOPERATING WITH GOD,<br>ALLOWING GOD TO HAVE A WAY IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>Today, man must give God adequate cooperation before He can have a way in the church. The channels must be cut deep before the water can flow to all the places. In the same way, a person must pass through deep digging before God's grace can have the opportunity to flow into the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ARRANGEMENTS IN THE SERVICES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>First Learning,<br>Then Making Careful Arrangements</H2><P>Concerning assignments for the work in the church, we should allow the brothers and sisters to begin by first learning to serve in one or two specific areas of service, such as gospel preaching. After this, three or four elders can discuss among themselves to see which of the saints are more worthy of trust. These ones should then be invited to a fellowship. If they have some proper suggestions, they should be taken. Once a person has been invited to take up some assignment, we should not easily remove him. There is no need for everyone to answer to everyone else. Once the way is made clear to all, everyone can concentrate on his own work.</P><P>Sister Pearl Wang: For example, in the church in Shanghai, every aspect of the hospitality service has its specific assignments. There are people responsible for the linens, people responsible for the laundry, for patching, for the storage, and for the housekeeping. Everyone has his own duty, and there is no confusion.</P><P>Brother Lee: In the matter of service, we are not afraid of being slow. The only thing we want to avoid is confusion. We are not afraid of being not aggressive. We only want to avoid being too hasty. Once we are confused and hasty, we will not do a good job. At least a year will be needed before the various areas of services in the church in Swatow will have some direction. Other than the work that absolutely requires hiring someone to do it, all the rest should be done by the brothers and sisters themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In the Matter of Service,<br>Learning to Touch God from Within</H2><P>Of course, the most basic thing in the service is to learn to know God and to touch Him from within.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Considering the Saints' Outward Condition</H2><P>Surely there are some difficulties in selecting the right persons to serve. Some who are so-called unpromising should not necessarily be rejected, and some who are promising should not necessarily be taken. To be weak or to be strong does not mean much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Elders First Working Alongside the Saints,<br>Then Entrusting the Work to Them Completely</H2><P>If a work is assigned to an inexperienced one, the elders should first work with such a one alongside him. Up to a certain point, they can entrust the work completely to such a one and allow him to do it on his own.</P>
