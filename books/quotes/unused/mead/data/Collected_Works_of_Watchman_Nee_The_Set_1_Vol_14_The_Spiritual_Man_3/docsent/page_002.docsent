   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION EIGHT THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 2 THE MIND CHAPTER ONE THE MIND A BATTLEFIELD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The mind of man is man's thinking organ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through the mind, we know, think, imagine, recollect, and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The intellectual power, rationality, wisdom, and intelligence of man all belong to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Broadly speaking, our mind is everything related to our brain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mind is the psychological term, while brain is the physiological term.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mind in psychology is the brain in physiology.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mind occupies a big part in man's life because the mind directs man's conduct the most.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEFORE REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Bible, man's mind is a battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is something unique.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the mind Satan and the evil spirits battle with the truth and also battle with the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may use an example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The will and the spirit are like a fortress which evil spirits try to attack and capture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's mind is the field on which the battle takes place and from which the fortress is stormed and taken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The apostle said, "For though we walk in flesh, we do not war according to flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ" 2 Cor 10:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostle first told us about a war, then he told us where this war is and what it is for.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This war is completely related to the mind of man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle likened the "reasonings" to the "enemy's stronghold."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He considered the mind as a stronghold guarded by the enemy that must be "overthrown."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also considered that within this stronghold there are many "rebellious thoughts."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle had to overthrow the mind of man and imprison and "take captive" the "rebellious thoughts" in man's mind, so these thoughts would be brought completely unto the "obedience of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From these verses we can see that the mind of man is a battlefield because this is where evil spirits war with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible tells us that "the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them" 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This agrees with the previously cited Scripture because this is how Satan guards and blinds the mind of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps a man considers himself to be very intelligent, able to use various arguments to oppose the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some think that others do not believe because they do not yet understand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the eyes of men's minds have been covered up by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since men's minds are guarded by Satan, their "thoughts were hardened" 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were "doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath" Eph 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are "enemies in the mind" Col 1:21 because "the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God" Rom 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After reading these verses and seeing how the authority of darkness is especially related to man's mind, we can see that the mind is the part of man which is most easily attacked by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The authority of darkness cannot directly do anything to man's will, emotion, and body unless it has gained quite considerable ground in him already.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The same is not true with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It appears that the mind is the enemy's property already; he does not need any special permission or invitation from man before he can freely work in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostle likens the mind to the enemy's "stronghold," as if to tell us how deeply rooted and firm the relationship between Satan with his evil spirits and the mind of man is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Satan and his evil spirits can make man's mind their stronghold and keep man a prisoner through his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They put man under their authority by utilizing his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They also utilize the imprisoned mind to transmit poison to others, and cause them to rise up in rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot say with certainty how much of the philosophy, logic, knowledge, investigation, research, and science in the world today comes from the power and influence of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But one thing is certain: reasonings that lift themselves up against the knowledge of God are the strongholds of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The proximity of the mind to the authority of darkness is nothing strange.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mankind's first sin was the pursuit of "the knowledge of good and evil."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That knowledge was from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the knowledge mind of mankind is peculiarly compatible with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After reading the Bible carefully and observing the experience of the saints, one can see that all the fellowship between man and Satan with his evil spirits is in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One only needs to consider the temptations from the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All temptations from the devil to man occur in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While it is true that the devil often uses the flesh to arouse man's consent, he always entices man by turning temptations into some kind of thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot separate temptations from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All temptations are given to us through the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since our thoughts have such an "open-door policy" with the authority of darkness, we should know how to guard our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before a man is born again, his thoughts prevent him from knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, God's great power is needed to overthrow the reasonings of man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the time a man is saved, one thing happens or should happen repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Repentance in the original text means nothing other than "a change of mind."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because man is at enmity with God in the mind, God wants man's mind to have a change before He can give life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When man does not believe, his moral nature is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the time he is saved, his mind is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God wants man first to have a change of mind before he receives a new heart because the mind is so united with the devil Acts 11:18 .</S>
