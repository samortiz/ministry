   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIVE THE BELIEVERS THEIR DESIGNATIONS 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to cover the four designations of the believers given in the New Testament: disciples, believers, saints, and Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the believers are designated as disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The term "disciples" is often used in the Gospels and in Acts, but it is not used at all in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 5:1 says, "Seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain; and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Christ sat down on the mountain, His disciples, not the crowds, came to Him to be His audience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, not only the believing Jews but also the discipled nations became His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 5:1 and 2 the Lord Jesus taught the disciples, not the crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The crowds that gathered around Him were the outer circle, but His disciples were the inner circle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These disciples were Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, when they were on the mountain listening to the decree of the kingdom's constitution, they were representatives not of the Jewish people but of the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus told His disciples to go and disciple the nations, that is, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the nations would be converted into disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, both the Jewish and Gentile believers are disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The audience on the mountain, composed mainly of Jews, represented all the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Three other verses that refer to the believers as disciples are Matthew 28:16; Acts 6:1; and 21:16.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew 28:16 says, "The eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus appointed them."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 6:1 tells us that the disciples were multiplying, and 21:16 speaks of disciples from Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these verses indicate that one designation of the believers is that of disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those Who Follow Christ</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Disciples are those who follow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His ministry the Lord Jesus told people to repent, for the kingdom of God has drawn near Mark 1:15; Matt 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When some repented, or had an inclination to go with Him, He said to them, "Follow Me" Matt 4:19; 9:9; 19:21; Luke 9:59 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As disciples, the believers follow the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those Who Learn of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Disciples are also those who learn of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus says, "Take My yoke on you and learn from Me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Discipline is required for both following Christ and learning of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot follow Him or learn of Him without being disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We especially need to be disciplined in order to learn of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Acts 5:14 says, "Believers were all the more being added to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1 Timothy 6:2 Paul gives a charge to slaves whose masters are believers, and in 4:12 he charges Timothy to "be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 2 Corinthians 6:14 Paul exhorts the Corinthian believers not to be "unequally yoked with unbelievers."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in the next verse he asks, "What part has a believer with an unbeliever?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word "unequally" in verse 14 means diversely; it denotes a difference in kind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This refers to Deuteronomy 22:10, which forbids yoking together two different animals, the clean and the unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we, the believers, are the clean ones, whereas the unbelievers are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, believers and unbelievers are diverse peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should not be yoked together, because of the believers' divine nature and holy standing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Corinthians 6:14-16 Paul uses five illustrations to depict the difference between believers and unbelievers: no partnership, no share, between righteousness and lawlessness; no fellowship, no communion, between light and darkness; no harmony, no concord, between Christ and Belial; no part, no portion, held by a believer with an unbeliever; and no agreement, no consent, between the temple of God and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial Satan the Devil , and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We believers are of Christ, and the unbelievers are of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have friendship with unbelievers, that means we are making harmony between Christ and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A believer, however, does not have any part with an unbeliever.</S>
