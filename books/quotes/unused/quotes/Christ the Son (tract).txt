Because of Him God is no longer so distant that we cannot know Him, nor so abstract that we cannot experience Him
When we focus on just three of His statuses, we discover that He is God become man for our enjoyment and for His expression for eternity
Our understanding of God is necessarily based solely on the Bible, for the Bible is the unique record given to man by God concerning Himself
Our rational minds will suggest that there are three Gods, but the pure revelation of the Scriptures tells us that this is not so
All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him ; that is, He possesses the full essence of God with all its unique attributes
He is still the eternal God possessing the divine essence with the divine nature but He is also the perfect man possessing the human nature
Although He partook of blood and flesh as we do, He does not have the sinful element that we have -He is without sin
Christ then was the only begotten Son of God the complete God in His divinity and in His humanity He was the Son of Man the perfect man
On the morning of His resurrection, He declared that His disciples were now His brothers and that His Father was now their Father
Through His resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God , and we who believe in Him became the many brothers, the many sons of God
Today Christ as the only begotten Son in His divinity and as the Son of Man in His humanity is the firstborn Son of God
