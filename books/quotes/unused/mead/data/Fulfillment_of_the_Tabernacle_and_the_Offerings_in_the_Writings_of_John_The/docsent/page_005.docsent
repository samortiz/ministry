   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us go on from the mysteries of the Word and the tabernacle to the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to John 1:29, John the Baptist said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John, of course, did not see a lamb; he saw the Man Jesus walking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But he declared that this One is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 1:1 we first have God and the Logos, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in John 1:14 we have the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Life-study of Exodus we studied the tabernacle in great detail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tabernacle in Exodus is a type of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and this Word, which is God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This flesh is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hallelujah, we have God!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have the tabernacle!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we have the tabernacle, the next crucial matter is to behold the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lamb of God represents all the offerings, for this Lamb is the leading offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in John 1 we have God, we have God's dwelling place, the tabernacle, and we have all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tabernacle signifies that it is possible to enter into God, or we may say that God is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is clearly indicated by the fact that the tabernacle, which signifies God incarnate, has an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the tabernacle with its entrance indicates that God Himself is enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But how can we enter into God as the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the typology in the Old Testament, we enter the tabernacle by means of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament the offerings were the means by which the children of Israel could enter the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the offerings, no one was allowed to come into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that apart from the offerings required by God, no one can enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reason that after the tabernacle in John 1:14 we have the Lamb of God in 1:29 as the unique representative of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 1:29 says that the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away sin from the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The phrase "from the world" in this verse actually means from mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through Satan sin has entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan injected sin, his poisonous nature, into the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lamb of God has come to take away this sin from the world, from mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, through this unique offering it is possible for fallen human beings to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE DOVE, A SYMBOL OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Following the Lamb, we have the dove, which symbolizes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, the Word, the Logos, becomes the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the very One who is the tabernacle is also the offerings represented by the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must go on to see that the One who is the tabernacle and the offerings has become the life-giving Spirit signified by the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This life-giving Spirit is the dove in John 1:32.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Life-study of Exodus we have seen that after the tabernacle and the offerings we have the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ointment in Exodus 30 typifies the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, both the ointment and the dove symbolize the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is important to understand why the ointment is recorded after the tabernacle and the offerings and why the dove is mentioned after the tabernacle and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason for this sequence is that first we need the incarnation, the crucifixion, and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was through resurrection that Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Spirit is symbolized by the dove and by the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should help us to understand why the dove, a sign of the Spirit, must come after the tabernacle and the Lamb, the unique offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The symbols in the Bible are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is true in particular of the Lamb and the dove in John 1.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A lamb is something on earth, and a dove soars in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ as the Lamb was a man walking on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when He became the life-giving Spirit, He became the Spirit in the heavens signified by the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus far in John 1 we have seen four aspects of one wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In eternity past Christ was the Logos, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then in time He became the tabernacle and also the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After becoming all the offerings, He became the life-giving Spirit, the dove from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am pointing out the mysteries of the Logos, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the dove in John chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These are not ordinary words; they are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Logos, the Word, is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Likewise, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the dove all are signs.</S>
