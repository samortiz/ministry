   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REMAINING IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would experience Christ and live Him, we need to remain in an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many of us can testify that by prayer we are brought into the spirit, where we are one with the Lord and take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This experience is so precious that when we are enjoying it, we do not want it to end. We like to remain in spirit to be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, as soon as our time of prayer is over, most of the time we revert to our natural way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are no longer in an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Automatically we begin to try once again to be holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we fail, we repent, confess to the Lord, and resolve to try again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not the way to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, our daily living should be the same as our experience in genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we pray ourselves into the spirit, we are one with the Lord, we enjoy His presence, and we spontaneously live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without exerting any effort, we are holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have no problems and no anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe we all have had experiences like this in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These experiences of genuine prayer should be the model for our daily experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that our experience in our daily life should be the same as that in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, most of the time we live according to the natural life, not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To live Christ it is necessary to persevere in prayer, to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to stay in the atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is our life, we live Him, and we are spontaneously holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have no thought of balancing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of standards, principles, and regulations, we have Christ experientially and in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we are in such an atmosphere of prayer, we are one with Christ, and He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what it means to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The teachings I gave out many years ago about being balanced and subdued did not minister Christ, and they did not bring the saints into direct, living contact with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of refinement, we need a kind of living in which Christ is lived out directly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has not given us holiness, victory, or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has given us Christ as a living, all-inclusive Person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What God desires is this Person, not any virtues or attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, our need is to contact this living Person in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we need to remain in an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do this, we shall live Christ spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, we shall be freed from our culture without trying to adjust or correct ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything other than Christ will fade away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ will be whatever we need: life, light, grace, comfort, health, strength, humility, patience, kindness, meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we have Him, we have all the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, in our experience the Bible becomes living and full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST LIVED OUT FROM WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My burden in this message is that our eyes would be opened to see that what God wants is Christ lived out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His concern is not that we be balanced, but that we be one with Christ and live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God wants us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may be a young person, but you should live Christ, not the life of a typical young person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be balanced, subdued, or refined is not the way to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The way to live Christ is in prayer to contact Christ as the life-giving Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we pray ourselves into an atmosphere of genuine prayer, we shall live Christ spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can testify that this is real and that we all can experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to experience the indwelling Christ is to pray in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not need to pray for a better job or home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That kind of prayer hinders us from experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need the kind of prayer which brings us into contact with the Lord, prayer that causes us to be one with Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we pray in this way, we shall enjoy Christ, experience Him as our life, and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead of trying to be a certain kind of person and instead of trying to live up to certain standards and regulations, we should simply contact Christ, be one with Him, and live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our goal should be to know Christ and Christ alone, not to know what to do or where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we enjoy the Lord and experience Him, He will be our life and we shall live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what Paul means in Philippians 1:21: For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to live Christ, we need to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as we stop praying, we stop living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I wish to point out again and again that only in an atmosphere of prayer is it possible to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, every aspect of our daily living must be brought into such an atmosphere, where we and Christ are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this atmosphere Christ is real, substantial, practical, and even touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is in this atmosphere that Christ is our life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here we live Him and enjoy all He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This Christ is unsearchable and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In our experience we are one with Him, we contact Him, and we enjoy all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way we spontaneously live Christ.</S>
