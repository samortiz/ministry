(Hymns, #158)</h2><p>Lord, Thy love has sought and found us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wand'ring in this desert wide;<br />Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us suffered, bled, and died.<br />Sing, my soul! He lovèd thee,<br />Jesus gave Himself for me.<br /><br />Hark! what sounds of bitter weeping<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yon lonesome garden sweep;<br />'Tis the Lord His vigil keeping,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While His followers sink in sleep.<br />Ah, my soul, He lovèd thee,<br />Yes, He gave Himself for me.<br /><br />He is speaking to His Father,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasting deep that bitter cup,<br />Yet He takes it, willing rather<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our sakes to drink it up.<br />Oh, what love! He lovèd me!<br />Gave Himself, my soul, for thee.<br /><br />Then that closing scene of anguish:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All God's waves and billows roll<br />Over Him, there left to languish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cross, to save my soul.<br />Matchless love! how vast, how free,<br />Jesus gave Himself for me.<br /><br />Hark again! His cries are waking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoes on dark Calvary's hill;<br />God, my God, art Thou forsaking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him who always did Thy will?<br />Ah, my soul! it was for thee,<br />Yes! He gave Himself for me.<br /><br />Lord, we joy, Thy toils are ended,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad Thy suff'ring time is o'er;<br />To Thy Father's throne ascended,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There Thou liv'st, to die no more.<br />Yes, my soul, He lives for thee,<br />He who gave Himself for me.<br /><br />Lord, we worship and adore Thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Thy rich, Thy matchless grace;<br />Perfect soon in joy before Thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall see Thee face to face.<br />Yet e'en now our song shall be,<br />Jesus gave Himself for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></table></div>
