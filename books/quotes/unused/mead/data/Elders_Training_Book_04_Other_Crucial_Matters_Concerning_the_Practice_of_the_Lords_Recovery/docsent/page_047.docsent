   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH A SINNING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the elders who are taking care of the church deal with some sinning ones, they should not condemn his family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this sinning one is a brother, we should only deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not consider his entire family as victims.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, when we deal with a sinning brother, we must love his wife and love his children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this brother would not repent after a long, long period of patience on the elders' side and if he would not give up his sinning life, this would force the church to remove him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not include his wife or his children in your dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, you must love the wife and the children even more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not so easy or simple to take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>NOT TRUSTING IN MAN BUT IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not think that you should be able to fully trust in your helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord Jesus selected the twelve, He selected Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that one of the lessons indicated by the Lord here is that we should not hope to have helpers in whom we can fully trust.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We always have to put our trust in the Lord Jer 17:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans three also indicates that no one is trustworthy and that only God is true and faithful v. 4 . Only God is faithful because all of us human beings are weak and selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may trust me very much, and your trusting in me always makes me happy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, you cannot make me happy all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Something will eventually happen that will make me unhappy with you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once this happens, that might become a factor in me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This little factor could grow and grow and eventually the unhappiness will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows us that we should not trust in man, but trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will avoid a lot of damaging issues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will not only protect you, but also protect the one in whom you trust.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though we have all been regenerated and a number among us have been greatly transformed, we are still human and still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have our weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would not want any of you to trust in me fully.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not that perfect, able, or capable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you trust in me fully and completely with no reservation, you will delay yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, you will destroy me, you will destroy yourself, and you will destroy the entire situation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to consider that I am merely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I might be a little more capable than you are, but I am not almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I may be a good brother, but I am not absolutely perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we all must exercise some kind of caution and some kind of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should love each other and we should trust in each other, yet we have to realize that we are all still human.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Overtrusting really damages.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not to trust is wrong, but to trust in full is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not trusting in full does not mean that you do not trust.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church life we should always have caution and consideration, but this does not give you the ground to be suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are always two sides to everything.</S>
