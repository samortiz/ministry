   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The turning away of man's heart from God results in serious tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To turn away from God and from His word, which is Christ, is to lose all the blessings and to suffer the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three points regarding God's loving heart and righteous governmental dealing, man's obedience and faithfulness, and the tragic result of man's turning his heart away from God make up the governing thought of reviewing the past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This thought, which is found throughout the Bible and which is evident in the New Testament, should govern us whenever we intend to have a review of our condition.</S>
