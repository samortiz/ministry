   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S DESIRE THAT WE LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear saints, be deeply impressed that Jesus Christ is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God does not want you to improve your behavior; He wants you to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He does not want you to begin loving your wife and no longer hate her; He wants you to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As you live Him, you will love others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever you are doing, God wants you to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 and "to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To me to live is not love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not humility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not frankness or kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is our life; He must become our living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to pray in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Lord, I want to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Keep me in Your Spirit so that I never forget that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I am about to lose my temper, remind me that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I am about to love someone, remind me that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I am about to act in a humble way, remind me that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I smile, remind me that You are my life."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This must be our prayer not just once but over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before we begin our day, we should tell the Lord, "Remind me during the whole day that You are my life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In dealing with my children, or in dealing with my parents, I want to take You as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I know You do not want me to try to improve my behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your desire is to have Yourself lived out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Keep this before me all day long whatever I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>O Lord, remind me that You are my life!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE MEANING OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was young, the word fellowship used to puzzle me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Chinese the word was usually translated fraternity, a kind of social brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Gradually, due to our influence in the Far East, the word fraternity has largely been dropped, and now the word used is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word for fellowship means mutual participation or communication.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the New Testament revelation, like in 2 Corinthians 13:14, it can be likened to the term transmission, which is used for electricity and means a sending back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the electric lights in the ceiling are turned on, the electricity flows into them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the lights are turned off, the current stops.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Though the electricity is still there, the transmission has ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The electric current is the transmission of electricity from the power plant into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It goes back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fellowship is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not merely friendly contact with others, as in a fraternity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is instead a powerful, dynamic transmission from one place to another and then back to the original place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have Christ in us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this life functions, it is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life corresponds to electricity; fellowship corresponds to electric current.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Electric current is simply electricity itself in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fellowship is nothing less than Christ Himself as life moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" 1 Cor 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This fellowship into which we have been called is simply Christ Himself moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While Christ remains in us, He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He moves in us, He is the fellowship.</S>
