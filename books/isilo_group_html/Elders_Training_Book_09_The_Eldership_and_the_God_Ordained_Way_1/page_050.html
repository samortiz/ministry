What is the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel? This was the saints in Philippi participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul's ministry. This was to help the apostle's preaching and to share with his preaching.</P><P>What is the relationship between the work and the churches? The relationship is this&#151;the churches should always help the work and cooperate with the work to promote God's work, and the work should try the best to always strengthen the churches, edify the churches, establish the churches, and build up the churches for the building up of the Body of Christ. Thus, the churches and the work should be very much in cooperation and coordination with each other. This is why we say that the churches should be one with the ministry. This means that the churches should cooperate with the work for the promotion of God's move on this earth. It is logical for a Christian worker to expect the result of his work to cooperate with the work for the promotion of God's move.</P><P>I brought the recovery to the United States, and you received it. You are the result of my work. Should I not expect that you all would be one with me, cooperating with me to promote the Lord's recovery? What is wrong with this? Some opposing ones have said that we should not say that we need to be one with the ministry, that is, the work. They think that this is to build up the ministry. They are wrong. To be one with the ministry is not to build up the ministry. To be one with the ministry is to help the ministry to go on to further the Lord's move on this earth. Eventually, the ministry does not build up anything for the ministry itself. What the ministry builds up is the churches. Today there are over one thousand churches around the globe. In Mexico, Central America, and South America, hundreds of churches have been raised up within the last few years through the ministry, mainly through the printed publications and the audio and video tapes.</P><P>In order for the ministry to go on, the ministry needs the churches' cooperation, support, and prayer. This is what it means to be one with the ministry. To be one with the ministry does not mean to build up the ministry. To be one with the ministry means to strengthen and to help the ministry build up more churches. When I speak to the churches in a conference, this does not mean that I am speaking to build up my ministry. I am speaking to build up the churches. The more the churches cooperate with the work, the better. Then the work will receive more strengthening, more help, and more encouragement to build up and to raise up more churches, and even to edify the churches more, to strengthen the churches more, and to build up the churches more. Then the churches will be greatly helped through the ministry.</P><P>By the Lord's mercy, I have passed on the Lord's recovery to you by speaking. I have been outside of mainland China now for thirty-nine years. Through my ministry in these past thirty-nine years, over one thousand churches have been raised up. The credit for this, without question, all goes to the Lord who spoke through me, but without the support and cooperation of the churches, how much could I do? I did not build up the churches directly. I just spoke the word of God. You brothers build up the churches directly. I was surprised when I came here to see how the brothers are so much for the Lord, with the Lord, and of the Lord. This has been your work. My part is to speak the word of God.</P><P>All of the churches today around the globe were raised up and built up by the Lord's speaking through Brother Nee and through me. The foundation was laid by the Lord's speaking through Brother Nee. Then the Lord used me to speak. But the direct building up of the churches is the work of you brothers. Moses did not build up the tabernacle directly. The tabernacle was built by the children of Israel. Suppose that the children of Israel did not cooperate with Moses. What could have come out? I came to this country to pass on the Lord's recovery to the saints, but if the saints had rejected this, nothing would have come out. But so much has come out through you brothers. A great part of the credit for the Lord's move should be given to you brothers and to the churches. We have to realize that the enemy hates this. We need to pray concerning anything negative that rises up against the proper, organic relationship between the churches and the work, the ministry.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
