   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At this point in our fellowship concerning knowing the Body, I would like to add a word concerning those saints whom the Lord used to recover the experiences of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Madame Guyon was the one who took the lead in this recovery in the seventeenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, although she was so spiritual and in life, she still went to the image of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The preface of her biography said something concerning her doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we translated this biography into Chinese over fifty years ago, a brother among us had the thought of including this preface, but we did not agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her life with the Lord was very good, but the truth was not that complete to her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We could not publish such a preface in the Chinese version of her biography.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am sharing this to impress us that we should not trust in people's spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Spirituality is conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How spiritual is it to be spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you say that someone is very good, how good is very good?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may be very spiritual today, but how will you be ten years later?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because spirituality is conditional, it should not be taken as a base or as a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The base and the standard must be the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The truth is not conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1957 Brother T. Austin-Sparks came to us in Taiwan for the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We had a few sessions with him to talk about the matter of spirituality and the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Dr. Chang Yu-lan, who is now with the Lord, pointed out that there were a number of meetings in Taipei all of which claimed to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then he asked Brother Austin-Sparks which one of these meetings could be considered as the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Austin-Sparks said strongly that the ones who have more of Christ are the ones who are more the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At first I thought I should not be involved in this discussion, since I was the translator.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, I realized that I had to say something; otherwise, the issue would not be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I pointed out that Christ is the element, the reality, and the center of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this, we might mistakenly think that those who have more of Christ are more the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although this seems to be correct, I showed that this was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I pointed out the example of Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She had much of Christ, but she still remained in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Could we say that because she had much of Christ, she was right concerning the church?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I pointed out how Brother Austin-Sparks referred to F.B. Meyer in his messages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although F.B. Meyer was very spiritual, he still remained in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He worked for and built up that denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Could we say that because Brother Meyer had much of Christ, he was right concerning the church?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My speaking refuted what Brother Austin-Sparks said.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My illustrations showed that we should not say that the more of Christ you have, the more you are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Austin-Sparks visited us in Taiwan in 1955 and in 1957.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He took many pictures during his first visit and he showed these slides to people when he returned to England.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He said that in his entire life, he never had such a marvelous congregation as he had in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He visited us again in 1957, and this is when the problem with him arose over the truth concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he returned he told people that I was too much for the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I told people, however, that I was not yet enough for the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church should be measured by the ground of locality and by the reality of the Spirit of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It should not be measured by people's spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spirituality is relative and conditional.</S>
