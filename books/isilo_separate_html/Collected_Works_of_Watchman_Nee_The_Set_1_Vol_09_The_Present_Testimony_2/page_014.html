This is because sin and death are just one law. The law of sin and of death are not two laws, but two aspects of one law. With respect to sin, this law has a habit to positively commit many sins. With respect to death, this law deprives one of the power to keep the demands of the law. This is on the negative side. Many people do not understand the meaning of "death." "Death" means to be weak to the uttermost, to be without any strength, and to be without life. Death is a law because weakness and powerlessness are our habitual experience. Romans 7 emphasizes these two things. Paul said, "I do not do the good which I will"-this refers to death, and "the evil which I do not will, this I practice"-this refers to sin (v. 19). All the problems we encounter daily within ourselves are the result of the law of sin and of death. Many times, we do not have the strength to do what we desire to do, and we do not have the strength to not do what we do not want to do.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we need to see how evil the law of sin and of death is! Not only should we hate sin, but we should hate the law of sin and of death. We are so helpless before this law. But praise and thank the Lord, He has a total salvation. God's salvation does not deal with our individual sins. God's salvation deals with the root, the law. Formerly, when we encountered the same temptations, we produced the same results. But we do not have to have the same results now. This is the difference between having the law of the Spirit and not having the law of the Spirit. Apart from this, there is no victory.</P><P>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Where are we freed from the law of sin and of death? We are freed in Christ Jesus. I have to say "Hallelujah! All is well in Christ Jesus." The Bible does not say that in Christ we will be condemned, nor does it say that in Christ we will sin. It says that in Christ there is no more condemnation, and in Him we are free.</P><P>What does it mean to be in Christ? To be in Christ means to be joined to Him. We cannot be joined to Christ by ourselves, but when Christ died, God joined us in His death. We have died in the death of Christ and have been resurrected in the resurrection of Christ. When we believed in Christ, we believed into Christ. John 3:16 says, "That every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life." To believe means to believe into. By faith we are joined into Christ. Romans 6:3 says, "All of us who have been baptized into Christ..." When we believe and are baptized, that baptism puts us into Christ. This is faith. Although you cannot understand how you have been joined to Christ, it does not matter, for when you were baptized through faith, God joined you to Christ. There is not one saved Christian who is not in Christ; every one of them is in Christ.</P><P>What have we received in Christ? Romans 8:1-2 reveals two things were done that are most precious, and for which we can thank and praise God! Christ dealt with our sins through His crucifixion, and Christ dealt with our death-our utter spiritual weakness-through His resurrection from the dead. In the same way that Christ overcame sin, we will overcome sin. In the same way that Christ overcame death, we will overcome death. We are freed in Christ, which means that we are liberated in Christ and are delivered from the law of sin and of death.</P><P>I do not know what kind of law you have inside that does particular things, but I know that within you there is a law of sin and of death. You have your own particular law of sin and of death, but I can tell you that the law of the Spirit of life has freed you in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. The law of the Spirit of life is the law of resurrection, which is the same law that caused the Lord to resurrect from the dead. The life that we received on the day we believed in the Lord is a resurrection life; it is also the regenerating life. When we believed in the Lord, we received not only a resurrection, we also received the law of the Spirit of life. This law frees and delivers us from the law of sin and of death. When we believed in the Lord, the Holy Spirit entered into our heart and dispensed to us the Lord's life which overcomes sin and death, so that we can overcome sin and death through the Spirit of life. Brothers and sisters, perhaps you do not understand this, but that is all right. All that you have to do is to lay hold of God's Word. You can say to God, "Your Word says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Does the Bible say that we are about to be freed? No. Does it say that we will be freed? No! The Bible says, "Freed!" I was like one who was imprisoned, and the law of sin and of death chained me with a chain that was even stronger than a jailer's chains. The law of sin and of death surrounded me, more than a prison cell surrounds a prisoner. But now, the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ. I am like one who has been released from prison. When a man receives the order that he will be released from prison, does he come out joyfully or does he come out wailing and weeping? The minute he is released, the very same minute, he comes out joyfully. It is the law of the Spirit of life that has freed me and has delivered me from the law of sin and of death. The freeing is the work of the Spirit, while deliverance is the result we have received.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, would you hold onto God's Word by faith? Do you know how much this life includes? God not only saves you from sin and death, but He also saves you from the law of sin and of death. Are you ensnared by filthy thoughts, jealousies, and tempers? Would you believe that "the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death"? Let me ask, "Are you in Christ?" If you are in Christ, you are freed and delivered from the law of sin and of death. Would you believe that the sin that ensnared you, ensnared you even yesterday, has been unshackled in Christ? Even if you are the greatest sinner among one million people, would you believe that as soon as you lay hold of the Word, "the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death," that there is nothing that you cannot do? If I merely exhort you to be good today, what difference is there from the men of the world who exhort you to be moral and ethical? What difference is there from exhorting you to keep God's law? We thank God that the Bible tells us what God has done for us in Christ. As long as we believe, everything will be all right. There is not another way to victory in the whole world. You can buffet your body and deny yourselves. You may be able to overcome sin and death in this way. But you will not be able to overcome the law of sin and of death. Brothers and sisters, we can lift up our heads to thank the Lord, saying, "The law which causes me to constantly sin has been dealt with by You." There is no other way. All we have to do is to believe that, at the time we were saved, God freed us from the filthy and weak law through the Spirit in Christ. Once we believe, we overcome. As soon as we believe, the Holy Spirit will immediately work, and the law that has been enslaving us will not be able to control us any longer. I know that I have sinned, and I know the seriousness of the law of sin and of death. But I believe that in Christ the law of sin and of death will not have power over me.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
