<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CARRYING OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>BY A REVIVED LIFE</H1><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship more concerning how to carry out the God-ordained way. First, I want to point out some crucial items of revelation which were released in the summer training of 1987.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY TO PRACTICE<br>THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</H2><P>In the summer training of 1987, I shared nineteen messages which are contained in the book entitled The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy. A number of these messages are crucial in revelation. The first chapter of this book is concerning the divine economy. In that chapter there is one point which I never released in the previous years of my ministry. That point is concerning the completion of Christ. The record of the completion of Christ is in the four Gospels. Then in the Acts, this completed Christ was propagated. God's Christ is eternally perfect, but such an eternally perfect Christ needed to be completed. Today our Savior is the completed Christ. He has been completed in incarnation, in human living, in crucifixion, in resurrection, in becoming the essential Spirit of life, in ascension, and in becoming the economical Spirit of power.</P><P>I also consider the last three chapters of this book to be very critical. These three chapters are entitled "The Apostles' Teaching and Fellowship," "The New Testament Ministry and Ministers," and "The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry and among the New Testament Ministers." According to the New Testament record, the leadership is in the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42). In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things from God's economy. First Timothy shows us that there was some leadership that charged people to teach the proper thing. This shows that the proper leadership is in the apostles' teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APPLICATION OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>BY A REVIVED LIFE</H2><P>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning the application of the God-ordained way, the biblical way, the new way. To know this way outwardly is not that difficult, but to apply the biblical way to meet and to serve is not so simple. This biblical way includes four things: (1) the preaching of the gospel by visiting people to get people saved for Christ (Matt. 28:19; Mark 16:15); (2) having home meetings set up in the new ones' homes for nourishing and cherishing them that they may grow in life (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2); (3) having group meetings to group the new ones together for perfecting (Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12-13); and (4) prophesying, speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord, in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23-24, 31, 39a). None of these four items is easy. Even the first step of visiting people to get them saved is not easy.</P><P>To visit people for the preaching of the gospel, we must be revived persons. We must be stirred up in our spirit. We must be praying persons who pray ourselves into our spirit. Then when we are in the light, we can make a thorough confession of all our sinfulness, defects, and failures. For the entire day we have to walk in the spirit and we have to live Christ. We also must learn to speak Christ all day long to anybody. Then this will qualify us to be the right persons to go out, not merely with a doctrinal gospel but with the living person of Christ.</P>
