   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Every District Meeting Needing to Have</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rich Content in Order to Supply the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The district meetings are generally fresh and living and are different from the past; more saints are speaking in the meetings, and the atmosphere is more open.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, as a whole, the speaking is not rich enough, so the content of the meetings is rather poor; this is a shortcoming that requires our further study.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From now on we will spend more time focusing on the ninety-six districts in Taipei; we will study these districts one by one and present the condition of each district to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may be likened to our appearing before the Lord s judgment seat in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time the Lord will ask us what we have done since the day of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 14:10 says, We will all stand before the judgment seat of God, and verse 12 says, Each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, in Matthew 12:36, the Lord spoke even more severely, saying, Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God records all the words that we speak in our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today man invents equipment such as audio machines and computers to record sound and information, but God does not need to invent anything; He has already recorded what we have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what the Bible reveals to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope that the saints will make progress in the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we all speak in the meetings, we still need to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we lack is rich content in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This can be compared to a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes though every player is capable, because of the weather conditions, everyone feels spiritless on the field, and in the end they lose the game.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have at most fifty people in each district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If all fifty would speak, the meetings would be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, one of the responsible brothers may not be happy when he gets up in the morning, another brother may be upset, and many others may have their own situations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the end, although everyone speaks, every person s speaking was poor, and the entire meeting was flavorless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At such times, if one of the brothers is watchful, he will be able to turn the condition of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a basketball game, when there are only fifteen seconds left and the result has not yet been determined, the coach will ask for a time out to instruct the players, presenting them with a strategy so that they can score in the last fifteen seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes, because of the speaking during the time out, the team gains the final victory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the same with the condition of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Someone must be on the alert and speak something in spirit so that we all can learn and be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we older ones first began to serve in the church, we led in this way; that is, we exercised to be alert.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fifty years ago we learned to direct the rudder in the meeting; though the directing may have not been visible outwardly, we were absolutely in control of the rudder in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, when a prayer in the meeting was off the mark, we would inwardly ask the Lord to bring the prayer back to the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When some saints were not functioning properly, we would ask the Lord to find someone to uplift the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord always answers this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today in the process of changing the system, we must be on the alert while directing the rudder of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we see that the condition of the meeting is not proper and that there are only three or five minutes remaining, we should stand up and speak a word to supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This depends on our labor in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we speak well, we will be able to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our meetings must be like a feast to which we all gather.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the table there is food, not empty bowls and plates; however, the food may be tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, if in the last few minutes someone would open his mouth to speak the Lord s word, everyone will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord has revealed this way to us, and if we take it, every group meeting and district meeting will be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This requires that we all labor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must labor over the Lord s word, grasping every opportunity to redeem the time and get into the riches in the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we have prepared a ten-minute prophecy, we can practice by speaking it to people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not have a person to speak to, we can speak to the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to practice unceasingly so that we can quickly learn to speak the Lord s word in the meetings with a rich content.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sisters should not think that because they are sisters, they do not have a responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the sisters cannot be elders, they should be prophets who prophesy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There were many prophetesses in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For instance, the first one who took the lead to praise God after the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea was Miriam, a prophetess Exo 15:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are also prophetesses in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Acts, Philip the evangelist had four daughters who prophesied 21:9 ; this, I believe, was due to Philip s family being a learned family.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we see that the habit of prophesying must be promoted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether we are a brother or a sister, we should prepare ourselves to prophesy in the district meetings on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not wait until the Lord s Day; instead, we should prepare our prophecy by Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then when we come to the meeting, we should speak it before the brothers and sisters to supply them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Preparing to prophesy in this way is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some may wonder if this kind of preparation involves too much human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if we consider Mary as an example, we will realize her familiarity with the Old Testament required human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not every Jewish woman could have prophesied as she did; she truly was a blessed woman.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should also see that Mary did not prophesy as people had prophesied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Old Testament when the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon someone, he was able to give a word of prophecy Num 24:2-9; 1 Sam 10:6; 19:20; 2 Chron 15:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the outset, however, Mary s prophesying was in the principle of the New Testament, which involves the cooperation of God and man, man working in coordination with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God needed a woman like Mary who spent much effort to study the Scriptures, was well versed in God s word, loved the Lord inwardly, and had fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only such ones are suitable candidates, and only such human effort coordinates with God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is what we are shown in the beginning of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul exhorts the brothers and sisters to desire earnestly to prophesy; he exhorts them to desire not only the Lord but to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the trainees should practice much in this matter; like the pious Mary, they need to consecrate themselves to love the Lord, study the Lord s word, and not waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we waste time doing other things, we will not be right with ourself, and even more we will not be right with our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our parents have the expectation that we will not waste our time, and we should not let them down; therefore, we must also firmly grasp the time and diligently exercise in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We not only need to be familiar with the Bible, but we also need to thoroughly know the outlines and footnotes of every book.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the majority of us have this kind of spirit, what is within us will be manifested outwardly when we come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We will be able to put forth what we have when the opportunity comes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is to have our human work cooperate with God s work to speak forth God s word and speak it into people so that they may be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How rich such a meeting will be!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the past, under the influence of the tradition of Christianity, our meetings became somewhat deformed and were the same as the so-called Sunday worship services.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although we used the term meeting and everyone came with their Bibles, no one was concerned about what they should do because the responsible brothers made all the arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It was not the saints responsibility to call hymns and pray, much less to speak; their responsibility was simply to sit and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After over thirty years of listening, we became numb, and a tradition of not speaking became established among us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the reason that it is so difficult to promote prophesying today.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, we should all enter into and promote prophesying, speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the past, we did not have the opportunity to do this, but now we have been given the opportunity in the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whether we are brothers or sisters, we can join a district meeting, and when the opportunity comes, we can open our mouth to speak for the Lord and speak Him into others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After serving the Lord for more than sixty years, I have seen that the saints, whether in the East or in the West, have been greatly influenced by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We know that the Lord s salvation enlivens man, but the practice in Christianity deadens man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even if people are saved and enlivened through the gospel preaching of some great evangelists, they seem to become frozen once they are sent to the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although many have seen this outcome, no one has called out loudly to overturn the degraded tradition and let the saints rise up to function.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do not think that my speaking is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The burden within me is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What causes my heart to ache the most is that some people have doubts concerning the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I must tell them to wait and see; the new way will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We can be sure of this because we know that the new way is according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Matthew 5:18 says that until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or one serif will pass away from the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>First Corinthians 14:26 says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Though this word is very familiar to us, it has not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Can this word be in the Bible but not be fulfilled by the time the Lord returns?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Moreover, Hebrews 10:25 says, Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Do we have any meeting in which we exhort one another?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We can say that in all of Christianity there is nothing like this; nevertheless, I have a deep conviction that these two verses in the Bible will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Even if I do not see the fulfillment and accomplishment of this word of the Lord in my lifetime, those who continue the recovery will surely see the success of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord will definitely fulfill this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we are wise, we should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude; rather, we should all endeavor and strive together.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even if we cannot see the success in our generation, the next generation will see it and be grateful that we who preceded them endeavored in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>History tells us that the reforms carried out by Martin Luther did not originate with him but were begun by a few pioneers who had brought in some reforms before him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The battle we are fighting is supported by the truth; no one can deny that.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even those with a wait-and-see attitude acknowledge that we are speaking according to the Bible; nevertheless, there is a big but they are unable to keep pace with us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I hope that all the elders and co-workers among us will say Amen instead of but.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Let us all push this old car together.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Even if the mountain road is difficult, we will be able to push the car uphill if several hundred are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is our spirit; we all should have such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I am not being proud when I say that in the early days, I was the first one to take this way in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When we first took this way, we had such a spirit, and no one was able to shake us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Some in Chefoo said that they did not need to pay attention to us because we were merely a group of youngsters leading other youngsters and that we would come to an end. However, this was not the case; the situation of the whole church changed completely within as little as one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>After I came to Taiwan, some people told me that the church ground of which I spoke would never work.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Later, when I came to America, some people also tried to persuade me that if I spoke about the church ground, no one would accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Nevertheless, I was clear inwardly that they needed to wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Although some may not accept it, they do not represent the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is true that some may not want to take this way, but there are many more who desire to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What matters is whether or not we are speaking the truth according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If some could prove that my speaking was not according to the truth or the revelation in the Bible, I would immediately kneel down to pray, confess my sins, and ask the Lord for His forgiveness and the saints for their forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>However, if my speaking is according to the Bible, none should put a question mark on it.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In particular, those brothers who are my fellow workers should not have this kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>To do so is to be wrong and unfaithful.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If some are my co-workers, they should be in one accord with me; otherwise, they are not my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>From now on, all the responsible ones in the district meetings need to direct the rudder and supply the meetings; otherwise, they cannot be considered responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>To be a responsible one in the district meetings means to be one who prepares a dish in case everyone else fails to bring their dishes to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It also means being one who can put out some dessert even if everyone else has brought something.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The responsible ones need not be in a hurry to prophesy; they can save their prophecy for the end and give priority to others.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In this way, the district meetings will not be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>A long message cannot supply people; everyone functioning is what supplies people.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>A lengthy message may not supply people, but if in the last ten minutes of the district meeting a responsible one rises up to speak a finishing prophecy, it will be most edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The food we offer to people when they are hungry is the most delicious.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>They may be listening for forty-five minutes without receiving anything, but when a responsible one stands up to speak eight minutes, he can give them a sense of freshness and of being full of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I truly believe and have the assurance that this can be attained to.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Through this kind of fellowship, I hope that we are all clear and understand the direction we should take from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We are serving the churches; if we receive this burden, the meetings in all the churches will not be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Furthermore, I hope that we can study and come together for fellowship concerning the increase or decrease in number within the ninety-six districts in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>In this way, we can receive the light for the future progress of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We are still in the process of investigation and improvement, and we want to receive help and revelation from these words of fellowship so that the churches may reap a great benefit.</S>
