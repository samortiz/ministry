They do not have the Lord's gospel of redemption for the sinners. Their understanding of Christ's redemption is altogether based on their way of interpreting Old Testament prophecies. This interpretation is peculiar and childish. Their basic principle of prophetic interpretation is to regard a day in the Bible as a year.</p><p>First, they base their argument on God's word to the Israelites in Numbers 14:34: "According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day a year, you shall bear your iniquities, forty years, and you shall know My displeasure." The Israelites spent forty days to spy out the land. Because of their unbelief, Jehovah punished them by allowing them to wander in the wilderness for forty years so that they would know His displeasure. God's punishment of the Israelites with forty years of wandering is unrelated to prophecy. One cannot take this word and say that in every instance a day should be interpreted as a year. There is no prophetic significance in this passage. It is not a prophecy. God merely stated that He would punish the Israelites for forty years. Yet this forms the basis of these ones' interpretation of the prophecies. Can this be a principle in prophetic interpretation? We will prove the error of such an assumption from the Bible.</p><p>Second, the Judaizers promote this teaching by using Ezekiel 4:4-6. Jehovah told Ezekiel to lie upon his left side for three hundred and ninety days on behalf of the iniquities of the house of Israel and to lie upon his right side for forty days on behalf of the iniquities of the house of Judah. Each day would account for a year of their iniquities. Here again the issue is punishment. It was one day for a year. If it was one year for a day of iniquities, Ezekiel would have needed to lie on his bed all his life. Here God told Ezekiel only to lie for a day for every year of the Israelites' iniquities. Other than these two instances, there is no other place in the Old Testament that takes a day as a year. Both these cases refer to punishment, not to prophecy. Suppose a mother wants to spank her child three times. Is that a prophecy or is that a punishment? Clearly that is a punishment, not a prophecy; it has nothing to do with prophecy. The stories spoken of in these two passages are clearly related to God's punishment of the Israelites. They are the only two cases where such a parallel is drawn, and they are isolated cases. This application is not general and does not apply to every instance. It is very dangerous to take these two things and apply them as principles to prophetic interpretation.</p><h2 class="head2">Refutation of the Judaizers' Erroneous Interpretation of Prophecies</h2><p>Many verses in the Bible refer to a day as a day and to a year as a year. No one can say that these passages are wrong. In the Bible a day is a day, not a year. We can prove this with many verses. In Genesis 7:4 God said, "For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights." If we take the Judaizers' word, a day would be a year, and this would mean that God would have to wait for seven years before He would send the rain. But verse 10 says that after seven days the flood came and deluged the earth. Verse 12 says that for forty days and nights the rain fell. The forty days and nights were actual days and nights; they were not forty years.</p><p>In Genesis 40:12 Joseph interpreted the dream to the butler, saying, "The three branches are three days." Verse 13 says, "Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place." Verse 20 says, "And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants." The butler indeed resumed his service. Here three days means three days, not three years.</p><p>In Joshua 1:11 Joshua commanded the officers of the people to say to the congregation, "Prepare provisions for yourselves, for in three days you are crossing this Jordan to enter and possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess." Joshua 3:2 says, "And at the end of three days..." In verse 16 the people followed the ark and crossed the Jordan. Here again three days meant three days, not three years.</p><p>In the New Testament, Matthew 12:40 says, "For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights." Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, not three years. We know that the Lord rose up from the dead after three days, not three years.</p><p>In Revelation 2:10 the Lord told the church in Smyrna: "You will have tribulation for ten days." Ten days is ten days, not ten years.</p><p>Revelation 20:2 and 4 say that Satan will be bound for a thousand years and that God's overcomers and the martyrs will reign for a thousand years. If a day equals a year, this would mean 365,000 years. This is wrong; it is entirely without any scriptural basis.</p><p>From the above verses, we see that a day is a day and a year is a year. There is no prophecy which says that a day should be treated as a year. Only curious minds invented such principles as a day for a year. The two passages that the Judaizers quote are not related to prophecy. They base their understanding of redemption on their interpretation of prophecy according to the day-year postulate. This is wrong.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_092.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_094.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 93</div><br></body></html>
