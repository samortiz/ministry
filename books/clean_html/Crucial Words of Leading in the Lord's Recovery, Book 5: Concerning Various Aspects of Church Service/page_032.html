<h2 class="head2">Current Elders and New Elders<br />
Having Their Function</h2>
<p>Since we are taking the way of separating the halls and yet administrating together, there is the need to pay attention to the separate aspect and to the together aspect. The coming together of the elders takes care of the together aspect. There are many affairs that need to be taken care of, such as purchasing land and building a meeting hall for the spread. These matters are not related to the separate aspect; they are matters for the whole church. The six current elders, who are older, should bear the responsibility of matters concerning the whole church, whereas the newly appointed elders, who are between thirty and fifty years of age, should concentrate on mobilizing the twenty-one meeting halls. Therefore, we feel that it is best for the new elders to be under fifty years old. They are still full of energy and have some experience. This will enable them to promote the work in the meeting halls.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Full-time Co-workers<br />
Concentrating on Spiritual Work</h2>
<p>Furthermore, there are ten full-time co-workers in Taipei. Most of them have become stewards in a district, taking care of local administrative work. Few of them concentrate on promoting the spiritual side of the Lord&rsquo;s work. The spiritual side of the work includes preaching the gospel, speaking for God, and teaching the truth. When the co-workers are sent out, they are the apostles. Ephesians 4:11 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; When the evangelists, teachers, and prophets are sent out, they become apostles. Paul and Barnabas were prophets and teachers in Antioch; they were not apostles. However, according to the record in Acts, when they were sent out, they were called apostles. Today the full-time brothers among us rarely preach the gospel or serve as teachers, nor do they go out as apostles. Most of them are entangled in the administration and service of the local church. This practice is not according to the truth of the Bible or the principle of the Body.</p>
<p>According to the truth, the administration and affairs of a locality should be borne entirely by the local brothers. The full-time brothers have put aside their jobs and consecrated their future to the Lord, not for local administration or local affairs but for the preaching of the gospel, the spread of God&rsquo;s word, and the producing and establishing of the churches in every place. However, instead of doing these things, our co-workers have been busy with the affairs of the church in Taipei and have thus replaced the local brothers. There are many brothers and sisters in Taipei who have a heart for the Lord and are useful, but they have not been put to use. This situation is inappropriate. Our principle is that all the full-time co-workers should be set apart from the local administration and local affairs of a church so that they can concentrate on the spiritual side of the work.</p>
<p>We want to keep these two principles: new elders in the meeting halls should not be over sixty years old, and the co-workers should concentrate on the spiritual side of the work. According to these two principles, none of the newly appointed elders in the twenty-one meeting halls should be over sixty years of age, and the full-time co-workers should not be elders. However, after careful consideration and arrangement, several meeting halls still need a few brothers who are over sixty and a couple of co-workers to remain and labor for a period of time, because we have not found suitable replacements. We hope to find replacements in a few months to correct this situation.</p>
<p>With regard to the length of an elder&rsquo;s term, we need to remember that the appointment of elders is entirely according to the Bible. After many years of practice and study, we can say that even though appointing the elders is in the Bible, there is not a clear statement concerning how long an elder should serve. Our practice in the past has been that once an elder was appointed, the appointment was for life. We did not know how to deal with elders who were not suitable when it became apparent over time. It is a good sign when brothers are willing to serve the Lord for life, but it is not good for such a situation to be without limitation.</p>
<p>Suppose an elder is old, physically weak, and his memory is lagging, but he insists on remaining an elder. Because of him, the elders&rsquo; meeting cannot make any decisions without repeated fellowship. This situation causes everyone to feel helpless. Since we absolutely abide by the Bible, and the Bible says nothing concerning this, no one dares to do anything. We have indeed suffered from such situations over the past fifty years. After such brothers serve as elders for several years, it becomes apparent that they are not suitable to be elders, but it is difficult to ask them to step aside, because we fear that they might get hurt. These are some problems that we have experienced, and we hope that we all understand these situations.</p>
