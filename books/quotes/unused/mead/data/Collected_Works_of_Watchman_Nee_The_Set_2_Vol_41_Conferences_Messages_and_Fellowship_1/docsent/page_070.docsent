   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Clear of One's Own Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 12:28-30 speaks of nine kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first three are apostles, prophets, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three are the primary gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then six secondary gifts are listed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first three gifts are included in Ephesians 4; they are special gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The remaining six gifts are miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Throughout church history, many of the miraculous gifts have occasionally ceased in their operation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the five gifts in Ephesians 4 have never ceased in their operation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through these five gifts, the church has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These five gifts are particular gifts, whereas the rest are ordinary gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we must ask: Who has these five gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have to settle this question before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are one of these gifts, we have to ask: What is my personal ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to ask because our ministry is intimately related to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are not clear about our ministry, we will kick others' feet as we go along, and we will step on others' toes as we turn around.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ministry which God has assigned to every one of His workers has its own sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only work within the sphere that the Lord has assigned for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever the sphere of our ministry may be, we have to work within that sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, there are times when there are exceptions, when we can work beyond our own sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Each person's ministry is related to the ministries of others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some relationships require that we take the lead, while other relationships require that we submit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once we are clear about our own sphere, we should work within our own sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, we will come into conflict with others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who do not have a ministry should be careful and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They should wait on God and not act rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Disputes among co-workers are usually disputes concerning the ministries, rather than disputes concerning the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose a man is a concrete worker yet insists on doing the work of a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may covet another person's portion, but he still cannot do what others can do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All ministries are assigned by the Lord, and all gifts are distributed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There should be a harmonious coordination between the workers and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, the workers should not give the churches a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, the churches should not frustrate the workers' work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The goal of the churches should be the increase of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the responsible brothers in the local churches should not hinder the work of the ministry or the work of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Directing the Ministries</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible separates the workers from the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The work of the workers is upon the apostles' shoulders, whereas the responsibilities of the churches are on the elders' shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The apostles are for all the churches, while the elders are for one church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter was an apostle as well as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was an apostle to the churches, but at the same time, he was an elder in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, he served in the local church as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, he worked among the churches as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both the local ministries and the workers' ministries are ministries, which in the original language is diaconia, translated also as deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a meeting is first raised up, there may not be suitable brothers who can act as responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some among them may have to temporarily pick up various responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At a certain point when the number becomes bigger, men who are more suitable than the temporary ones may become manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The temporary ones should then step aside and yield their work to the brothers with more manifested gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A responsible brother of a church should not only be gifted, but should also have a good name, be filled with the Spirit, and be full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament shows us that different people have different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apollos had a ministry, and Silas had a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Apollos, Silas, Timothy, Epaphroditus, Titus, Mark, and Luke all had their own ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul could direct some of them, but he could not direct others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the matter of directing others, the directing one and the directed ones must mutually agree to such a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot act as the denominations, in which the power of the organization is above the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whatever the organization directs the ministers to do, they have to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this is not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God wants to see mutual submission among the gifted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>True authority comes from a profound work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who are directing others must also be persons who can be directed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul was no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He sent for Timothy and Titus, but he also submitted to the brothers' sending.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a believer has a problem submitting to others, we must first ask if his fellowship with God has broken down.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It matters little if we agree on certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we submit, we have to submit from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God desires to see us submitting to one another.</S>
