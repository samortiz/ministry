   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WORKING TO SUPPORT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIMSELF AND TO HELP HIS CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 20:33 and 34 Paul went on to say, I have coveted no one s silver or gold or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs and to those who are with me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul worked with his hands at making tents 18:3 in order to support both himself and those who were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He worked in order to help his young co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that Paul s way was not that of today s clergy who make a profession out of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Like Paul, we all should bear the New Testament economy wherever we may be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the situation allows, we may spend our full time in the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, we should do something to support ourselves and also to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 20:35 Paul said, I have showed you all things, that toiling in this way we ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus which He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek words rendered the weak may also be translated the infirm, referring to those who are weak physically 1 Cor 11:30 ; hence, the poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 35 Paul asked the elders to remember the word of the Lord Jesus: It is more blessed to give than to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word is not recorded in the Gospels; it must have been received by oral communication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we carefully read Paul s word to the elders of the church in Ephesus, we shall see that Paul did not consider preaching a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, Paul had a genuine burden to carry out God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BURDENED FOR THE CARRYING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The situation on earth today needs a strong testimony, and a strong testimony requires much labor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus there is the great need for many to serve the Lord with their full time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in order to labor for the Lord, you need to be fully constituted of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would like to point out once again that the Lord s recovery is not an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, the recovery is the Lord s up-to-date move for the carrying out of His New Testament economy, which has not been fully carried out in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As those who have heard His word concerning His New Testament economy, we should say to Him, Lord, we are here for Your move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not want to merely gain the knowledge of Bible teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are willing to take up the burden to be constituted of all the New Testament teachings so that, like Paul, we may be vessels to carry out Your economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are even willing to labor full time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the situation requires that we work at a job to support ourselves and others, we should do so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, we should be willing to devote all our time to the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning God s New Testament economy, the need on earth today is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The need is much greater now than in the past centuries when missionaries went forth to preach the gospel and teach the Bible, to a large extent in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A superficial preaching of the gospel and teaching of the Bible will never carry out God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such preaching and teaching cannot afford God a way to carry out His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the Lord has enlightened us concerning His economy and has even burdened us and commissioned us to carry it out we all need to consider this seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not say to ourselves, I have been visiting different denominations and groups, but none of them can satisfy me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now I feel that the churches in the Lord s recovery are quite good, and I am satisfied simply to enjoy the church life here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This attitude is altogether not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the saints in the recovery need to be built up in the burden of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When some saints hear about the need to be burdened for the carrying out of God s New Testament economy, they may feel that they are not talented or gifted and therefore cannot do very much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if the saints are serious with the Lord and become saturated with the riches of God s economy, especially as conveyed in the Life-study Messages, they will be able to care for a number of others among their relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At least, we all are able to take care of ten other people, not preaching a shallow, superficial gospel or presenting a common teaching, but ministering the deeper truths of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are saturated with God s economy, whenever we speak concerning it, the truth will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, the people will be able to understand what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If all the saints in the Lord s recovery take care of ministering the truths of God s New Testament economy to ten others, there will be an excellent outcome for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others will be constituted of the truth through us, and they in turn will pass this truth on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will result in a marvelous multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to realize that in every nation people are seeking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They may be evil and worldly, but they still desire the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They want to know the real meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we all need to take up the burden to spread the truth concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In carrying out this burden, we should not follow the trend of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we should follow the pattern of the apostle Paul presented in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the sake of the Lord s propagation, let us all become saturated with God s economy and then help others to be saturated with it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I encourage the young people to set aside two years after graduating from college to be full time for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I suggest that these full time young people spend half a day to make a thorough study of the New Testament with the help of the Recovery Version, the footnotes, and the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, whether or not they continue to serve full time after the two years, they will be fully saturated with and established in the truth of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition to their study in the morning, these full time ones may use the remainder of the time to preach the gospel and contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I encourage the young people to consider this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We in the Lord s recovery are not here to be common members of a church doing an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Like Paul, our work should revolutionize the situation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul is an excellent pattern for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He not only carried out the burden of God s New Testament economy; he also labored with his hands making tents in order to support himself and help others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we also are faithful to work for the Lord s purpose, He will take care of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we shall be able to support many full-time workers not only in this country but in many others countries.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, if ten saints are faithful in rendering financial support to one full-time worker, out of a thousand saints one hundred will be able to go full time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is especially true in the United States where, according to the Lord s sovereignty, the economy is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who are burdened to go forth to labor full time in carrying out God s New Testament economy should not go out empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, they must go out with the full knowledge of the truth, at least the full knowledge of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We thank the Lord for opening up the New Testament to us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I believe that in the years to come the saints will see more riches in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May all the saints in the Lord s recovery be saturated with the riches of God s economy and then dig deeper into the Word to find more riches.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we go forth bearing the burden of God s economy, we should not care about the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Often those who are building a highway encounter opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nevertheless, they proceed to clear away the obstacles and fill in the gaps so that a highway can be built.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Let us go forth with such a spirit to carry out God s New Testament economy, presenting the teachings concerning God s economy to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many, when they hear of this, will be convinced and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Others may oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, instead of arguing, simply present the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although they may reject the truth again and again, eventually the Lord will gain them through our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let us all be filled with the riches of God s New Testament economy and then carry out the burden for God s economy positively and aggressively.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all can become aggressive if we are filled and saturated.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I hope that in the coming years there will be a great increase for the Lord s propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May there be a real stirring up throughout the earth!</S>
