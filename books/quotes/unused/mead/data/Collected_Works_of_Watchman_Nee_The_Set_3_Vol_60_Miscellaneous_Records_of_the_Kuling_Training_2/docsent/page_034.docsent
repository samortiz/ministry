   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 7 Date: August 30, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling THINGS THAT AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD DO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How much truth should an awakened sinner understand, and what should he do in order to receive salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will consider these two questions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE AMOUNT OF TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AN AWAKENED SINNER SHOULD KNOW The Gift of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing we should do after a sinner is awakened is to show him the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 4:10 says, "If you knew the gift of God...you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the gift of God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 14 tells us that the living water satisfies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person is touched by our preaching, we can bring him to salvation by just giving him a little push to take a further step.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we drag on with our preaching, however, we may not be able to push him to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is something that offends the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, some people are afraid of the coming judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should immediately tell them how they can escape it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we show them Matthew 11:28 instead, telling them that all those who are burdened can come to Him for rest, we are doing a foolish thing even though we are relating Scriptures to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a man is awakened to the vanity of the world, it is foolish to ramble on about the coming judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another sinner may feel the bondage and power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we ignore this and talk to him about the vanity of the world, we are being equally foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An evangelist should know a sinner's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever the sinner is thinking, we should meet his needs right away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not lead him around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In preaching the gospel, we do not dictate the kind of problems a sinner should have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we have to observe the problem that he actually has and then try to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is most offensive to the Lord for a gospel preacher to subjectively decide others' needs and problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A subjective man cannot save anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In preaching the gospel, we have to learn to be objective.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to learn to touch man's inner feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we can classify sinners into categories, every case is different in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to dispense God's gift to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man needs His gift.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never force down others' throats what they do not need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to give to them what they are awakened to and what they really need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must also note that man's natural thoughts are very legal and judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He thinks that God cannot give anything for free, that man must do something and behave in certain ways before he can please God and earn His gift.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man thinks that he must pay something in order to have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's salvation, however, is free; it is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord can meet the specific needs of each person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His gift can satisfy man's every need.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a man knows the gift of God, we have to give him a word from God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man may believe in a word that we have spoken to him, but he cannot remain in this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether we are speaking from the podium or in private, we have to point out God's Word to our listener.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to give him a clear verse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to give him too many verses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All that is needed is to open the necessary verse to him and to let him read it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to explain it clearly to him, and we have to tell him that this is the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let him read it over and over again, and let him feel that this is the word that will meet his need.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not enough for a sinner just to know God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to bring him to God and let him know that God is his Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can show him Matthew 7:11: "How much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, none of us believe in the teaching of the universal fatherhood of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we can still tell the sinner that God is a Father to the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As far as we are concerned, we are not His children until He begets us, but as far as God's love is concerned, God treats all human beings like His own children, whether or not they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God gave His only begotten Son to all sinners based on His fatherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a problem for God to be man's Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The problem is on the part of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will speak about this problem later.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are willing to ask of Him, He will grant us His gift.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In preaching the gospel to sinners, we can tell them that God loves the world like His own children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only thing He does not have with them is a life-relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can apply this analogy, because the Lord Jesus once did it as well Luke 15:11-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By giving the sinner a word from God, we bring him to a direct touch with God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a hard thing to ask a sinner to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As gospel preachers, we should always lead a sinner to God; we should always lead him to pray to the Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can read Matthew 7:11 to a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After a sinner understands our preaching, we should consummate the work by bringing him to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should point out Matthew 7:11 to the sinner and tell him that no father would hold back good things from his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is like our earthly father; He is willing to give us good things freely.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we have to ask him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praying a short prayer for five minutes is more effective than listening to a long sermon for five hours.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In preaching the gospel, we have to show the sinners through God's word that He is a God who dispenses gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is eager to dispense His grace to man.</S>
