For some time many have been influenced by the concept that the church life depends mainly on the young people
Of being useless those who are thirty and over are the ones most useful in caring for the tabernacle for the church as the Lords testimony
Today we must, on the one hand, maintain a strong and living testimony; on the other hand, we need to fight the battle
For the fighting of the battle, we need those under the age of thirty, but for maintaining the testimony, we need those thirty and over
Leviticus 2728 mentions various age groups those from twenty to sixty from five to twenty from one month to five years and those over sixty
As we shall see, according to God's scale the most important age for His testimony is the age between thirty and fifty
The Hebrew word which Darby renders 'service' in Numbers 4:3 has the meaning of military service and thus refers to warfare
They were fighting for God's testimony on earth, for among them was the tabernacle of the testimony, God's dwelling place on earth
Only those between the ages of thirty and fifty had the privilege of doing the work in and around the tabernacle
Those between twenty and thirty, however, were qualified for the military service, that is, for fighting the enemy
When the children of Israel were traveling, those in this group also carried the various parts of the tabernacle and its utensils
The middle-aged brothers and sisters must be those who set up the testimony, maintain it, and carry it from place to place
After a Levite had completed his five-year apprenticeship, he was qualified, at the age of thirty, to serve in the tabernacle
You may think that such young ones are useless for God's testimony, but God's economy is different from our natural concept
We need more young ones from one month to twenty years of age and we need enough older ones to take care of them
Although this illustration is not adequate, it may help us to see that in the church life we should not expect to be an elder or a leader
In November 1975, all the elders and deacons in Taipei resigned, many of whom had held certain positions for more than twenty-five years
Many who frequently give testimonies in the meeting function according to their eloquence, not according to the riches of Christ
When some reach the age of twenty-five, they should be willing to return to the tabernacle to learn how to care for the Lord's testimony
After the summer conference in 1964, many brothers in Los Angeles were eager to move to other localities for the practice of the church life
If the service functions when there is organization but stops otherwise, this is an indicator that the church is not normal
The right way is to care for a certain worldly one, ministering life to him, until a transformation has taken place in him
Some elders and co-workers still have the concept and attitude that they cannot do anything with those who do not seem to be promising
Neither the fighting on the frontier nor the taking care of the young ones is the direct service of the testimony, the direct church life
Those fighting on the frontier keep the enemy away, and the little ones, forming a wall around the tabernacle, maintain the testimony
A great many people are needed for the Lord's testimony, all of whom are for the tabernacle either directly or indirectly
Presently we are seriously lacking those who know how to care for the tabernacle in a fine way in order to carry the Lord's testimony
There will be a clear testimony to the Christians, to the unbelievers, and to the principalities and powers in the air
We shall be able to testify to all that the Lord has fulfilled His prophecy in Matthew 16:18 concerning the building of the church
We have seen that in the Lord's move on earth, there are two areas of function: fighting the battle and keeping the testimony
According to the picture in the Old Testament, those in the middle-aged group are the ones most necessary for the Lord's move
Today we need the young people to drive away the enemy and to gain more young people to secure the safety of the Lord's testimony
By studying the picture presented in the book of Numbers we can see what the responsibility of the middleaged brothers and sisters should be
A sister may be sixty years old as far as physical age is concerned but spiritually having been newly converted she may be only a month old
How refreshed we would be if several newly converted ones would stand up in the meeting and praise the Lord for their salvation!
Many who have had such an expectation have been disappointed when they were not appointed elders or service group leaders
The most important age group with respect to the tabernacle was the group between the ages of thirty and fifty
We need many saints experienced in Christ to take care of different aspects of Christ for the constitution of the church life
Do not wait for the elders to make arrangements or to decide who is qualified to have a Bible study in his home
Although the saints should not wait for the elders to make arrangements, they should not be rebellious or independent in what they do
The church needs the elders, but the elders should not do everything, for this will produce the clergy-laity system
As long as the saints are not rebellious or independent and as long as they are for the Lord's recovery, whatever they do is all right
If those in the maintenance service minister Christ to others in this way, this service will be full of Christ
Of ministering Christ to others, we care for the group itself and, for the sake of the group, we often make a selection among the saints
The church needs the elders, not to control the saints nor to do everything for them, but to fulfill their own duty
The saints are free to set up a Bible study in their homes or to engage in other spiritual activities to care for others
Every saint has the freedom to serve the Lord in the spirit as long as he is neither independent nor rebellious
Some, regarding this as a special service, were disappointed when they were not invited to serve in the business office
We should not be concerned about being in a so-called special service; rather, we should be concerned about taking care of others
We need to experience Christ in certain specific aspects and then help others to also have these experiences of Him
What a shame it is to have organization, selection, arrangements, and assignments without the experience of Christ!
If this is our practice in the church life, then at the Lord's table meeting many new ones will give testimonies full of reality
In the recovery today we are concerned for the experience of Christ and for the practice of the proper church life
In the following century, the Lord raised up the brothers in Great Britain for the further practice of the church life
If anyone still wants to dissent regarding doctrine, the church in the Lord's recovery is not the place for him
Verse 3 says Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats for God has received him
Regarding the receiving of believers, Paul said, 'Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God'
Although we may not be likeminded concerning so many things, we can be likeminded concerning Christ and the church
In the time of the Old Testament recovery, Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor, a descendant of David, are mentioned
When they became weak and the work of recovery ceased, the Lord raised up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to strengthen them
The main function of a prophet is not predicting the future; rather, a prophet speaks for God as His spokesman
Although they sometimes spoke concerning the future, most of the time they uttered words of rebuke, declaration, or condemnation
The prophets Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel did not repeat the teachings of others they spoke what was revealed to them directly by God
In order for the middle-aged ones to function normally, they need to set aside the ambition for leadership or eldership
If all the brothers are seeking the eldership, they will find a 'no vacancy' sign in front of the eldership 'motel'
The important matter is that you are willing to preach the gospel, to care for other Christians, or to edify the saints
As those in the Lord's recovery, our spirit and our motive must be pure, and we must do everything possible to avoid division
Although there is no need to gain the permission of the elders to function by opening your home, do not be individualistic in doing this
Do not teach foot-washing, head covering, or a certain view of the rapture, but teach concerning Christ and the church
Do not have the attitude that everyone in the church should take your way, and do not insist upon any certain way
Although some ways are better than others, those who take a better way should not insist that everyone do the same
In addition to all the matters we have already covered, we also need to point out the importance of loving others
Whether the formation of a party is intentional or not, the existence of a party in the church life is always damaging
Do not spend so much time with those who match your personal taste rather have fellowship with those who differ from your natural choice
A strong testimony of Christ and the church will defeat the enemy and pave the way for the Lord Jesus to come back
We have seen that in the church life there is the need not only for elders, but also for prophets, teachers, and exhorters
Brothers who love the Lord and have the ability to do something for the church have the subconscious desire to be elders
Many brothers endeavor to get into the room called 'eldership,' and many sisters want to enter the room called 'leading sisters'
The New Testament reveals that besides eldership there are many other functions the saints can fulfill according to their burden
Realizing that many needed to be warmed and comforted, they purposely sat next to new ones or weak ones in order to help them
The church needs shepherding; it does not need brothers and sisters to come together in special groups according to their preference
We have leading ones both in reality and in practicality, but we should not have titles or the consciousness of position
If we are truly for the Lord's recovery, we must crucify the flesh and never allow it to form a private intimacy
The spirituality in the church life is not a matter of being in a certain select group; it is a matter of ministering life
If we love the church, let us change our concept regarding leadership and take care of the members of the Body
Titles for two types of denominational organizations-Presbyterian and Episcopalian-are taken from these Greek words
Rather, along with possibly doing some cleaning himself, he should exercise the oversight of the cleaning work
Peter was an elder in one locality, whereas some of those addressed in his Epistle were elders in other localities
It implies that although the elders are in different localities, they should work together with one another as co-elders
Just as a mother shepherds her children by feeding them and caring for them, so we also need to shepherd God's children
Sisters, some of you have been in the Lord and in the church life for years, and you have attended many conferences and trainings
Now is the time to exercise yourselves to use the grace you have received and the gift you have been given to care for others
In the same principle, how can we be at rest until our brothers and sisters have been brought back to the church life?
In order to be in the Lord's glory and in His kingdom, we all must take grace and not repeat the damage caused by Christianity
Because we love Christ and the church, we should take Christ as our practical life and the church life as our practical living
Paul's word here was not only according to the revelation he had received, but also according to his experience
We may think that if every member of the church in Anaheim were a Peter, a Paul, or a John, the church would be wonderful
If we consider that a certain brother or sister is less honorable, then we need to clothe that one with more abundant honor
In order to clothe others with Christ, we need to experience Him in a rich way as our clothing, covering, and beautification
You may say, 'Sister, in our daily life we should not only follow the Lord Jesus, but also live by Him as our life
These verses speak of three kinds of members: the weaker ones, the less honorable or uncomely ones, and the comely ones
According to the Bible, we all must be tempered, the hot ones with the cold ones, and the spiritual ones with those who are not spiritual
In the proper church life there will always be the weaker members, the less honorable members, and the comely members
When Brother Nee was ministering on the matter of the Body in Shanghai, he emphasized the importance of seeing the Body
Do not think that the Body will receive some benefit if you select a few strong members of the Body and bring them together
God does not put all the weak ones into one group and all the strong ones into another group; instead, He tempers them by blending them
Verse 26 says, 'If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it'
The Body is built up with all the different members-the comely ones, the less honorable ones, and the weaker ones
Thessalonians 514 says We entreat you brothers admonish the disorderly console the fainthearted uphold the weak be longsuffering toward all
If we pay no attention to the disorderly ones among us, God will send in even more of them to show us that we cannot ignore them
If there were not this kind of person in the church, the Bible would not speak of consoling or comforting the little-souled ones
If a brother comes to you troubled because his wife is upset, do not say much to him and do not argue with him
Do not try to comfort the little-souled with mere human words, but comfort him with the Christ you have experienced in various aspects
In order to uphold the weak, or the infirm, we need to experience Christ as the boards, the pillars, and the sockets in the tabernacle
If you consider them by visiting them or by at least calling them on the telephone, you will incite them to love and good works
By shepherding, fellowshipping, teaching, comforting, and upholding others, they will bear the burden for the Lord's recovery today
