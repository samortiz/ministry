   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We are like the younger son in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day we came to God and said, "God, give me the share of the estate that falls to me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God gave us what we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After we took our estate, we squandered it with evil companions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we have come back to the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The robe, the ring, and the shoes that we wear and the fatted calf that we eat are not what we deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That which was rightfully ours has been spent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not deserve the ring.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not deserve the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not deserve to eat the fatted calf, and we do not deserve to wear the shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What then is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When those who do not deserve to be saved are saved, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace is what those who should not obtain have obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What the younger son took away the first time was not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He spent that already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What he received the second time was all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His own portion was long spent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he enjoys another meal at home, it is not what he deserves to get; it is the Father's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, if one works, the question of wages comes in, and it is no more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace is in conflict with what one deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How then does faith work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When it is not work or labor, but only faith in the God who justifies the sinner, that faith is reckoned as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the relationship between faith and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If it is work, then it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If it is grace, then there is only faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To believe is to accept what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not how much I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must emphasize that, before God, we are not justified by what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today we have justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the question of work is forever over.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who knows me well knows that I like soy sauce.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is all right if there are not many dishes at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as I have soy sauce, I can get by.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At one time, one who was serving me saw that my soy sauce was almost gone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He went to the market and brought more back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he mixed it in with the good soy sauce.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I tasted it, I noticed that the taste was different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I asked why the soy sauce tasted different that day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I checked with the serving one whether or not he had poured the soy sauce from the same bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He answered yes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I wondered if my taste had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It did not seem that likely.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I then asked if he had mixed it with something else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He had to admit that he had.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today man does the same thing to God's work and His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He tries to mix something else into them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we mix something in this way, grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is why God says that if it is of grace, then it is no more of work Rom 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it is of work, then it is no more of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Work can never be mixed with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we must not merely say that salvation is of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must say that salvation is solely of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I love Romans 3:27.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This word is based on verses 25 and 26 which speak of how the Lord Jesus has become a propitiation place and how God has justified those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not unrighteous for God to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, in verse 27 it says, "Where then is boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is excluded."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no way for us to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no possibility to boast anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The next sentence is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It says, "Through what kind of law?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that we have nothing to boast of anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By what way are we excluded from boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By what principle are we excluded from boasting?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 27 continues, "That of works?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No, but through the law of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul asked how man can be excluded from boasting and how boasting can be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His answer is by the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If one is in the principle of faith, then he is not in the principle of works.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If it is by the principle of works, then boasting cannot be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today we have the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, we cannot boast.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can only praise.</S>
