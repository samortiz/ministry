   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Locality Restricting the Formation of Divisions</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope the brothers and sisters will hold fast to this basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they do, they will be clear about the standing of the so-called denominations, churches, groups, and organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If any group is not built upon the ground of locality, we can see that it is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are we clear?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is this not amazing?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am amazed when I read this in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Going from the authority of the Holy Spirit to the boundary of locality seems like dropping ten thousand feet from the heavens all the way down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible reveals that the ground of the church is based on the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the Bible also shows us that just having the Holy Spirit is not enough; we also need the match of the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two together produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we look back, things become clearer and clearer, and more and more we have to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past two thousand years, if the people in the church had been willing to be limited by locality, there would not have been the difficulties and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If man had submitted to God's authority, neither Catholicism nor Protestantism could ever have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither could the more than one hundred denominations in China and more than six hundred major organizations and five thousand minor organizations in the world today have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All would have been restricted by the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Locality Never Being Subject to Change</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Excuse me for using political terms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A dynasty may change, but a locality never changes; a political party may change, but not a locality; a country may even change, but a locality does not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Shanghai has always remained Shanghai, and Ch'ang-ch'un has always remained Ch'ang-ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the Ching Dynasty, Shanghai was Shanghai; during the Republic, Shanghai was still Shanghai; even now Shanghai remains Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the Sino-Japanese War when the country almost became part of another country, the locality remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many things will change, but the locality will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wills the locality as the ground for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have the church in Rome as a locality, but never the church of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name is similar, but in fact they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church in the city of Rome is recognized by the Holy Spirit, but not the church of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, we must learn before God to keep the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please remember this one thing: The church must stand on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For many years we have been standing on this ground, rejecting all that is not in keeping with this ground, rejecting all other labels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Any group which does not take the locality as its ground is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The service we have entered into here is with the hope of building up the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If an inquiry is made about this matter by an outsider, we must make it clear to him that the church has the authority of the Holy Spirit inwardly as the content and the boundary of locality outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The authority of the Holy Spirit plus the boundary of locality make the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is no authority of the Holy Spirit within and no boundary of locality without, there is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Church Ground and Spiritual Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The clearer the ground of the church is, the richer are the spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these recent years and in particular during the past one or two years, we have seen God blessing the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many brothers and sisters have begun to see the difference between the way of individualism and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the authority of the Holy Spirit is manifested in all the members, causing them to serve God in coordination rather than in individual activities, we see the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In some local churches the members increase twofold, fivefold, and tenfold all in multiples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Originally there were only thirty or more members in Taipei, but now they have increased to over a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have sent some brothers there, and they have worked very diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has continued to bless, and the members have continued to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was in Hong Kong, I received a letter from a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I feel this brother knows what the church is because of the following incident.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church in Taipei expected Brother Witness to be responsible for their gospel campaign during the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After this decision was reached, Brother Witness had to come to see me in Hong Kong concerning some matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were really disappointed because they thought that they could not carry out the campaign themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brother Witness said to them, "To have Witness is just to have one more brother; to lose Witness is just to lose one brother."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is a church in Taipei, having or losing Brother Witness is just a matter of having or losing one brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if there were no church in Taipei, it would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the end, the brothers in Taipei preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some of the brothers who you would think could not preach the gospel preached the gospel contrary to expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, over fourteen hundred people received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the follow-up meetings, two hundred twenty-eight people were baptized on the first day alone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not matter whether a brother is taken away or added, because there is still the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now I will come back to that brother's letter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am very pleased with his statement: "I believe that if the brothers learn to serve the Lord in a coordinated way, whether there are three thousand or ten thousand newly saved ones, we will be able to absorb them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the church comes into being and begins to function, it can absorb five hundred new believers if five hundred come, and one thousand if one thousand come."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is God's church.</S>
