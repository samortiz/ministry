   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have two statuses: We have been joined to the Spirit to be one spirit 6:17.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We live by the Lord by living in our spirit 2:14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message we will fellowship concerning the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not care for methods, but we do have a certain way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should forsake all methods, but we should also walk on a way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where can we see the way to enjoy Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can find it in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians shows us that the way to enjoy Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we enjoy Christ in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us consider this matter step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CHRIST BEING THE PORTION OF ALL THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>WHO CALL UPON HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is theirs and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This phrase is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ belongs to us all!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ belongs to the brothers, and Christ belongs also to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ belongs to the elderly saints, and Christ belongs also to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ belongs to the strong ones, and Christ belongs also to the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse tells us that Christ belongs to all those who call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for call upon means to call out audibly, even loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, when a house is on fire, we call out, Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not simply shout; we call out for help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Someone once said to me, Brother Lee, the Lord is not so deaf that He cannot hear our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why do we need to cry and shout?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not think that we need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps there are others who think this as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not here to subdue you, but I must tell you the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider your experience from the day that you were saved until now.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have you ever called upon the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can confidently say that you have.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every Christian has called on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A few days ago I heard a testimony given by a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not long after she was saved, she was hit by a car and was in great pain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one had ever taught her to call on the Lord; nevertheless, she called, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After she had called on the Lord a few times, miraculously her pain went away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may say that you have never called upon the name of the Lord you even may be hard-hearted, but the Lord still has a way to deal with you, and when He does, you will call louder than everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To whom does Christ belong?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ belongs to those who call upon His name!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you call on the Lord, He becomes your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has given us Jesus Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has also called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ v. 9 . For us to be called into His fellowship is for us to be called into His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has not called us to go to heaven; He has called us to enter into His enjoyment, His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, every day we should enjoy the Lord, live in fellowship with the Lord, and take the Lord as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In addition to being our portion, the Lord is also the power of God and the wisdom of God v. 24 . To accomplish anything, we need power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For instance, suppose we want to establish a large corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To do so, we must have sufficient funds as capital.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our capital is our power.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, if we have sufficient funds but lack the intelligence to manage a company, we will not be able to accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our capital is our power, and our intelligence is our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have both, surely our corporation will prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The capital of the large corporation of God is simply Christ Himself, and the way, or wisdom, that God uses to manage this large corporation is also Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ is power and Christ is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As Christians we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Who put us in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God put us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God put us in Christ, and God wants Christ to become wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ becomes wisdom to us as righteousness for our past, as sanctification for our present, and as redemption for our future v. 30 . As our righteousness the Lord covers all of our shameful past, as our sanctification the Lord enables us to live a sanctified life in the present, and as our redemption the Lord will redeem and transfigure our body in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the way that the Lord becomes wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, we see that Christ is five major items: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In addition to these five major items Christ is another ten major items: the foundation 3:11 , the Passover 5:7 , our spiritual food, drink, and rock 10:3-4 , the Head 11:3 , the Body 12:12 , the firstfruits 15:20, 23 , the last Adam v. 45 , and the second man v. 47 . In other words, Christ is the first, the second, and the last.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, Christ is everything, Christ is all things, and there is nothing that is outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All of the grace of God is in Christ, and Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
