   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIGHT THAT GOD DESERVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Offering ourselves to God is also to grant Him the right that He deserves in regard to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 6:19-20 says that we are not our own because we have been bought with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This price is the precious blood shed by the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has bought us with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the Lord has purchased us, He has authority over us and we belong to Him, just as we own whatever we pay for.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Questions of use are never a factor in regard to the material things we own.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This, however, is not the case with those who have received grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although God has purchased us, He can be prevented from enjoying His right over us if we disagree with His use of us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, it is necessary for us to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consecration is our allowing God to have the right that He deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to say, Lord, since You bought me with a price, I do not belong to myself; I am Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I yield all authority to You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am Your bondslave.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From now on, You have authority over me and I give myself to You forever.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not want to run away or be unlawful, just as Onesimus was unlawful when he ran away from his master Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, I present myself to You; I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 14:7-8 says, None of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord s. We each belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We belong to God not only while we are living but also after we die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to consecrate ourselves to God as an acknowledgment of His authority over us and as an indication that we allow Him to have the right that He deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our consent to God s authority over us is because of His constraining love and because of the price He paid to purchase us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every new believer should indicate such willingness before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A BURNT OFFERING FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although our consecration to the Lord is for Him to use us to satisfy His wishes, we must first become a sacrifice before we can be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot be for God unless we have first become a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Becoming a sacrifice is a major step in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is possible for us to appear consecrated yet not be a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are three important points to being a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Change in Position</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once an offering is presented as a sacrifice, its position is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has lost its former position and is now on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter if it is a lamb or a bull, once it is offered as a sacrifice, its position is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was formerly with the flock or the herd; it is now on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Change in Use</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once an offering is presented as a sacrifice, its function or use is also changed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, a lamb or bull was used by people in the world, but once it is placed on the altar, it can no longer be used by them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is now for God s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, an offering that is presented as a sacrifice experiences not only a change in position but also a change in use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, consecration is not merely a matter of uttering a few sentences of prayer; consecration is to present oneself as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The result of this kind of consecration is that our position and use are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Formerly, we were in the world; now we are on God s altar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Formerly, we lived for our family, wife, husband, children, parents, and the world; now we live for God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all know that a sacrifice is not something common.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before being offered as a sacrifice, any object is common.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once it is offered as a sacrifice, however, it is separated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, once a person consecrates himself, he is separated unto God; he is a living sacrifice presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His position is changed, and his use is changed as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A Change in Appearance</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything that is presented as a sacrifice must pass through the process of God s dealings, especially if it is presented as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The sacrifice spoken of in Romans 12:1 focuses on the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order for a bull or a lamb to be presented as a burnt offering, it must be slaughtered, flayed, cut into pieces, washed, laid on the altar, and consumed by fire until it becomes a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A sacrifice that is burnt to ashes has been thoroughly dealt with; even if there are further dealings, it will remain a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At this point the sacrifice is a sweet savor for God s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a pity that many Christians are willing to consecrate themselves to God but are unwilling to be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are like bulls or lambs that have not been slaughtered, flayed, cut into pieces, washed, or consumed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They remain untouched and unchanged; they remain entirely natural.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only those who have been dealt with by God are for God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only after God has dealt with us in this way can our service be in resurrection, no longer a natural service.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only after we have been dealt with by God in this way can our work be in resurrection and a sweet savor unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many people today love the Lord zealously.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although they have consecrated themselves to God, they still have a very strong natural flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is because they are unwilling to be stripped by God; they have not allowed God to consume them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They cannot be used by God because their self is unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God cannot use their bad qualities nor even their good qualities because these qualities are still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A person can be used by God only when he has been dealt with by God, just as a sacrifice must be slaughtered, flayed, cut into pieces, washed, and burned to ashes until its appearance is completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At this point his position, use, and appearance have all changed, and he has become a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the eyes of men these ashes are nothing, but to God they are a sweet savor.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only this kind of person can be for God and can be used by God to satisfy His wishes.</S>
