Yet most of them merely know that this book is wonderful; they cannot tell why it is so wonderful. The Psalms are indeed very impressive to the reader. Whoever reads the Psalms is touched. The reason the Psalms are so touching is because they are not mere teachings; they are the sentiments and impressions of the godly saints in their experiences. Moreover, these expressions are uttered in praises to God, not in ordinary talk. These are not praises according to doctrine, but praises according to the feelings and impressions which the godly saints have derived from their experiences. Therefore, we may define the Psalms as follows:<p>They are the expression, in their praises to God, of the sentiments and impressions of the godly saints in their experiences, in and through which Christ is revealed and the Church as God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s city is typified.<p>In the Psalms Christ is revealed, but we cannot say that the church is revealed, because in the Psalms the church is still hidden as a mystery. Therefore we can say only that the church is typified. In the types we see something of the church as the house of God and as the city of God. But it was not prophesied, predicted, or revealed.<p>The Psalms are so inspiring and impressive, firstly, because they are praises. All the writings of the Psalms are in the form of praises. Secondly, all these praises were not composed by knowledge, doctrine or understanding of teachings. They were composed with the sentiments and impressions of experiences, many experiences. Whenever we speak of our experience, there is something inspiring, and it will be impressive. On the contrary, whenever we utter mere doctrine, there is no inspiration. We need to speak out of our experiences. The Psalms are the expressions, sentiments and impressions of experiences. Thirdly, all the Psalms are the expression of godly saints in their praises, not an expression of gossiping people. I use these two words in a very special way-godly saints. The Psalms are the expression of their praises.<h2 class=head1>GOD SPEAKS IN THE SAINTS&#8217; SPEAKING</h2><p>Now we must see an exceedingly important matter. Because the writers of the Psalms are godly saints, because they are praising, and because they are expressing something of their sentiments and their experiences, they are very close to God. Because of their nearness and openness to God, they provide a way for God to utter something within their utterance. While they are speaking, God comes and speaks in and through their utterance. This point is of great importance. The Psalms are the expression of the godly saints; yet in their expression the door is open for the Lord to speak; the opportunity is given for God to utter something in their utterance. It is for this very reason that some find it difficult to understand the Psalms. On the one hand they are the expression of the godly saints, and yet on the other hand they are the expression of God Himself.<p>For example, the authorship of Psalm 2 is not mentioned; by itself no one can know who wrote it. At the heading of most of the Psalms the author&#8217;s name is mentioned, but not Psalm 2. Surely God was not the scribe. Surely Christ was not the writer. In any case, regardless of the authorship, we have verse 7, &#8220;I will declare the decree...&#8221; Who is this &#8220;I&#8221;? Who is it that said, &#8220;The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&#8221; When we come to the New Testament, in the Acts and in Hebrews, we are clearly told that this word was spoken by the Lord Jesus after He was resurrected. The &#8220;I&#8221; here is Christ, but Christ was not the writer of this Psalm. Acts 4:25 reveals that this Psalm was written by David. David was the author. How then could he say, &#8220;I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee&#8221;? David could say this because he was so godly, so near to Christ, and so open to God that he paved the way and opened the door for the Spirit of Christ to enter into his utterance. When he was praising, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, uttered something in his utterance of praising. We must keep this point in mind; it is exceedingly vital. Many times in the Psalms the Spirit of Christ entered into the utterances of the writers to utter something. On the one hand it was and still is the utterance of the writers, but on the other hand it is the utterance of Christ.<h2 class=head1>TWO CONCEPTS-HUMAN AND DIVINE</h2><p>All the Psalms are the expressions of the godly saints drawn from their experiences. The writers, being godly saints, did their utmost to utter something in praise to God according to their experiences. Of course, this kind of utterance was based upon their concept of God. They had the experiences, they had the sentiments, they had the impressions to utter something as their expression, and this expression was certainly based upon their own concept. But because they were so close to God and open to Him, God was free to utter something in their utterance. However, God&#8217;s utterance was not based upon their concept, but upon the divine concept. We must realize that in the Psalms there are two kinds of concepts: the concept of the saints and the concept of God, the human concept and the divine, the natural concept and the spiritual. These two are always together in the Psalms. But do not imagine that they are complementary. These two concepts are incompatible and mutually contradictory.<p>Psalm 1 says in effect, &#8220;Blessed is the man that keeps the law.&#8221; This is the expression of a saint according to his concept, and his concept is one of the law. His delight is in the law. But while he was uttering Psalm 1 and then Psalm 2, God, Christ, and the Spirit of God came in to say, not, &#8220;Blessed is the man that keeps the law,&#8221; but, &#8220;Blessed are all that put their trust in the Son (Christ).&#8221; While the Psalmist was saying, &#8220;Blessed is the man that keeps the law,&#8221; the Lord entered in to declare, &#8220;Blessed is the man who puts his trust in the Son.&#8221; You see, the Psalmist was uttering something according to his concept, but because he was so near to God and open to Him, God could intervene and within his utterance utter something according to the divine concept. This is the way the Psalmists wrote the Psalms. The Psalmists spoke according to their concept, but, when God suddenly uttered something within their utterance, the concept was changed. This is an exceedingly important principle in the understanding of the Psalms.<h2 class=head1>THE CENTER AND CONTENT</h2><p>Now we must consider the center and the content of all the praises in the Psalms. From the human point of view it is one thing, and from the divine it is another. According to the human concept it is one thing, but according to the divine it is another. From the human standpoint, we may say that the center and content of all the Psalms are the experiences of the saints concerning God&#8217;s mercy, kindness, love, faithfulness, power, and glory. They experienced so much of God&#8217;s goodness that they praised God with all these aspects of their experience of God. This is the human concept, this is the human point of view. But according to the divine concept and the divine point of view, the center and content of all the praises are Christ, the house and the city of God. Christ is the center, and the church, typified by the house and the city, is also the center. Christ and the church are the center and content of all the praises of the Psalms. Therefore, in all our praises we must have the sentiments and impressions gathered from our experience; yet in all our praises we must have Christ and the church as the center and the content.<p>Many of us have been in the atmosphere of Christianity and under its influence for years. Christian teachers always declare that the Psalms are sweet and comforting. If you are in any trouble, they say, read the Psalms and you will be comforted. It is true that the Psalms are indeed a comfort, but if we merely apply the Psalms for our comfort, we fail greatly and come far short of their intent. The Psalms were not written in this way; they were written as praise to God with Christ as the center. Christ Himself told His disciples that in the books of Moses, in the prophets, and in all the Psalms, many things were written concerning Him (Luke 24:44). It is a great pity that so many Christians merely apply the Psalms for comfort. Very few apply the Psalms for the experience of Christ.<p>We should realize that when we come to the church meetings, we must praise. Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 tell us that we must be in the Spirit, always praising with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. You may say that you have been doing this, but, I would ask what the center of your praise is. Most of the praises I have heard have the mercy, goodness, and lovingkindness of God as the center. You cannot touch much of Christ in the prayers and praises of most Christians today. You cannot hear much concerning the church as the house and the city of God in the praises of most Christians today. We must be transformed in the matter of our praising. We must all come to the meeting to praise the Lord, not with the concept merely of what we have obtained of the goodness and lovingkindness of God as the center, but continually with Christ and with the church as the house and city of God as the center. Brothers and sisters, this is tremendously vital. This is something deeper. People today talk so much about the deeper life. I tell you, this is the deeper life and these are the deeper praises.<p>It is exceedingly difficult for saints to rid themselves of their old concepts. We are always thinking of how good and merciful the Lord is to us. That is well, but we must realize that whenever we praise God, our praises must be Christ-centered and church-centered. Let us say, &#8220;Hallelujah, Lord, how good that I am in the local church! Day by day I am enjoying Christ as my comfort in the local church.&#8221; In such a praise comfort is mentioned, but comfort is not the center; Christ and the church are the center. I simply enjoy Christ day by day, and I have comfort in the local church. So many times Christians today forget about Christ, and they do not have the church. All they have and all they can say is something concerning their individual comfort.<p>I am certain that if we are close to the Lord and open to Him, while we are praising, &#8220;O Father, Thou art so good; please comfort me,&#8221; the Spirit of God will say something, not according to our concept, but according to His. While we are saying, &#8220;How good, how good,&#8221; then Christ and the church will come into our praise. We all must be so near to God and open to Him that the Spirit may easily utter something within our utterance concerning Christ and the church.<p>This little word of introduction is intensely vital for our understanding of the Psalms.<h2 class=head1>DIVISIONS OF THE BOOK</h2><p>All the 150 Psalms are divided into five separate books, each of which is composed of a number of Psalms with a distinctive point of spiritual significance.<p>Book I: composed of Psalms 1 to 41, indicates how God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God.<p>Book II: composed of Psalms 42 to 72, indicates how the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ.<p>Book III: composed of Psalms 73 to 89, indicates how the saints, in their experiences, realize that the house and the city of God with all the enjoyments thereof can only be preserved and maintained with Christ properly appreciated and exalted by God&#8217;s people.<p>Book IV: composed of Psalms 90 to 106, indicates how the saints, being joined to Christ, are one with God so that He can recover His title over the earth through Christ in His house and city.<p>Book V: composed of Psalms 107 to 150, indicates how the house and city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints, and how Christ comes to reign over the whole earth through the house and the city of God.<p>By looking into the main points of the five books, we can easily realize that they are not only in a very meaningful sequence, but also with a consecutive progress or improvement until they reach the climax of the divine revelation they afford us.<p>The first Psalm of each book represents the concept of that book. For instance, the first Psalm of Book I represents the concept of the law. Look into the first Psalm of each book, and you will see the improvement. Let us consider several verses from these Psalms. Book II begins, &#8220;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God&#8221; (Psa. 42:1). Compare this verse with the beginning of Book I, and you will see the difference. There is further improvement with the beginning of Book III: &#8220;Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a pure heart&#8221; (Psa. 73:1). There is even more improvement when we come to the beginning of Book IV: &#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations&#8221; (Psa. 90:1). Do you see the difference? Finally, Book V begins on the highest plane of all: &#8220;O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever&#8221; (Psa. 107:1). And the last, glorious word of the Psalms is, &#8220;Praise ye the Lord.&#8221; That is, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; I am afraid the last word of the Psalms of many Christians is, &#8220;Blessed is the man who keeps the law.&#8221; But in the real Psalms, the closing word is, &#8220;Hallelujah, praise ye the Lord!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>BOOK I-PSALMS 1 TO 41</h2><p>As Book I indicates how God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ, so at the beginning it presents a contrast between the first two psalms. Read Psalms 1 and 2 together. Do you see the difference in these two psalms? One is concerning the law and is according to the human concept of the godly saints, whereas the other is concerning Christ and is according to the divine concept of God.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 1-THE CONCEPT OF THE SAINTS CONCERNING THE LAW</h2><p>I know you will say that Psalm 1 is an excellent Psalm, and all Christians would agree. I know you are all for it, but you are for it according to the human concept. Do you really think that Psalm 1 is so good? Yes, it is good according to your concept, the natural and human concept of the law.<p>The book of Job comes just before the book of Psalms. What would Job say concerning Psalm 1? In Psalm 1 the writer says, &#8220;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&#8221; At this point Job would immediately interrupt to say that the writer is wrong. He would say, &#8220;I am one who day and night delights in the law of the Lord. But I can testify that whatever I have done did not prosper. Whatever I did brought trouble. You are just like one of my three friends. One of them said the same thing, &#8216;If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways&#8217; (Job 22:23, 28).&#8221; The thought and concept of Job&#8217;s three friends is the same as the concept in Psalm 1. Job may also refer the writer of Psalm 1 to his book, chapter ten, verses 7 and 8, &#8220;Thou knowest that I am not wicked, and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.&#8221; What could the writer of Psalm 1 answer to that? All the talks of Job&#8217;s three friends and the writer of Psalm 1 are in the same vein: &#8220;If you keep the law, if you are not wicked, if you turn yourself to the Lord, if you do His will, you will prosper.&#8221; Job has another friend in the writer of Psalm 1. Job has many friends-you are all Job&#8217;s friends. At least one person in the whole universe is against the concept of Psalm 1. Job will say, &#8220;Do not say this. Whatever you do will not prosper. Your word does not work for me.&#8221;<p>God is not for the law. Even the law in the book of Moses is not for the law. The law is for Christ. Poor saints! Poor godly saints! Poor us! We just have the human concept! We think that if we keep the law, if we do nothing wrong, if we are good and delight in the law day and night, then whatever we do will prosper. This is a natural, human concept. It is not true to real experience. The more Job endeavored to be right, the more he suffered. Brothers and sisters, we must be clear concerning this.<p>The godly saints were not accurate in their concept, but in their person they were so close to the Lord and open to Him. As they were expressing their sentiments and impressions, the Spirit of Christ came in to continue their expression, not according to their concept, but according to the concept of God.<p>In Psalm 1 there are two points: (1) Blessed is the man that keeps the law, and (2) the way of the ungodly shall perish. These are the two features of the human concept of the writer. The conclusion of Psalm 2 is that all they that put their trust in Christ are blessed, and that we should &#8220;kiss the Son, lest he be angry.&#8221; Have you seen the difference between Psalm 1 and Psalm 2? Psalm 1 declares that whether you will be blessed or perish depends on whether you keep the law. If you keep it, you will be blessed; if you do not keep it, you will perish. The declaration of Psalm 2 is absolutely different. Whether you will be blessed or not, whether you will perish or not, depends upon whether you put your trust in Christ and kiss Him. If you put your trust in Christ, you are blessed. If you kiss Him, it means that you love Him, and you will never perish. The concept of Psalm 1 is the law, but the concept in Psalm 2 is Christ. Have you seen this? God is not for the law, but for Christ.<p>Then what about Psalm 1? Let us leave it there and go on to Psalm 2. If you are still remaining in Psalm 1 and stand for it, you are still in the human concept, the concept of the law; you have not yet received the divine revelation of Christ. In the eyes of God, whether or not you are blessed, whether or not you will perish, depends not on the law, but absolutely on Christ. If you trust Him and love Him, you are blessed. Forget about the law. The apostle Paul tells us that we were crucified to the law. We are dead to the law (Rom. 7:4; Gal. 2:19). That means that we have nothing to do with the law. I am living with Christ; do not talk to me about the law. It is not a matter of keeping the law or delighting in the law, but of putting my trust in Christ and kissing Him.<p>To put your trust in Christ is an Old Testament term; the New Testament counterpart is to believe in Christ. To kiss Him is the Old Testament term; the New Testament counterpart is to love Him. Jesus said to Peter, &#8220;Lovest thou me more than these?&#8221; In the Old Testament language, that means, &#8220;Do you kiss me?&#8221; It is not a matter today of keeping the law, but absolutely a matter of putting our trust in Christ and kissing Him. We have to believe in Him and love Him. As long as we put our trust in Him and kiss Him, that will be truly wonderful. Psalm 1 is for the law, and Psalm 2 is for Christ; part of the Psalms are of the human concept, and part of the divine concept; part are the expression of the godly saints, and part are the declarations of God.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 2-THE DECLARATION OF GOD CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p>The twelve verses of Psalm 2 can be divided into four sections, with three verses in each section. The first three verses predict the opposition of the world rulers to Christ. This prophecy began to be fulfilled at the time Christ was judged by Pilate. Its fulfillment will be continued until the time indicated in Revelation 19, verse 19. At the time Jesus was betrayed, the rulers, the kings, the princes of this earth, began to oppose Him. So this Psalm says, &#8220;Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth stand up, and the princes plot together, against the Lord, and against his anointed.&#8221; This includes all the Caesars of the Roman Empire. It includes, in the following centuries, all the rulers, kings and princes of this earth who arise and plot against Christ. Acts 4:25-27 refers to this prophecy. It is the prediction of the opposition of world leaders to Christ from the time of His crucifixion till the time the antichrist will be defeated by Christ.<p>The second section is God&#8217;s declaration (vv. 4-6). Verse 4: &#8220;He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh.&#8221; While those Roman Caesars were plotting against Christ, God was sitting in the heavens laughing. While the other world rulers were plotting against Christ, God undoubtedly was in the heavens laughing at them and having them in derision. Hitler was in violent opposition to Christ. But where is he today? Where are the Roman Caesars? Where will today&#8217;s Christ opposing rulers be a few years from now? God is laughing and saying, &#8220;What are you doing? Your opposition can only last a few fleeting years.&#8221; The princes and kings arise and fight against Christ, but eventually God will destroy them. &#8220;Then shall he speak unto them in his anger and terrify them in his fierce displeasure.&#8221; And God said, &#8220;Yet have I anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness.&#8221; This is the declaration of God.<p>The third section, verses 7 through 9, is the declaration of Christ Himself. Christ declared something. He said, &#8220;I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&#8221; Both Acts 13 and Hebrews 1 tell us that this word refers to the resurrection of Christ. Christ was begotten as the Son of God by being resurrected. Then He ascended to the heavens, where He asked of the Father, and the Father gave Him all the nations as His inheritance. God granted to Him the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession. And God said, &#8220;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&#8217;s vessel.&#8221;<p>The last section, verses 10 to 12, is the gospel preaching. &#8220;Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be admonished, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.&#8221; This simply means to repent and believe. &#8220;Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way...Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.&#8221; The last three verses of Psalm 2 are the gospel.<p>These four sections, the section predicting the opposition against Christ, the section predicting God&#8217;s declaration concerning Christ, the section predicting Christ&#8217;s declaration about Himself, and the section predicting the gospel preaching include all the things related to Christ. We need to have the concept of such a Christ. Regardless of how much the world opposes Christ, God has appointed Him, God has anointed Him, and He has declared that now we must preach Him. We must tell the people to be wise, to repent, to fear and rejoice with trembling, to put their trust in Him and love Him. This is the gospel preaching.<p>Which Psalm do you now prefer, Psalm 1 or Psalm 2? When I was first saved, the first chapter of the Bible I learned to recite was Psalm 1. No one ever told me anything about Psalm 2. Christianity today still has only the human concept, the natural concept, the concept of the law. But we must drop this. We must take the divine concept, the spiritual concept, the concept of Christ. Though He is being opposed today, yet God has declared that He is the Anointed One, that He is resurrected, that He will obtain all the nations as His inheritance and rule over them. What have we to do but praise Him, be wise, be admonished, fear and rejoice with trembling, put our trust in Him and kiss Him. Then we will be blessed and never perish!<p class=hbody>Lo, the nations all assemble<br>And imagine vanity,<br>Kings and princes plot together<br>&#8217;Gainst the Lord in unity.<br>&#8220;Let us break their bonds asunder,<br>Cast away their cords from us.&#8221;<br>&#8217;Gainst the Lord and His Anointed<br>Worldly rulers counsel thus.</p><p class=hbody>He who sitteth in the heavens<br>In contempt will laugh at them,<br>Vex them in His fierce displeasure,<br>Terrifying all such men.<br>Yet upon the hill of Zion<br>God has His anointed King-<br>This is God&#8217;s own declaration,<br>All the kings admonishing.</p><p class=hbody>Now &#8217;tis Christ, &#8216;tis God&#8217;s Anointed,<br>Who declares the Lord&#8217;s decree:<br>&#8220;Thou&#8217;rt my Son (in resurrection),<br>This day I&#8217;ve begotten Thee.<br>All the nations I will give Thee<br>For Thine own inheritance.<br>Thou shalt dash them into pieces<br>In Thy kingly excellence.&#8221;</p><p class=hbody>Now be wise, O be instructed,<br>All ye rulers of the earth,<br>Fear the Lord, rejoice with trembling,<br>Serve the only One of worth.<br>Kiss the Son, lest He be angry<br>And ye perish in the way.<br>&#8220;All who trust in Him are blessed,&#8221;<br>All who trust in Him will say.</p><p class=hbody>Lord, we praise Thee, we have seen Him-<br>Thy unique Anointed One-<br>And from vanity repenting,<br>We in love have kissed Thy Son.<br>&#8220;All who trust in Him are blessed&#8221;-<br>Not &#8220;all those who keep the law.&#8221;<br>In that risen One believing,<br>We are blest forevermore.</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #1094)</p><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST-THE ANSWER TO HUMAN PROBLEMS</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 3 to 8</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 3:4; 5:7, 11; 8:1-9; Heb. 2:6-10; Eph. 1:22-23</h1><p>Now we proceed from Psalm 2 to Psalm 8. If you have not seen the difference between Psalm 1 and Psalm 2, it is rather difficult to go on to Psalm 8. Therefore, before going on to Psalm 8, we must dwell a little more upon Psalms 1 and 2. In chapter one we boldly declared that Psalm 1 is not so positive, especially to us as Christians today. If you are for Psalm 1, you should be an Old Testament saint. You do not belong here. In the church life we must have the New Testament saints, not the Old Testament ones.<h2 class=head1>THE LAW VERSUS CHRIST</h2><p>We have pointed out that in Book I of the Psalms, God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God. It is certain that if you are for the law, it is rather difficult for you to enter the house to enjoy God. We must turn from the law to Christ; then we will be in the house of God and enjoy all His riches.<p>The book of Galatians was written for the very purpose of showing us the difference between the law and Christ. At the time of its writing the Jewish elders were doing their utmost to bring the concept of the law into the churches as a distraction from Christ, a substitute for Christ. Hence, the apostle Paul wrote this letter, telling the saints that the law is something of the past. Now Christ is for us. We are not for the law; we are now for Christ.<p>Galatians 3:24 says that the law was our schoolmaster, or, according to a better translation, our child conductor. (See Conybeare&#8217;s translation of the Epistles of the apostle Paul.) In ancient times, according to Jewish custom, the parents sent their children to a teacher living in a certain house by means of a servant as a child conductor. Paul here likens the law to the child conductor. &#8220;The law was our child conductor to bring us unto Christ.&#8221; Christ is the teacher; the law is the conductor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by faith. &#8220;But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a child conductor&#8221; (v. 25). Christ is come, and Christ dwells in us. The conductor is past; we need the conductor no longer.<p>Galatians 5:4 says, &#8220;Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.&#8221; This is a serious matter. If you attempt to keep the law, Christ is become of no effect to you, and you are fallen from grace. Are you still for the law? If so, the consequence is terrible.<p>The problem of the law issues mainly from two sources: (1) our human, natural, and religious concept, and (2) the poverty of even fundamental Christianity. Many times in Christendom, after people have been brought to grace, they have been helped immediately to keep the law. They have been ushered into a situation of half-grace and half-law. Christians say that they know grace, but they know only fifty percent grace, and, I venture to say, even less than fifty percent. Grace must be one hundred percent; there is no element of law in grace. If you are still for the law, you are fallen from grace. This is not my word or teaching, but my quotation from the holy Word. This is the very concept of God Himself in His Word, especially the New Testament.<p>In Galatians 2:19, Paul said, &#8220;For I through the law am dead to the law.&#8221; Why do you love the law so much? Are you married to the law? I know that when I say Psalm 1 is not so good, many of you will disagree. The first time I spoke of Psalm 1 in this way was in 1956. At that time I offended a number of people. If we did not have the New Testament, but only the Psalms, you may win the case. But today, hallelujah, we have the Psalms, and we also have the New Testament. The Old Testament is just a picture book; the New Testament is the definition. I have the boldness to say that this concept is right, because it is the concept of the New Testament. Through the law I am dead to the law. How could your Christian conscience justify you in delighting in the law? Through the law I am dead to the law; I have nothing to do with the law that I might live unto God. &#8220;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20).<p>Let us go on to Romans 10:4. &#8220;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.&#8221; Are you clear concerning the law? Christ is the end of the law. Then what about Psalm 1? Psalm 2 is the end of Psalm 1. If you have Psalm 2, you may forget about Psalm 1.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the mountain of transfiguration, Peter spoke nonsense. He said, &#8220;Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah&#8221; (Matt. 17:4). Moses was the representative of the law, and Elijah the representative of the prophets. After Peter spoke these words, there came a voice from the heavens, saying, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.&#8221; Then Moses and Elijah disappeared; only Christ was there. And we read that when they had lifted up their eyes, &#8220;they saw no man, save Jesus only.&#8221; There was no more law, no more prophets, only Christ. You see, if you still treasure Psalm 1, it means that you are pitching two tents, one for Christ and one for Moses. That is nonsense. We must hear the voice from the heavens, saying, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, hear ye him&#8221;-only Christ!<p>We may even be so bold as to say that we must put Psalm 2 upon our head and Psalm 1 under our feet. How could we put part of the Bible under our feet? This is not my thought, but the thought of the Bible itself. Turn to Revelation 12. There we see a wonderful, universal woman. &#8220;And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars&#8221; (v. 1). This woman represents all the chosen people of God; she will eventually become the New Jerusalem. She is clothed with the sun, the moon is under her feet, and upon her head are twelve stars. What are these? They are three different dispensations: the dispensation of the sun, the dispensation of the moon, and the dispensation of the twelve stars. Undoubtedly, the New Testament age is the sun. The moon is the Old Testament, the age of the law. The moon is good, but it is much inferior to the sun; likewise, the law is good, but it is far inferior to the New Testament. Now we are in the age of the sun; the age of the moon, the law, is under our feet. The dispensation of the stars is the age of the patriarchs. These are the three dispensations. The age of the patriarchs was the period of the forefathers before the law, from the time of Adam or Abel to Moses. Then from Moses to Christ is the age of the moon-that is the night time. Then Christ came; Christ is the sun. When Christ came, the day dawned, the sun arose. We must realize the position of the law. The age of the law is under our feet. This is the concept of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>NEW TESTAMENT QUOTATIONS OF PSALM 2</h2><p>Sixty percent of Psalm 2 has been quoted by the New Testament, either directly or indirectly. The thought of Psalm 2 is the same as that of the New Testament; thus, in a sense, you may find every part of Psalm 2 there. If you put all the New Testament parts together, you will have another Psalm 2. Let us look briefly at some of these verses in the New Testament that we may be more deeply impressed.<p>We have seen that the first section of Psalm 2, verses 1 to 3, is the opposition of world rulers against Christ. It began to be fulfilled at the time Christ was betrayed and brought to the judgment of Pilate. This is recorded in Acts 4:25-28: &#8220;Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.&#8221; This fulfillment will continue to the time of Revelation 19:19. &#8220;And I saw the beast (this beast is the coming antichrist), and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.&#8221; Christ was the One sitting on the horse, and the antichrist, the kings and all the armies were making war against Him. This will be the final attempt of world rulers to oppose Christ, Praise the Lord! The fulfillment of the first section of Psalm 2 began with Pontius Pilate and will be ended with the beast, the antichrist.<p>In the second section of Psalm 2, God declared that He has anointed Christ as His king on Zion, the hill of His holiness. Here we must read Acts 2:36, &#8220;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.&#8221; This is God&#8217;s declaration. Now, Revelation 19:16, 20, and 21: &#8220;And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KlNGS, AND LORD OF LORDS...And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.&#8221; Then Revelation 20:4, &#8220;And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&#8221; This declaration of God in the second section of Psalm 2 lasts so long-from the time Jesus was resurrected and ascended God made this declaration; it is still continuing and prevailing, and it will do so till the thousand years of the kingdom will come. On the other hand, along with His declaration, God has accomplished and will accomplish much destruction upon the enemy: He has destroyed the Roman Empire and many other worldly powers trying to oppose Christ.<p>The third section of Psalm 2 is Christ&#8217;s declaration. Let us read Acts 13:33, &#8220;God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.&#8221; &#8220;This day&#8221; is the day of resurrection. This same verse is quoted in Hebrews 1:5. In Psalm 2 Christ declared that God the Father will give Him all the nations as His inheritance. That word is fulfilled in Revelation 11:15, &#8220;And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.&#8221; Psalm 2:9 concerning Christ&#8217;s rule is fulfilled in Revelation 2:26 and 27: &#8220;He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.&#8221; And again in Revelation 19:15, &#8220;Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron.&#8221;<p>Revelation 6:15-17 is the fulfillment of the last section of Psalm 2, the gospel preaching, admonishing people to return to Christ, to put their trust in Christ and to kiss Christ, for His wrath will be kindled. &#8220;The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?&#8221; This is not a direct quotation from Psalm 2, but the thought, the concept, is adopted from Psalm 2. One day Christ will be angered; the wrath of the Lamb will be exercised. The kings must be wise and put their trust in Him.<p>If you would properly understand Psalm 8, you must keep Psalm 2 within you. Psalm 2 tells us that Christ is the center of God&#8217;s economy, the center of God&#8217;s administration. God declared to the whole earth, &#8220;Yet have I anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness.&#8221; Do not care for many things; only care for this: God has declared that He has anointed, installed, and established Christ as the King. I do not think there could be any word more clear than Psalm 2. It is so brief, yet so strong. There is God&#8217;s declaration, then Christ&#8217;s declaration, and then the gospel preaching.<h2 class=head1>PSALMS 3 THROUGH 7-A MIXTURE</h2><p>But after this clear word, there are Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. What about these Psalms? Are they good or bad? It is rather difficult to say. They are a mixture-some parts are good, and some parts are poor. By reading these five Psalms-3, 4, 5, 6 and 7-you may obtain their main concept: the saints, based upon their concept of the law and trusting in God&#8217;s righteousness, ask God to judge their adversaries on the earth. Is this good or not? I feel that if we have all become clear concerning Psalm 2, we do not need these five Psalms. Immediately after Psalm 2, we may sing, &#8220;Victory, victory, hallelujah!&#8221; There is no need for us to plead with God, &#8220;O God, you are so righteous; O God, how many enemies I have on this earth! O God, you must do something for me!&#8221; This is Psalms 3 through 7. After the decisive and glorious declaration of Psalm 2, certainly such pitiful pleas are not necessary. But we are guilty of the same thing. Sometimes after we hear a message which is strong and clear, we still persist in crying, &#8220;O Lord, O Lord, how terrible is the enemy; he is after me day and night; O Lord, help me!&#8221; This is the story of these five Psalms. Following Psalm 2, a poor situation still prevails among the seeking saints.<p>But listen, even in this low level, in this poor situation, the saints still realize that there is something in the house of God, that God has heard their cry and answered their prayer from the hill of His holiness. What is the hill of His holiness? It is the very place of God&#8217;s house. Sometimes, although we may be begging God to be merciful to us in this matter and in that, yet we realize at the same time how good it is to be in the local church. We still enjoy the house of God, the local church. So the saints said, &#8220;I cry unto the Lord with my voice, and he answereth me out of the hill of his holiness&#8221; (Psa. 3:4). And again, &#8220;But as for me, I will enter thy house in the abundance of thy lovingkindness: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple&#8221; (Psa. 5:7). They were not so clear, but still they enjoyed the house of God.<p>Therefore, Psalms 3 to 7 are not too bad, but still they are not so good. When we go on from Book I of the Psalms to Book II, we will see the improvement. Then from Book II to Book III, we will see still more improvement. From Book III to Book IV there is even further improvement. And from Book IV to Book V, the situation among the saints is improved to the uttermost. When we reach the last book of the Psalms, the begging is over. There is only praising-hallelujah, hallelujah! Do not be offended by my remarks concerning the opening Psalms. Be patient and read till the end of the book-you will see the issue. I beg you, please hold your judgment until the end.<p>After Psalm 2 we still have these five, we may say, mixed Psalms-not so clear, not so good, yet still containing something of the enjoyment of God&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 8-CHRIST IN THE PRAISE OF EXCELLENCY</h2><p>Praise the Lord that after Psalms 3 to 7 we come to Psalm 8! &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; What a difference is this! &#8220;Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings (not the giants, but the babes, the sucklings, the little ones) hast thou established praise.&#8221; No begging, no prayer, no supplication, just praise. The little ones, the sucklings, can praise, and this praise silences the enemy. In all the foregoing Psalms we read, &#8220;O God, O God, many are they that rise up against me! My enemies, my enemies, O Lord, O God!&#8221; But when we come to Psalm 8, it is marvelous! The praises out of the babes, out of the sucklings, shut the enemy&#8217;s mouth. There is no need for us to beg; there is no need for us to cry and to ask; we only need to praise. Our praises will silence the enemy. Do not say, &#8220;Oh, oh, how many enemies there are!&#8221; Don&#8217;t be so foolish. To do so is just as foolish as remaining in a dark room when you have electricity in an electrical light. You would not say, &#8220;O God, how dark is this place! O God, be merciful to me, I am in darkness!&#8221; You would simply switch on the light! God is in you. Don&#8217;t you have Him? Don&#8217;t cry, don&#8217;t beg, don&#8217;t be so pitiful. Shout hallelujah and turn on the &#8220;electricity&#8221;! To cry and to beg is Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. To shout hallelujah and turn on the Lord is Psalm 8. &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established praise...that thou mightest still the enemy.&#8221; Hallelujah!<p>But you must realize that this praise is related to Christ. If there is no electricity in the room, regardless of how much you shout hallelujah, regardless of how much time you spend flicking the switch, it will not work; the room will still be dark, still void of light. Your hallelujahs are based on the electricity; our praises are based upon Christ. If there were no Christ in the universe, we would really have cause to weep. We could not praise, and even if we did, it would not work. But, praise the Lord, we do have Christ! Hallelujah, we do have Christ! And what a Christ! The Christ in this Psalm is unspeakable and full of glory. In Psalm 8 we have the incarnation of Christ, the ascension of Christ, the enthronement of Christ, the Lordship, the Headship, and the Kingdom of Christ. In addition to all this, we also have the Body of Christ! Since Christ is such a Christ, we really need to praise. Because Christ is such a Christ, our praise really works!<p>Do you realize that the Christ of Psalm 8 is incarnated as a man? Without Hebrews 2, it would be difficult to discover the mentioning in Psalm 8 of Christ as a man. Hebrews 2 discloses that the man mentioned in Psalm 8 is Christ. God made Christ a little lower than the angels-this was the incarnation, and this was the man by the name of Jesus. After the incarnation, it says that this man was crowned with glory and honor. What is this? This is His ascension, including His resurrection. Christ was crowned with glory and honor because He was resurrected and ascended to the heavens. Therefore, the ascension here includes the resurrection. Then it says that all things were put under His feet. This is His dominion over all things. Now Christ has the dominion, the Lordship, the Headship, and the Kingdom. And just this little word &#8220;feet&#8221; indicates His Body. He has a Body. Ephesians 1:22 and 23 say that God &#8220;hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body.&#8221; The two feet are parts of the Body. Hence, we have the incarnation, the resurrection, the ascension, the enthronement, the Lordship, the Kingship, the Kingdom, and the Body of Christ. The Body is just the many saints who will be brought into glory according to Hebrews 2. The day will come when He will be the Head in God&#8217;s dominion, and we will be the Body under His Lordship and in His Kingdom to rule over the whole earth. In that day, we will all shout, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; Today we must have foresight to see through to the end. We must not care for today&#8217;s situation; we must set our eyes upon that day. Sooner or later that day will come. Sooner or later all these pitiful situations will be past. Praise the Lord!<p>Have you realized that in Psalms 3 through 7 there is a night prayer and a morning prayer? Psalm 3 is a prayer for the night, and Psalm 5 is a prayer for the morning. When I am going to sleep, I may pray Psalm 3, and when I arise in the morning, I may pray Psalm 5. But if we have really seen something of Psalms 2 and 8, we will have neither a night prayer nor a morning prayer; we will only have praise for Christ. We will say, &#8220;Look, there is a man in the glory! He was incarnated, He was made a little lower than the angels; He went to the cross and suffered death, He was resurrected and ascended to the heavens; He was enthroned and made the Head, the King, the Lord over all things. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!&#8221; Do you still have some evening prayers and some morning prayers? Are you so pious, so religious? Do you have a breakfast prayer, a lunch prayer and a dinner prayer? If you have seen Christ, you can only say, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; In the morning, in the evening, at the breakfast table, lunch table, dinner table, any kind of table, you will say, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; You will not have a marriage prayer, and you will not have a funeral prayer. In any kind of circumstance, you can only say, &#8220;I have seen Christ, I have seen God&#8217;s economy in Christ; I do not care for anything but Christ. O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&#8221;<p>Psalm 2 tells us that Christ is the center of God&#8217;s administration in the entire universe. Then Psalm 8 continues by telling us that this Christ is the incarnated and resurrected One, the One who has ascended to the heavens and is enthroned and crowned with glory and honor. He has the Lordship, the Headship, the Kingship, and the dominion over all things with His Body. He is a marvelous Christ! If we have seen this Christ, we can do nothing but praise Him.<p>In Psalms 3 through 7 the writers were occupied with the adversaries and their own problems; so they asked God to solve these problems. But the answer is in Psalm 8. It is by Christ incarnated, identified with man, crowned with glory, and made, with His Body, to have dominion over all things, that the problem on earth can be solved. The solution includes the incarnation up to the time of the Kingdom; then when the Kingdom comes, Christ with His Body will have dominion over all things. At that time all earth&#8217;s problems will be solved. This is the content of Psalm 8. Why is the name of the Lord so excellent in all the earth? Because Christ was incarnated to accomplish redemption, He was resurrected to impart life to His Body, He was crowned with glory, and He was enthroned and made to have dominion over all things with His Body. The day will come when Christ with His Body will exercise His authority. There is no need for you to ask for this and that; just wait praisingly. All the day praise for such a Christ!<p>During the past fifty years I have been closely observing world history. There have been world wars and other wars. The League of Nations has come and gone. The United Nations has been formed with the attempt to effect world peace. The human race has done its utmost to solve its problems, but the more problems they solve, the more they have. The fact is that no one can solve the problems. You just wait praisingly. Hallelujah, Christ will come back! He has been made the Head over all things to the church. With His Body He will have the dominion over all. At that time, everything will be solved. I am waiting for that. The older I get, the more I am expecting it and the closer I am to that time. Oh, let us all exclaim, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221;<p class=hbody>O Lord, our Lord, how excellent<br>Thy name in all the earth!<br>Let every people, tribe, and tongue<br>Proclaim its boundless worth.<br>Out of the mouth of little ones<br>Thou hast established praise,<br>That Thou may still Thine enemy<br>And swiftly end his days.</p><p class=hbody>When we the universe behold,<br>The work of Thy great hand-<br>The sun, the moon, and all the stars<br>By lofty wisdom planned;<br>O what is man that Thou should&#8217;st care,<br>That Thou should&#8217;st mindful be?<br>The son of man Thou visitest<br>In Thine economy.</p><p class=hbody>O Jesus Lord, Thou art that man,<br>The One who joined our race,<br>Who put upon Himself the flesh<br>And took a lower place.<br>But now with glory Thou art crowned,<br>With sovereignty complete.<br>Now through Thy Body Thou dost rule<br>With all beneath Thy feet.</p><p class=hbody>Thine incarnation, rising too,<br>And Thy transcendency,<br>Thy Lordship, Headship, Kingdom full,<br>And Body here we see.<br>By all these steps of work divine<br>Thou hast established praise.<br>With overflowing hearts to Thee<br>Our joyful voice we raise.</p><p class=hbody>Oh, soon that blessed day shall come-<br>All tongues these words shall peal!<br>But in the local churches now<br>We have a foretaste real.<br>O Lord, our Lord, how excellent<br>Thy name in all the earth!<br>Let every people, tribe, and tongue<br>Proclaim its boundless worth.</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #1097)</p><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST-THE ONE WITH GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 9 to 16</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 9:11, 14; 11:4; 14:7; 15:1; 16:1-11; Acts 2:25-28, 31</h1><p>Now let us consider the kind of Psalms that follow Psalm 8. They are of the same category as Psalms 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Again, it is pitiful.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN CONCEPT AND THE DIVINE</h2><p>We may sketch the spiritual level of the first fifteen Psalms as follows:<p>Do not laugh at the Psalmists; you are just like them. Last night you were in Psalm 8, but this morning you are in Psalm 15, or perhaps still in Psalm 12. This is exactly our situation; we are just like this. Last night it was &#8220;Hallelujah! O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; But when you left the meeting, by the time you got home, you had descended from the peak to the bottom of the valley. You immediately dropped from the top to the bottom, from Psalm 8 to Psalms 9 through 15.<p>We may define Psalms 9 to 15 by saying that the saints, based upon their concept of the law, judge that evil people are abhorred by God and that only the righteous can please God and abide with Him. This again is the concept of the law. Read all these Psalms 9 through 15. There are seven Psalms altogether in this group, and in essence all say the same thing: &#8220;O God, the wicked can never praise thee; they are abhorred by thee; only the righteous can please thee and abide with thee.&#8221; Meanwhile, while they were expressing something in this way, they still realized their need of the house of God. Why? Because God is universally invisible. If there is not a definite place in which God may dwell, it is difficult to locate Him. For this reason they appreciated the house of God. Psalm 9:11, 14, Psalm 11:4, Psalm 14:7, and Psalm 15:1 all prove that while the saints were expressing their concept of the law and asking God to judge the wicked, they realized their need of the house of God; they realized that God could be located in a solid place, in His dwelling. They praised God in the dwelling place of God, and they declared that God&#8217;s salvation issues from His dwelling. They realized their need of God&#8217;s house-but this is all.<p>If we do not have the heavenly vision, if we only have the human concept, we will say that every Psalm is wonderful. In a sense, every Psalm is wonderful. But when we have vision from above, we see that many of these so-called good Psalms are in the valley, at the bottom. I know that many of you, at least subconsciously, will not agree with me. You still say, &#8220;Psalm 9 is so good; Psalm 11 is wonderful.&#8221; I am afraid that some of you still have a great appreciation for Psalm 15. Something within you is still for these Psalms. It does not surprise me, for I was the same as you are. It is because we are short of heavenly vision. With heavenly vision, we see the true value and position of these Psalms.<p>But praise the Lord, we have another Psalm-Psalm 16! Now we must again apply the principle which we have previously mentioned: while the saints are uttering something according to their human concept, the Spirit of Christ intervenes at a certain point to express the divine concept within their expression.<p>Let us firstly read Psalm 15 to see the Psalmist&#8217;s expression according to his human concept: &#8220;Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.&#8221;<p>Is this good or not? Psalm 15:5 says, &#8220;He that doeth these things shall never be moved.&#8221; But Psalm 16:8 says, &#8220;I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.&#8221; Have you seen the difference? The difference is that in Psalm 15 you must do many righteous things; then you will not be moved. But Psalm 16 says that if you set the Lord before you, if He is at your right hand, you will not be moved. In Psalm 15:1 the Psalmist asks, &#8220;Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?&#8221; Who? According to Psalm 15 it is those who do all the things mentioned in that Psalm. But in Psalm 16:11 we read, &#8220;Thou wilt show me the path of life: thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.&#8221; Have you seen the difference? Now which of these two Psalms do you prefer? Where would you put Psalm 15? And where would you put Psalm 16?<h2 class=head1>PSALM 16-THE LIVING OF CHRIST</h2><p>When Peter was on the mount of transfiguration, he spoke nonsense, but when he spoke on the day of Pentecost, he was transparently clear. On the day of Pentecost, in Acts 2, he tells us that Psalm 16 is a prophecy of the resurrection of Christ. In Acts 2:25-28 Peter quoted Psalms 16:8-11, and then said that David, as a prophet, spake &#8220;of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.&#8221; Thus, by the word of Peter, we learn that Psalm 16 is a description of Christ. Psalm 2 is a Psalm of Christ, Psalm 8 is a Psalm of Christ, and Psalm 16 is another Psalm of Christ. Some Bible teachers call all these Psalms Messianic Psalms, but I prefer to say that they are Psalms of Christ.<p>The first Psalm of Christ is Psalm 2; it tells us something about Christ in principles. The whole earth with all its rulers is against Christ, but God has appointed Him. Regardless of what they do, God laughs at them, God will have them in derision. All history proves this. Then Christ proclaims that God has begotten Him by resurrection, and that God has given Him all the nations of this earth as His inheritance. And then we preach the gospel: Be wise, kings of the earth; be admonished, princes of this earth; you must kiss the Son, lest he be angry with you. All the points in Psalm 2 are concerning Christ in principle. Psalm 8 follows, telling us that Christ was incarnated, resurrected, ascended to the heavens, enthroned with glory, and made to have dominion over all things with His Body. By this all the problems on earth will be solved. It is wonderful and clear, but it is still not so clear. So we have the next Psalm of Christ, Psalm 16, which begins by telling us the kind of life Christ lived as a man on this earth. Psalm 8 told us that He was a man, a little lower than the angels, but it did not tell us the kind of life He lived. Hence, we need Psalm 16. This Psalm reveals to us that Christ, by humbling Himself to be a man and passing through death and resurrection, pleases God and abides with Him.<p>Let us consider this Psalm in more detail. The first section, verses 1 through 8, describe the human life of Christ on earth. These verses remove the veil to show us the living of this real man by the name of Jesus. &#8220;Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust&#8221; (v. 1). The life Jesus lived on this earth was a life of continual trust in God. His life was a trusting life. Then verse 2: &#8220;O my soul, thou hast said to the Lord, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.&#8221; This is the attitude of Jesus while He was on earth. Within Himself He said to God, &#8220;Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.&#8221; Verse 3: &#8220;To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent, thou has said, In them is all my delight.&#8221; He considered all the saints so excellent; His delight was in them. He trusted in God, and He loved all the saints. All these points are abundantly proved in the four Gospels. In verses 4 and 5 the Lord Jesus continues, &#8220;Their sorrows shall be multiplied that choose other gods: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, my cup: thou maintainest my lot.&#8221; This means that He had nothing to do with any idol. His interest was in God and with God-nothing else. Then verse 6: &#8220;The lines are fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.&#8221; He chose nothing for Himself; He left His destiny and all the choices to His Father. Verse 7: &#8220;I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.&#8221; How much He denied Himself! He trusted in the Father; He received the Father&#8217;s counsel. Then as a man He said, &#8220;I have set the Lord always before me because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved&#8221; (v. 8). We need to pray-read these eight verses and become intimately acquainted with the kind of life Christ lived while He was on earth as a man. This is the kind of life we need.<p>Then He was put to death; He was crucified. Apparently He was moved. But what did He say? &#8220;Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope&#8221; (v. 9). When did He say this? At the time He was dying, for He said, &#8220;My flesh (that means His body) shall rest in hope.&#8221; Read Peter&#8217;s words in Acts 2:24-32. He was put to death and laid in the grave, and while He was dying, He was glad, for He said, &#8220;My heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth.&#8221; What is His &#8220;glory&#8221;? &#8220;Glory&#8221; here means the innermost part of our being, the spirit. Consult some of the better translations of the Bible: they all interpret glory here as the innermost part, the spirit. Jesus was saved, His heart was glad, and His spirit, the innermost part of His being, rejoiced. Then why did Peter in Acts 2:26 translate &#8220;glory&#8221; as &#8220;tongue&#8221;? Because our spirit is the source of our praise, and our tongue is the means to express our praise. Whenever we praise the Lord, our praise must issue from our glory, our spirit, but it is always expressed by our tongue. In the matter of praising God, our tongue has very much to do with our spirit. Whenever we praise the Lord, we must praise Him out of our spirit and by our tongue. My heart is glad, my spirit rejoices, and my tongue praises. Then what about my body? My body will be buried, but while my body is buried, my flesh will rest in hope. In hope of what? In hope of resurrection. &#8220;For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption.&#8221; Peter tells us that this means resurrection.<p>Verse 11: &#8220;Thou wilt show me the path of life: thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.&#8221; If we have God&#8217;s presence, we have fulness of joy; if we are at His right hand, there are pleasures forevermore. After Christ was resurrected, He was seated at the right hand of God, where He enjoys pleasures forevermore.<p>Psalm 15 asks, &#8220;Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?&#8221; The real answer is in Psalm 16. Then what about Psalm 15? That answer is according to the human and religious concept. The answer according to the heavenly vision is the One revealed in Psalm 16. Such a One will abide in God&#8217;s dwelling place and dwell in His holy hill. He is there now; He is in the presence of God; He is at the right hand of God. Which one? The One who put His trust in God, the One who lived in the presence of God, the One who was put to death, who was resurrected by God, and who ascended to God&#8217;s right hand. This is the One who can dwell in the tabernacle of God.<p>We should all be able to recite Psalm 2, Psalm 8, and Psalm 16. No human words can exhaust the goodness of these Psalms. Oh, Psalm 2! Oh, Psalm 8! Oh, Psalm 16!<p class=hbody>The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,<br>The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.<br>His attitudes, choices, and interests all tell<br>The man who in God&#8217;s tabernacle may dwell.</p><p class=hbody>&#8220;Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide&#8221;-<br>In God He took refuge whate&#8217;er did betide.<br>&#8220;O Thou art my Lord, I&#8217;ve no good beyond Thee&#8221;-<br>He spoke in Himself unto God constantly.</p><p class=hbody>&#8220;As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,&#8221;<br>To Him they&#8217;re the people of excellent worth.<br>Of them He has said He has all His delight-<br>In proving this all the four Gospels unite.</p><p class=hbody>&#8220;Their sorrows are increased who other gods choose&#8221;-<br>All things of the idols did Jesus refuse.<br>He spoke not their names while upon earth He trod;<br>His interests were ever and only for God.</p><p class=hbody>&#8220;The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup&#8221;-<br>For everything He to the Father looked up.<br>&#8220;The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give&#8221;-<br>Himself He denied and by God&#8217;s word did live.</p><p class=hbody>His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,<br>And e&#8217;en in His death praise to God could be voiced;<br>His soul God would never abandon to hell,<br>But in resurrection His body would dwell.</p><p class=hbody>God raised Him, and He with God&#8217;s glory was crowned;<br>Then fulness of joy in God&#8217;s presence He found.<br>E&#8217;en now at the Father&#8217;s right hand is His seat,<br>Where flowing forever are pleasures complete.</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #1082)</p><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST CRUCIFIED</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 17 to 22:21</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 18:6, 22; 17:15; 18:43-44, 50; 20:6, 9; 21:3-5; 22:1-22</h1><p>After Psalm 8, we have Psalm 16 as a continuation of the Psalms about Christ. Then after Psalm 16, we have no more until Psalm 22. What about the Psalms between Psalm 16 and 22-Psalms 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21? By reading them carefully, we may realize that in these Psalms there is a certain kind of improvement. These Psalms are unlike Psalms 3 through 7 or 9 through 15. We may extend our little sketch to include these Psalms and to show the spiritual level and progression:<p>Psalms 17 through 21 are down from the level of Psalm 16, but they are not as far down as Psalm 3 through 7 and 9 through 15. Later, following Psalm 24, we will see more and more improvement, till finally, when we reach the last book of the Psalms, there will be no further declining. At the end of the Psalms, we have improvement to the uttermost, and the normal level is attained.<h2 class=head1>FROM THE LAW TO THE ANOINTED ONE</h2><p>Here, in Psalms 17 through 21, we have the first stage of improvement. We may define these Psalms as follows: The saints&#8217; prayers firstly take the righteousness of the law as a base, but later turn to God&#8217;s Anointed One, Christ, as the center. Do you see the improvement? The writers of these Psalms also appreciate the house of God. (See Psalm 18:6 and 20:2.) They realize that God hears their voices from His temple, that God sends them help from the sanctuary and strengthens them out of Zion. To this extent they appreciate God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>Psalm 19, as an insertion in this section, shows that the righteousness upon which the saints rely is of two kinds of testimony-the testimony of creation and the testimony of the law. But when we come to Psalms 20 and 21, God&#8217;s Anointed One becomes God&#8217;s testimony. The three great testimonies that God has toward man are creation, the law, and Christ. Christ is the last and greatest. For this reason there is the improvement. By this time the Psalmists came to realize something concerning Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed. They said that the king hears when they call (20:9). When they cry, God hears, and the king hears also. They put the king on the same level as God. This is a real improvement.<p>In Psalms 17 through 21 the concept changes from the law to God&#8217;s Anointed; it is gradually shifted from one line to another. Let us read all these verses referring to God&#8217;s Anointed.<p>Psalm 17:15, &#8220;As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.&#8221; This is apparently the word of David, but if we read it again and again, we will see that it is in reality the word of Christ. While David was uttering something, the Spirit of Christ spoke within his utterance. This is the utterance of the Anointed. &#8220;As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.&#8221; Many Bible students believe this expresses the desire of Christ during the three days between His crucifixion and resurrection. &#8220;When I awake (that means &#8220;when I arise&#8221;) I will be satisfied with thy likeness,&#8221; with the likeness of the Father. This was Christ&#8217;s desire while He was dead those three days. This is the desire of resurrection.<p>Now let us read Psalm 18:43-44: &#8220;Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the nations.&#8221; This, of course, does not refer to David; David was not the head of the nations, but Christ. These were the words of David, but within David&#8217;s words was the utterance of Christ. David was indeed God&#8217;s anointed king, but now Christ uttered something within David&#8217;s utterance. &#8220;A people whom I have not known shall serve me. As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.&#8221; This must be Christ. Now verse 50: &#8220;Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.&#8221; &#8220;Seed&#8221; here is singular, not plural. The seed is Christ. You see, the concept of the Psalms has been shifted from the law to the Anointed. This is indeed an improvement.<p>Now let us go on to Psalm 20, verses 6 and 9: &#8220;Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.&#8221; No doubt the king, the anointed, is Christ. &#8220;Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we call.&#8221; This is a wonderful verse. Who is the king? Christ is the King, the Anointed.<p>Psalm 21:3-5: &#8220;For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.&#8221; This verse is just like Revelation 1:18, which says, &#8220;I am living for evermore.&#8221; Verse 5: &#8220;His glory is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him.&#8221; Here we have one with glory, honor, majesty, and length of days. Who is this one? Undoubtedly, it is Christ. The concept of the Psalmist has totally changed; so, I say, there is an improvement. We could not see this kind of improvement in Psalms 3 through 7 or 9 through 15; it did not appear until after Psalm 16.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 22:1-21-CHRIST&#8217;S CRUCIFIXION</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 22. In order to understand this Psalm, we must realize that it is one of a group of three Psalms concerning Christ-Psalms 22, 23, and 24. What a tremendous improvement these three Psalms represent. They predict Christ in an excellent and orderly sequence: firstly His death, then His resurrection, then His shepherding after His resurrection, and eventually His coming back. Thus there are four items in these three Psalms: the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the shepherding of Christ, and the return of Christ as the King. It is marvelous!<p>Furthermore, in order to understand these three Psalms, we must keep in mind all the preceding Psalms concerning Christ-Psalms 2, 8, and 16. We have seen that Psalm 2 presents a summary concerning Christ in principle. Then Psalm 8 adds something more-His incarnation, ascension and enthronement. Next, Psalm 16 reveals His life on this earth, how He died and was resurrected, and how He was installed at the right hand of God with pleasures forevermore. How good it is! But still the account is not so complete and clear. It is given bit by bit, something here and something there; something added, and then something more added. We have Psalm 2, Psalm 8, and then Psalm 16. Now we have Psalms 22, 23, and 24.<p>I especially encourage all the young ones to memorize all these Psalms concerning Christ, not only Psalms 2, 8, and 16, but also Psalms 22, 23, and 24. The older ones can memorize at least the main points of these Psalms. This will not put you to death; there is resurrection life within these Psalms.<p>Psalm 22 is divided into two sections: verses 1 through 21 compose the first section, while verse 22 to the end of the Psalm is the second. The first part speaks of the crucifixion of Christ, and the second section of His resurrection. It is so clear.<p>In the entire Bible, not another passage relates the crucifixion of Christ in so much detail as the first section of Psalm 22. The Psalm begins, &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; In Matthew 27:46 we hear Christ speaking these words. These are not only the opening words of this Psalm, but also the first words of Christ on the cross. Christ spoke seven sentences from the cross, and this one is the first.<p>Verse 6 says, &#8220;But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.&#8221; This was fully fulfilled when Christ was put upon the cross. It was there that people despised Him; it was there that He became a reproach to all the people. Now verse 7: &#8220;All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head.&#8221; In Matthew 27 and Mark 15 we see the same thing; the fulfillment is there. Then verse 8: &#8220;He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.&#8221; This is exactly what took place at the cross. The chief priests mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, &#8220;He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him&#8221; (Matt. 27:43).<p>Verse 12: &#8220;Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.&#8221; So many leaders were there around the cross, just like the strong bulls. Verse 13: &#8220;They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.&#8221; In verse 14 we see a vivid picture of the crucifixion. At that time Christ cried, &#8220;I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint.&#8221; While He was on the cross, the very weight of His body caused all His bones to be out of joint. &#8220;My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.&#8221; This is why He said, &#8220;I thirst&#8221; (John 19:28). Verse 15: &#8220;My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.&#8221; He was burnt, He was consumed by the holy fire of God on the cross. Verse 16: &#8220;For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.&#8221; This was exactly enacted on the cross. Now verses 17 and 18: &#8220;I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.&#8221; Matthew 27, Mark 15, and John 19 record the fulfillment of all these things. Finally, verses 20 and 21: &#8220;Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion&#8217;s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.&#8221; Undoubtedly this was the cry of Christ unto the Father; and this cry was answered. We will see the answer in the next chapter: He was resurrected; He was delivered out of death.<p>Now you may see how Psalms 2, 8, 16 and 22 unfold little by little the Christ of God. There is no other book in the Old Testament which presents the things of Christ in so much detail as the Psalms. When we have completed the entire book, you will have a full picture of Christ, a picture which is even more clear and complete than the New Testament.<p>Oh, how much we need to see Christ in the Psalms! This is just the beginning; later, after the first book, we will see the preciousness, the sweetness, and the enjoyment of the house of God through the real experiences of Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST RESURRECTED,  THE SHEPHERD, AND THE COMING KING</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 22:22 to Psalm 24</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 22:22-31; 23-24</h1><h2 class=head1>PSALM 22:22-31-CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>As we have seen, the first part of Psalm 22 depicts the death of Christ. Now the last part of this Psalm speaks of the resurrection of Christ in a marvelous way. The word &#8220;resurrection&#8221; is not used in the passage, but the fact of resurrection is indicated clearly and definitely.<p>Verse 22 says, &#8220;I will declare thy name unto my brethren.&#8221; This indicates a sudden change in the trend of this Psalm. The situation in the previous verses is full of intense suffering and sadness. Then suddenly He says, &#8220;I will declare thy name.&#8221; This means that He was resurrected. After His resurrection, He said, &#8220;I will declare thy name (the name of the Father) unto my brethren.&#8221; This verse is quoted in Hebrews 2:12, by which we see that it is a prophecy of Christ.<p>The Lord Jesus, after His resurrection, told Mary, &#8220;Go to my brethren&#8221; (John 20:17). Then, again, in Matthew 28:10, He said, &#8220;Go tell my brethren.&#8221; Before His death, the Lord Jesus never called the disciples His brethren. Why? Because by His resurrection all His disciples were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) and made the sons of God; thus, they all became His brethren. The New Testament tells us that on one hand the Lord Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16), but on the other hand that He is the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). Before His resurrection, the Lord Jesus was the only begotten Son; but after His resurrection, the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son, for at that time all His believers were regenerated and became His brethren, the sons of God. The only begotten Son became the firstborn Son, the firstborn of many brethren. &#8220;That he might be the firstborn among many brethren.&#8221; This is not a small matter.<p>Here we have a hint of the church: &#8220;I will declare thy name unto my brethren.&#8221; All His brethren are the members of His Body, the church.<p>Then Psalm 22:22 continues, &#8220;In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.&#8221; This is the Old Testament rendering. In the quotation of this verse in Hebrews, the word &#8220;congregation&#8221; is rendered differently to read &#8220;church.&#8221; &#8220;In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee&#8221; (2:12). Here we have the church, and we are the church. We all must believe that Christ today as the resurrected Lord is among us, and that He is singing among us. When we sing, He sings within our singing. Christ is in resurrection, and He has many brethren to be His church, His Body. Now He is in the church, singing praise to the Father, and He asks us to praise the Father: &#8220;Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him&#8221; (v. 23).<p>From verse 26 to the end of this Psalm there are some things which are difficult for many to understand. But if you pray-read this section again and again, looking unto the Spirit, you will see that it describes the result of His death and resurrection. The result is fivefold: firstly, the meek and the prosperous shall &#8220;eat and be satisfied&#8221; (vv. 26, 29). It is so good. We are the eating people. Day by day we are eating in His resurrection; so we are satisfied. Then, because we are satisfied, we worship. The worldly people and even some Christians do not understand what we are doing. We are the meek ones, and they are the proud ones; we are the truly prosperous ones, but they are the miserable ones. The meek and the prosperous ones of this earth shall eat, be satisfied, and worship.<p>The second aspect is in verse 27: &#8220;All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord.&#8221; This is really so. All the ends of the earth, especially today, do remember the Lord, turn to Him, and worship Him.<p>The third aspect is seen in verse 29: &#8220;All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and he that cannot keep alive his own soul.&#8221; This corresponds with Philippians 2, where we read that all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth shall bow before Christ. Praise the Lord, we are the living ones, but the Bible tells us that even the dead shall bow before Him. At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, because Christ was resurrected.<p>The fourth aspect of the result of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is in verse 28: &#8220;For the kingdom is the Lord&#8217;s: and he rules over the nations.&#8221; Christ is the King ruling over the nations. We have not seen this with our eyes; but one day we will see it. It seems that Satan is ruling today, but with heavenly revelation we can see through to the reality. Christ is the King. The Kingdom is the Lord&#8217;s, and He rules over the nations. Do you believe the present situation, or do you believe the Word of God? Praise the Lord, we do believe the Word of God.<p>The fifth point concerns the Gospel preaching: &#8220;A seed shall serve him; it shall be told concerning the Lord to the coming generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this&#8221; (vv. 30-31). No doubt this refers to the believers; the believers are the seed of Christ. We shall tell the coming generation; we shall declare His righteousness, justification, salvation, to a people yet to be born; and we will tell them that the Lord has done this. This is the Gospel preaching. The five aspects of the result of the death and resurrection of Christ are these. We cannot at this time go into these matters thoroughly; I have simply indicated the lines with all the points to you. I trust in you and I trust in the Holy Spirit that you will take time to pray-read these verses to gain something more.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 23-CHRIST IN HIS SHEPHERDING</h2><p>After Psalm 22, Christ is in resurrection. Praise the Lord! But we have here not only one Psalm of Christ, but three Psalms of Christ. Thus, after Psalm 22, we have Psalm 23.<p>Most Christians do not realize that Psalm 23 is a continuation of Psalm 22. &#8220;The Lord is my shepherd.&#8221; Who is this Lord who is my shepherd? Christ in resurrection is my Shepherd. We should not forget the previous Psalm, which tells how He suffered death to accomplish redemption for us, how He was resurrected, and how we were made His brethren by His resurrection. It is also by this that the whole earth, in a sense, turns to Him, even the dead bow before Him, and we, the meek and prosperous ones, are all the day eating Him, being satisfied with Him, worshipping Him, serving Him, and preaching the Gospel to the coming generation. Such a Christ, who has died, was resurrected, and brought forth such a result, is our Shepherd.<p>The New Testament also speaks about Christ as our Shepherd. The Lord calls Himself &#8220;the good shepherd&#8221; (John 10:11), and He is also called the &#8220;great shepherd&#8221; (Heb. 13:20). God has raised Him from the dead to be the great Shepherd of the sheep. In 1 Peter 5:4, Peter tells us that He is the &#8220;chief shepherd,&#8221; the head of all the shepherds. He is the Shepherd in resurrection. He is the Shepherd today not in the heavens, but here on the earth within us and among us. So He must be the resurrected One, He must be the leading One, and He must be the Spirit. If He were not, how could He be among us and in us on this earth as our Shepherd? Therefore, it is in resurrection that Christ today is the Shepherd as revealed in this Psalm.<p>We cannot say much now concerning Psalm 23, but I wish to indicate that within His shepherding there are five stations through which we must pass. The first station is so wonderful-the green pastures with the still waters. &#8220;He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters&#8221; (v. 2). So many of you in the local churches are lying on the green pastures and drinking of the still waters. So many newcomers in these days are shouting, &#8220;Hallelujah, now we are in the local church!&#8221; I agree with you, and I am happy, so very happy. Christ in the local church is the green pastures, and in the local church we are beside the still waters. But this is just the first station, the beginning of His shepherding.<p>The second station is the paths of righteousness. &#8220;He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name&#8217;s sake&#8221; (v. 3). It is not sufficient for us merely to enjoy Him; the purpose of the enjoyment is that we may go on and walk in the paths of righteousness. We need to walk not only in the path of grace, but also in the path of righteousness. We all know what righteousness is. With grace there is love and happiness, and everything is rather easy. But with the matter of righteousness, it is not so easy; there is a certain kind of regulation and restriction. We must go on from the green pastures to take the paths of righteousness for His name&#8217;s sake. This is the second station.<p>Then we must proceed to the third. We must go on and on. We who have been following Him for years can tell you that the further we go, the more difficult the situation becomes. The third station is the valley of the shadow of death. I know that you like the green pastures; you do not like the valley of the shadow of death. The valley is not at the top, but at the bottom; it is not the shining, but the shadow; it is not the life, but the death. You would like to stay in the green pastures with the still waters, but sooner or later you will enter the valley. Regardless of how much we help you to stay on top, you will descend to the valley. You will pass through the valley of the shadow of death. I know you will. But do not be frightened; listen to what the Psalmist says: &#8220;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me&#8221; (v. 4). If you have ever observed a shepherd with his flock in various situations, you know that when the flock is lying in the green pastures, the shepherd may leave for a while or remain at a distance. But when the flock is passing through the valley with its shadows, he is so near and protective. When you are passing through the valley of the shadow of death, the Shepherd is nearer to you than ever before.<p>Moreover, His rod and His staff comfort you. The rod is for protection, to keep the wolves away, and the staff is for guidance in whatever way your need demands. In the valley you have the Shepherd with you; you have His rod, and you have His staff. It is sufficient. In all the past years I have passed through a good number of valleys. But whenever I have entered a valley, the presence of the Lord has been so dear and so precious. I can testify that the rod has protected me and the staff has guided me. It is really so. This is the third station.<p>After the valley, you may think that everything should be so wonderful. But the next station is the battlefield. It is after the valley of the shadow of death that you are qualified and equipped for fighting. Allow me to say that however living and active you are now, I can have no trust in you. You need to pass the test; you need to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. The potters, after making certain objects of clay, place them in an oven to be burnt. There is a great difference between vessels of clay which have been burnt and those which have not. The valley of the shadow of death is the place for us to be burnt. After this experience we are qualified and equipped to fight the battle.<p>But on the battlefield, praise the Lord, there is a table set before us. &#8220;Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies&#8221; (v. 5). The fighting on the battlefield is the feasting. While we are fighting, we are feasting. We may tell the enemy, &#8220;Send your armies; all your armies will be the courses of our feast.&#8221; The Old Testament tells us that even the enemies are our food (Num. 14:9). For us Christians, the enemies are the best food. This is a table, a table spread with many courses. And this is not all. It is here on the battlefield that we experience the anointing of our head with oil and our cup running over. It is really so. In our experiences, the more we are on the battlefield fighting for the Lord, the more we sense that we are under the anointing, that we are feasting and our cup is running over. It is really good. But still this is not all.<p>Now we come to the last station. Hallelujah! &#8220;Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever&#8221; (v. 6). What is this? It is at this point that we are settled in the local church. The Psalmist did not say that he would pass through the house of the Lord, but that he would dwell in the house of the Lord. Some Christians conceive of this as going one day to heaven. After passing through all the courses on earth, they think, they will die and go to heaven, where they will dwell in the house of the Lord. Do you believe that this scripture means that? If you could go to David, the author of this Psalm, he would tell you that this is absolute nonsense. David expected to dwell in the house of the Lord on this earth.<p>You may say that now you are in the local church. Yes, you are in the local church, but let me illustrate the real situation to you from my experience. I have been in the local church for forty years, but I can testify that my being in the local church today is different from my being there forty years ago. Forty years ago I was not so deeply settled in the local church, but today I am deeply settled. Not one who is reading this book can remove me from the local church. I am dwelling in the house of the Lord. I can hear some of you saying, &#8220;Hallelujah, I am so happy I am in the local church!&#8221; But after six months you may say, &#8220;It is not so good as it used to be; I&#8217;m not so happy.&#8221; Eventually you may even say, &#8220;This local church is not what I thought it was; I&#8217;m going to give it up.&#8221; An infant tree which has been planted only two weeks ago is easily plucked up. But after a tree has been growing for forty years, a giant bulldozer would be required to remove it. Praise the Lord, I am really settled in the house of the Lord. I do not care whether the house of the Lord seems to be wonderful or miserable-I am just here. You may think today that you are settled in the house of the Lord, but you are not so settled. You need time to pass the test, time to grow, time to let your roots be deeply implanted. The shepherding of the resurrected Christ is to lead us into the local churches, to lead us into the house of the Lord forever. It is here that goodness and lovingkindness follow us all the days of our life.<p>This is the last station. We start with the green pastures, and we end with the house of the Lord; in between we have the paths of righteousness, the valley of the shadow of death, and the battlefield. This is Psalm 23; it shows us how the resurrected Christ shepherds us, leading us into the house of God. It is really good! But this is not all.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 24-CHRIST IN HIS COMING BACK</h2><p>Psalm 24 is one of the deepest of all the Psalms, and it is rather difficult to understand. It opens by saying, &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s.&#8221; Psalm 8 speaks of the excellence of the Lord&#8217;s name in all the earth. But this Psalm goes beyond that: &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the fulness thereof; the habitable earth, and they that dwell therein.&#8221; This means that the Lord has the right, the title, to this earth. &#8220;For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the ocean currents.&#8221; He has established it, so it is His. Apparently, the earth today is not the Lord&#8217;s. Even when this Psalm was written the earth was apparently not the Lord&#8217;s. But have you realized that on this earth there was at least a hill, which was called the hill of His holiness, and at least that hill was His? Thus, verse 3 says, &#8220;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?&#8221; The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, but actually today the earth is not the Lord&#8217;s. Yet on this earth there is at least a hill, at least a spot, which is the Lord&#8217;s.<p>Let me illustrate. Is Los Angeles today the Lord&#8217;s? No. But do you realize that today in Los Angeles there is a hill? Praise the Lord! In typology, Zion at that time was the hill. The hill of Zion was one hundred percent possessed by the Lord, though the entire earth was not. We may express it this way: the earth is the Lord&#8217;s, yet only the hill of Zion was actually possessed by the Lord. Likewise, Los Angeles is the Lord&#8217;s, but only the hill of the local church is possessed today by the Lord. Is California the Lord&#8217;s? No. But in California there are some hills, there are some local churches, and these places are possessed by the Lord.<p>Verse 3 asks, &#8220;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?&#8221; The answer is, Christ and His brethren. The church is a hill which is occupied by the Lord today as the very stepping-stone, the beachhead, for the Lord to come back. The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, but today the earth is usurped; yet in this usurped earth there is a spot, a hill, which is the stepping-stone for the Lord to return to take the whole earth.<p>Verse 7: &#8220;Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye ancient doors; and the King of glory shall come in.&#8221; As the hill of Zion we must have our doors open that Christ may come. According to an article which I believe to be accurate, this Psalm was written at the occasion of David&#8217;s returning the ark to Zion. It was in that kind of situation, with that kind of background, that David wrote Psalm 24. Zion was there, and the gates and doors were there. Then David said, &#8220;Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye ancient doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.&#8221; This is Christ. The ark was the type of Christ. The ark coming in typified Christ coming in.<p>In Revelation 3:20 the Lord said to the church in Laodicea, &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.&#8221; This verse indicates that even some of the local churches shut the Lord Jesus outside. Do not imagine that as long as we are the local church, the Lord Jesus is among us. In a sense He is, but in another sense He may be shut out. Even today, while we are enjoying the Lord&#8217;s presence so much, we still must say, &#8220;Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye ancient doors.&#8221; We all must be so open to the Lord. If Christ could not come in to the church today in an adequate and fuller way, how could Christ come back to the earth? If the church, if Zion, is not absolutely open to Him, how can we expect the earth to be open to Him? So today we must respond and say, &#8220;Yes, open the doors, let us all open widely to Him. Come in, O come in, Lord! Before You come back to the earth, come in to the church, come in to fully possess this little hill, the hill of Zion.&#8221;<p>In the background of Psalm 24, the hill of Zion was there, but the ark was missing. Now the ark is coming in; Christ is coming in. And while the ark was entering, David said, &#8220;Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye ancient doors; and the King of glory shall come in.&#8221; We may be the hill of Zion, we may be the local church, but the King of glory is not so absolutely within. We need to be open, we need to be lifted up, to let the King of glory come in all the way. Then the church will be the stepping-stone, the beachhead, for the Lord to return and possess the earth.<p>In the latter part of King David&#8217;s life, he was chased out of Jerusalem by his rebellious son, Absalom. His kingdom was threatened; his place was usurped. But the Lord vindicated David, and after a short time Absalom perished. During that time David sent some to Jerusalem to prepare the way for his return. They became the stepping-stone for King David to come back (2 Sam. 15:25-29; 19:11-15). Today we are the ones sent by Christ into this rebellious, usurped world. We are here as the stepping-stone for His return to regain the earth. In this usurped world there is a hill as the very beachhead which the Lord must possess. If He can fully possess this area, He can return to take over the whole earth. This is the thought, the deep thought, of Psalm 24. Praise the Lord!<h2 class=head1>SUMMARY</h2><p>Now let us put all these three Psalms together. Psalm 22 tells us that Christ was put to death; He was crucified for our sake. &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; We all must answer, &#8220;Lord, because of me, for my sake!&#8221; He suffered death to accomplish redemption for us. Then He was resurrected, and by His resurrection He brought so many brethren into being. These brethren became His flock, His church, His Body; and now He is shepherding this flock, He is caring for the church, He is building up His Body. For what purpose? That He may have a spot on this earth, a hill in this usurped earth, as a stepping-stone for Him to come back to regain the entire earth. At that time He will be the returning King. In Psalm 22 He is the Redeemer and Regenerator. In Psalm 23 He is the Shepherd; and in Psalm 24 He is the coming King, the King who will regain the entire earth through the people He is shepherding today. He died for us, and He was resurrected with us and made us His brethren that we may be His flock under His shepherding, that we may be His church under His building. Then through us, by us and with us, He will come back to be the King of glory. Could we have all this in the New Testament? We need the Psalms.<p>We may say that Psalms 22 through 24 tell us how Christ makes the saints to partake of Him. He does it by five steps: (1) By accomplishing redemption for them through His suffering death (Psa. 22:1-21); (2) By making them His brethren through His resurrection (Psa. 22:22-26); (3) By being preached to the uttermost part of the earth that all the people may turn to Him, worship Him, and serve Him (Psa. 22:27-31); (4) By being their Shepherd in the resurrection life, leading them to dwell in the house of God (Psa. 23); (5) By coming back to the earth to be the King of glory for them (Psa. 24). It is wonderful!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST BRINGING US TO THE HOUSE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 25 to 41</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 40:6-8; 34:8; 26:8; 27:4-6; 28:2; 29:9b; 36:7-9; 31:21</h1><p>We have covered six Psalms of Christ-Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23 and 24.<h2 class=head1>GOD WILL RECOVER THE EARTH</h2><p>Notice that the word &#8220;earth&#8221; is a key word in almost all of these six Psalms. Psalm 2:8 says, &#8220;Ask of me, and I shall give thee...the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.&#8221; The nations will be an inheritance to Christ, and the earth, including the uttermost parts, will be Christ&#8217;s possession. Then in Psalm 8 we have the exclamation, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think any of us could ever forget the word &#8220;earth&#8221; in Psalm 8. People today are intensely interested in the things of the heavens, but God is more interested in the earth. How excellent is His name in all the earth. Psalm 16:3 tells us of the excellent in the earth. We also have the words &#8220;lot&#8221; and &#8220;heritage&#8221; in this Psalm. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage&#8221; (vv. 5-6). The lot and the heritage of the Lord Jesus are the earth! Then in Psalm 22 we have more concerning the earth: &#8220;All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord&#8221; (v. 27). There is no mention of the earth in Psalm 23, but it is set forth in Psalm 24: &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the fulness thereof; the habitable earth, and they that dwell therein&#8221; (v. 1).<p>God&#8217;s intention is to recover the earth for His Christ. The earth is the Lord&#8217;s. In Psalm 8, the Psalmist was gazing upon the heavens. He said, &#8220;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.&#8221; Yet his praise was, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221; He considered the heavens, but his praise concerned the earth.<p>The Lord will recover the earth, the earth which is now usurped by the enemy. The secret is in Psalm 24. The earth is the Lord&#8217;s; so the Lord has the right, the title, to the earth. He realizes this right by the &#8220;hill.&#8221; The hill is the key, the stepping-stone, for the Lord&#8217;s recovery of the earth. Upon this hill is the house, and the house is built up with the brethren. The brethren were brought forth by the resurrection of Christ, and the resurrection issued from His crucifixion. Before His crucifixion, there was His wonderful life on this earth, a life which issued from His incarnation. Thus we have all these major steps leading up to God&#8217;s recovery of the earth: His incarnation in Psalm 8, His human living in Psalm 16, His crucifixion and resurrection in Psalm 22 (His resurrection is also mentioned or implied in Psalms 2, 8, and 16), His brethren in Psalm 22, His house in Psalm 23, and eventually the hill on the earth in Psalm 24. Keep in mind all these key words in these six Psalms about Christ. If we did not have the Psalms, but only the New Testament, how could we gain such an apprehension of Christ? We need the Psalms, but we also need heavenly vision to read the Psalms; otherwise we only receive a certain kind of inspiration. We must see in all these Psalms the precious stones, the gems, the vital points. It is not sufficient to receive merely a good feeling and vague inspiration.<h2 class=head1>FROM THE LAW TO CHRIST AND THE HOUSE</h2><p>Now we must go on. The main point of the first book, Psalms 1-41, is that God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God. I believe that by now we have all turned to Christ. We have covered twenty-four Psalms already; now in this chapter we will cover the remaining seventeen Psalms of the first book. Let us look specifically at Psalms 25 to 41. The main purpose here is to show how the saints experience and enjoy God through Christ, especially in the house and the city of God.<p>The subject of the first Psalm is the law. But immediately in the second Psalm, the subject is changed from the law to Christ. Hallelujah! Beginning with Psalm 2 we have seen six Psalms of Christ, ending with Psalm 24. But however much we appreciate the preciousness of Christ, we must realize that Christ is not the consummation. Christ is for the house; Christ is for the church. In Matthew 16, when Peter saw Christ by the Father&#8217;s revelation, the Lord immediately directed his attention to the church: &#8220;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church&#8221; (v. 18). Here in the Psalms we firstly have the law, according to the human, natural, religious concept of the saints. But God turned the saints to Christ. Then we have Christ revealed, portrayed, and detailed in Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23 and 24. We must repeat again and again these Psalms about the preciousness of Christ. But in this section, from Psalm 2 to Psalm 24, we have very little mentioned of the house. Indeed, the house is mentioned in these Psalms (see 5:7, 11:4, and 18:6), but it is not emphasized. These few references to the house speak only of such matters as coming into His house, praising God in His temple, and prayer being heard in the temple. But following Psalm 24, from Psalms 25 to 41, the house is set forth in a richer way. In all these seventeen Psalms, Christ is not often mentioned, but the house is repeatedly emphasized. The main thing in this section is the house. There is reference after reference to the house. Oh, the house, the house, for the enjoyment of God! It is in this section that the wonderful verse is found, &#8220;O taste and see that the Lord is good&#8221; (34:8). But where may we taste Him? In the house! We can only taste God in His house.<p>In Psalm 1 the law is everything. But immediately the Spirit changes the subject to Christ. Then, from Psalms 2 to 24, Christ is richly and strongly presented. Yet, even in these Psalms, the law is still not absolutely abandoned. But when we come to Psalms 25 to 41, it is rather difficult to find a single verse concerning the law. I cannot find one. The law is in Psalm 1, but in Psalms 2 to 24 Christ becomes the main figure, and the law is on its way out. Then, in Psalms 25 to 41, the law is over, and the house of God becomes the main figure. We have turned from the law to Christ, and Christ has brought us to the house. Oh, the house! Hallelujah for God&#8217;s house!<p>Psalms 25 to 41 show us how the saints experience and enjoy God through Christ, especially in the house and the city of God. In these Psalms the sufferings of the saints are identical to the sufferings of Christ. There are a number of verses which indicate the various aspects of Christ&#8217;s suffering and His attitude in suffering. His life was spent with grief; He was a reproach among the people; He was slandered and threatened; and the people took counsel together against Him and devised to take away His life (Psa. 31:10-13, cf. Isa. 53:3; John 7:44; 8:59; 11:56-57; Matt. 26:3-4). The wicked watched Him and sought to slay Him (Psa. 37:32, cf. Luke 11:54). He trusted in God (Psa. 31:14, cf. Heb. 2:13). His times were in God&#8217;s hand (Psa. 31:15, cf. John 7:6-8). He committed His spirit into God&#8217;s hand (Psa. 31:5, cf. Luke 23:46). All these verses in the Psalms are the words of the suffering saints, but their sufferings were identical to the sufferings of Christ.<p>In these Psalms there are also several prophecies concerning Christ. He considered Himself as a sacrifice and an offering to God, and He delighted to do the will of God (Psa. 40:6-8, cf. Heb. 10:5-8). The people hated Him without a cause (Psa. 35:19, cf. John 15:25). One of His disciples betrayed Him (Psa. 41:9, cf. John 13:18). Not one of His bones were broken (Psa. 34:20, cf. John 19:36). All these are prophecies of His suffering.<p>These Psalms also indicate how, through Christ, the saints experience and enjoy God as their light, their salvation, their strength, and their shield (Psa. 27:1; 28:7), and they taste God Himself (Psa. 34:8).<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT IN THE HOUSE</h2><p>Now let us come to the most strategic point, the house and the city, and see how the saints experience and enjoy God there. Firstly, they love God&#8217;s house as the habitation where God&#8217;s glory dwells: &#8220;Lord, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth&#8221; (Psa. 26:8). Secondly, they desire to dwell in the house of God to behold His beauty, inquire in His temple, be hidden and protected in it, offer sacrifices of joy, and sing praises to Him: &#8220;One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of shouts of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord&#8221; (Psa. 27:4-6). This is a prediction of the church life. We all must desire to dwell in the local churches to behold God&#8217;s beauty. We should offer sacrifices of shouts of joy (J. N. Darby&#8217;s translation). I believe that today the Brethren would never agree with our shoutings; but one of their leaders, J. N. Darby, rendered this translation of Psalm 27:6. They do have the translation, but they do not have the reality.<p>Some Christians condemn this kind of shouting and even dare to claim that it is of the devil. How can Christians be so bold and presumptuous to make such accusations? What then shall we do with Psalm 27:6? &#8220;I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of shouts of joy!&#8221; Do you think that shouting in the meetings is going too far? According to the religious concept shouting is considered an extreme practice because Christianity has been utilized by the enemy to silence Christians and produce dumb worshippers. But we have been released! Praise the Lord, we must shout for joy forever! Where? In the local churches, in the house of God.<p>I was taught long ago that we must desire one thing of the Lord, to dwell in the house of the Lord (Psa. 27:4). But in these last few years I have seen that verse 6 of Psalm 27 is a continuation of verse 4. Not only must we dwell in the house of the Lord, but we must also offer sacrifices of shouts of joy in the house. When I was young, I was told by some Christian teachers that it is not proper to shout in a church meeting place, but that alone on the mountains it may be permissible. But here the Psalmist says, &#8220;I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of shouts of joy.&#8221; The Psalmist would shout not only on the mountain, but in the tabernacle of God. You see, we do have scriptural ground for shouting in the church meetings.<p>It is rather difficult to find a verse in the Bible telling us that we must study the Word in the house of God, give a message in the house of God, or listen to a good speaker in the house of God. It is also difficult to find a verse in the Psalms telling us to wait in silence in the house of God. But we have Psalm 27 showing us that the house of God is not only a place to behold His beauty and inquire of Him, but also a place to shout. And this shouting is a kind of sacrifice.<p>The house is also the place to sing praises unto the Lord. We do need an abundance of singing in God&#8217;s house. We may need a few messages and a little listening, but how much more we need the singing of praises! All these things are in the house. I just love the house! I do not know how much you love the local churches. Sometimes my family says that I may not be so happy at home, but when I am in the church, I am a different person!<p>In the house of God the saints also lift up their hands toward the inmost place of God&#8217;s sanctuary: &#8220;Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the inmost place of thy sanctuary&#8221; (Psa. 28:2). Some say that lifting up one&#8217;s hands in the meeting is too extreme. But here not only one hand is lifted, but both hands are lifted. You may say that this is merely an Old Testament practice, but Paul says, &#8220;I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:8). You see how wrong today&#8217;s Christianity is! They have dropped all these practices and condemn others for them. We, by the Lord&#8217;s mercy, must recover them. We must not care for their condemnation, but only for the Lord. When we say, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; we are released; and when we say, &#8220;Amen, Hallelujah,&#8221; we are more released. We just care for the release of our spirit; we do not care who will criticize and condemn.<p>In God&#8217;s house the saints speak of God&#8217;s glory: &#8220;In his temple doth every one speak of his glory&#8221; (Psa. 29:9). Everyone speaks. This corresponds with 1 Corinthians 14:31, &#8220;Ye can all prophesy one by one.&#8221; What is it to prophesy? It is just to speak the glory of God. Everyone can speak the glory of God in His house, and everyone in the local churches must speak.<p>In God&#8217;s house the saints are under the shadow of God&#8217;s wings, enjoying His precious lovingkindness: &#8220;How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God!&#8221; (Psa. 36:7). In God&#8217;s house they are satisfied with the fatness of His house: &#8220;They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house&#8221; (36:8). In the local churches we do have fatness. In God&#8217;s house the saints are drinking of the river of God&#8217;s pleasure: &#8220;Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures&#8221; (36:8). In the local churches we are really drinking of divine pleasures. In God&#8217;s house the saints partake of the fountain of life: &#8220;For with thee is the fountain of life&#8221; (36:9). And in God&#8217;s house the saints see light in God&#8217;s light: &#8220;In thy light shall we see light&#8221; (36:9). Here we have the river of pleasures and the fountain of life; and here, where life is, there is always light, for the life is the light of men. All this is in the local churches.<p>Two verses in Psalms 23 and 24 introduce the house of God. One verse speaks of dwelling in the house of the Lord forever, and the other mentions the hill of the Lord, which is the site of the house. Then in Psalms 25 to 41 the central and predominant figure is the house. &#8220;I have loved the habitation of thy house&#8221; (Psa. 26:8). &#8220;One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple&#8221; (Psa. 27:4). &#8220;They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house&#8221; (Psa. 36:8). Have you seen the improvement in the realization and enjoyment of the house of God? When we reach Psalm 36, we reach the peak concerning the house. The climax is here. In Psalms 22, 23, and 24, concerning Christ, we have come to the peak in the Psalms of Christ. Then through Christ and with Christ we enter into the house of God. His shepherding brings us into His house. Here in the house of God we have the sweet enjoyment of the riches of God. This is Book I in the Psalms. It begins with the law; then from the law it turns to Christ; and from Christ it hits the house.<p>I love this portion of the Psalms, with its emphasis mainly on the house of the Lord. And within this portion there is at least one verse indicating something more-the city (31:21). &#8220;Blessed be the Lord: for he hath shewed me his marvelous lovingkindness in a strong city.&#8221; The saints realize God&#8217;s marvelous lovingkindness in His strong city. Hence, in Book I, we have moved from the law to Christ, from Christ to the house, and from the house to the city. The law has been silenced and the saints have turned to Christ; Christ is then intensified with the house and fortified with the city, a strong city. In the Psalms we see not only Christ, but also the church as the house and city of God. Hallelujah!<p>In Book I of the Psalms there is only one verse concerning the city, and that just in a simple and brief way. When we come to Book II, we will see many things concerning the city. Then, when we reach Psalm 122 in the last part of the Psalms, the city reaches its consummation-&#8220;O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem!&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST BECOMING MORE PRECIOUS IN THE HOUSE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 42 to 45</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 42:1, 4; 43:3-4; 45:1-17</h1><h2 class=head1>BOOK II-PSALMS 42 TO 72</h2><p>Now we come to Book II, composed of Psalms 42 to 72. As this book indicates how the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ, so it begins with the words: &#8220;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God&#8221; (42:1). The saints, being stripped by God, desire to seek God Himself. Then the Psalmist goes on, &#8220;My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God&#8221;-not for the law, not for knowledge, but for the living God Himself. The Psalmist continues by asking, &#8220;When shall I come and appear before God?&#8221; Today we have the answer to this question. We come and appear before God when we come into the local church. Verse 4: &#8220;When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God.&#8221; This was the remembrance of the enjoyment of the house of God. That was the time when he appeared before God. When shall I come and appear before God? When I come with the multitude to the house of God, when I enter His house, when I am in His presence, that is the time I appear before Him.<p>Brothers and sisters, let me check with you. Where is it that you sense most deeply that you are in God&#8217;s presence? I believe that you must answer that you sense God&#8217;s presence the most when you are in the local churches. I cannot tell you how many times, when I was in the meetings of the local churches, I was just before God. When I came with the multitude to the house of God, to the local church, I appeared before Him.<p>Then we read, &#8220;I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise.&#8221; Even before we enter the house, there is joy and praise. I believe that this is the best verse to tell us the way to come to the meetings. Firstly, we must come with the multitude-it is better not to come by ourselves. Secondly, we should come with the voice of joy and praise. While we are on the way, either walking or driving, we may start the praising. Come to the meetings with the multitude; come to the meetings with the voice of joy and praise. I hope that one day, when Christians are going to the church meetings, everyone around will realize that they are on their way to the meeting because they are praising. Even in ancient times the Old Testament saints came to the house of God in such a wonderful way. How much more should we!<p>Psalm 43:3-4: &#8220;O send out thy light and thy truth.&#8221; For what? For knowledge, for teaching, for doctrines? No. &#8220;Let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.&#8221; The divine light plus the divine truth, the light and the reality, will bring us to the holy hill. How can we ascend into the hill of His holiness? By being led by the divine light and the divine reality. Hence we should pray today, &#8220;O God, send me Thy light and Thy reality; let them lead me; let them bring me unto Thy holy hill and to Thy tabernacles, the local churches.&#8221;<p>Again, have you seen the improvement? Now the saints desire to enjoy the house of God. They are so much for the hill and for the house of the Lord. This is far beyond any human concept we may naturally have. We need heavenly vision.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 45-A DEEPER ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>We enjoy the house so much now and we are praising, but after this we enjoy something of Christ in a much deeper way. In Psalm 45, Christ, being known by the saints more deeply, becomes the saints&#8217; sweeter experience in the local churches, and it is realized that His reign will be over all the earth through His believers, and He will be praised by all the peoples. None of those six Psalms of Christ-Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23 and 24-can compare with Psalm 45. It is so deep, so high, so sweet, so intimate, so precious, and so tender. I do not have words to describe how good Psalm 45 is. Listen to the opening verse: &#8220;My heart is bubbling over with a good matter.&#8221; (See margin, King James Version.) The meaning of the original verse is that there is something boiling or bubbling up within me. There is something burning within me; I am set on fire with a good matter. What is this good matter? We could fill an entire book with the description of this good matter from this Psalm and yet not exhaust it.<p>The Psalmist says, &#8220;I speak what I have composed touching the king.&#8221; He did not say, &#8220;touching justification by faith,&#8221; or, &#8220;touching eternal security.&#8221; He said, &#8220;touching the king&#8221;-Christ. Christ as the King is the good matter worthy of praising. When we speak of the King, we naturally respond with a sense of reverence. There is reverence here in Psalm 45, but it is a reverence with a sweet and tender feeling, an inner feeling of preciousness. &#8220;I speak what I have composed touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.&#8221; When I speak about the King, my tongue is better than any kind of pen; it is the living pen of a ready writer.<p>Then the Psalmist goes on to describe the King: &#8220;Thou art fairer than the children of men.&#8221; First he mentions the fairness of the Lord. He is a man, a fair man, the man who is fairer than all men. He did not say, &#8220;He is fairer,&#8221; but, &#8220;Thou art fairer.&#8221; This means that while he was speaking, he was in the sweet presence of the King. &#8220;Grace is poured upon thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.&#8221; Can you sense the tender and precious feeling? Do you share the feeling of the King being so dear and precious to you? He is fairer than all men, full of grace, blessed by God.<p>Then verse 3: &#8220;Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.&#8221; To us He is fair, but to the enemy He is mighty, and most mighty with glory and majesty. To us He has grace upon His lips, but to the enemy He has a sword upon His thigh. &#8220;And in thy majesty ride triumphantly&#8221; (v. 4). This is the riding on of Christ. As the Victor, Christ, in His majesty, is riding on triumphantly. At the time He ascended into the heavens He began His ride, and He is still riding on. Regardless of what the situation is on this earth, regardless of what the nations are doing, Christ is riding on triumphantly, prosperously. He is riding triumphantly &#8220;because of reality.&#8221; Only He is the reality. All that this world and its rulers have is vanity and falsehood. I have read the biographies, histories, and stories of many people who have been a help to the great of this earth. Eventually they say that they have been cheated. Eventually they realize the vanity, the falsehood, of this world&#8217;s leaders. Not one of Christ&#8217;s followers, not one believer in Christ could ever say that he has been cheated by Christ. I have been following Him for more than forty-five years, and I am so happy, so very happy, because I have the truth, the reality, forever with me. Nothing in my experience is empty or vain. It is because of His reality that Christ is riding on triumphantly.<p>It is also &#8220;because of meekness&#8221; that Christ rides triumphantly. Meekness is reality without any pride. Christ is riding on in a meek way with reality. Consider today&#8217;s situation: how meek the Lord is! People scorn and blaspheme Him, and it seems that there is no Christ in this universe. He is so meek! He also rides on triumphantly &#8220;because of righteousness.&#8221; And His &#8220;right hand shall teach thee awe-inspiring things.&#8221; I do believe that these are the judgments of Christ. On one hand He is so meek, but on the other hand He is waging a war. Christ has done many awe-inspiring things, and He will do even more in the coming days. Read the book of Revelation! &#8220;Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king&#8217;s enemies.&#8221; No doubt this is Christ fighting, and this is the victory in His fighting. &#8220;The people fall under thee.&#8221; That means that all the nations fall under Him. The book of Revelation records the fulfillment.<p>Verses 3, 4 and 5 mention His riding on and His fighting. This undoubtedly includes His coming back. He is riding and He will continue to ride until He comes back in victory. From the day He ascended to the heavens, He began to come back. Do you realize this? Never imagine that He has not yet begun to move. From the day of His ascension He began to ride on and ride back. He is riding back and fighting back in many ways, and one day He will be here-that will be the kingdom.<p>Verse 6 speaks of His kingdom: &#8220;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter.&#8221; No doubt this is the kingdom age. After His riding, fighting, and coming back, we have the kingdom with the throne. His throne is for ever and ever, the eternal throne. The authority, the scepter of His kingdom, is a right scepter. This is His reigning. He is God Himself; He will be the King, and He will reign over the entire earth.<p>Following this, the Psalmist comes back to Christ&#8217;s character, to His being. &#8220;Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness.&#8221; Righteousness represents everything related to God; anything righteous is related to God. Wickedness represents everything related to the wicked one, Satan. This means that the Lord loves all the things related to God and hates everything related to the evil one; He loves God and hates Satan. The Psalmist continues, &#8220;Therefore God, thy God...&#8221; In verse 6 he says, &#8220;O God,&#8221; but in this verse he says, &#8220;thy God.&#8221; This means that Christ is God, and God is Christ&#8217;s. &#8220;O God, thy God!&#8221; Praise the Lord, it is wonderful; we cannot explain it.<p>&#8220;Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.&#8221; Because He loves righteousness and hates wickedness, God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions. This verse does not mean that His companions are not anointed, but that they are anointed under Him. We are His companions, His anointed companions. He is anointed above us, and we are anointed under Him. He is the Anointed One, and we are the anointed ones, His anointed companions.<p>Verse 8: &#8220;All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia.&#8221; Garments in typology signify deeds or acts. So here we have the Lord&#8217;s deeds and actions, which smell of myrrh and aloes. In John 19:39-40 we see that Christ was buried with these two spices-myrrh and aloes. Hence these signify the preciousness and sweetness of the Lord&#8217;s death. Cassia is a kind of root that produces a fragrant oil which is good for healing. Therefore, cassia signifies the fragrance of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Thus, with all the doings of the Lord, there is the sweet fragrance of His death and resurrection. Whatever He does, whatever He works, is filled with the savor of His death and resurrection-the myrrh and the aloes plus the cassia.<p>The Psalmist continues, &#8220;Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.&#8221; Ivory is a kind of bone, and bone in typology signifies the unbroken, resurrection life of Christ. Not one of Christ&#8217;s bones was broken (John 19:33, 36); His bones were unbreakable. This signifies that His life can never be broken. Hence, the ivory palaces signify that all the local churches are built up with His resurrection life. Out of these palaces, stringed instruments make Him glad. All these verses are poetic expressions. Therefore, the stringed instruments speak of the sweet, melodious, harmonious praises. Whenever we meet in all the local churches, the first thing, the main thing, the central thing, must be the singing, the praising. The outstanding feature of Christianity today is teaching. Henceforth, we must downgrade teaching and give first place in our meetings to praising the Lord. In all the local churches praising must be the central feature, because out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments make Him glad.<p>In Psalms 42, 43, and 44 we have the appreciation of the house. Now in the house the saints experience Christ in a deeper way. Hence, following Psalms 42 to 44, we have Psalm 45. Everything concerning Christ here is deeper in our experience. We do not have adequate utterance; we can only indicate a little.<p>The first section of Psalm 45 is praise to Christ as the King. He is a King who is so precious to His people, yet One who is so mighty, so awe-inspiring to His enemies. He is riding on, He is riding back, and He is riding into His kingdom. And all of His doings are full of the fragrance of His death and resurrection. He is really worthy of our praise. We must fill all the local churches with praises to Him; then we will make Him glad.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE TO THE KING ABOUT THE QUEEN AND THE CHILDREN</h2><p>Beginning with verse 9, we enter the second section of Psalm 45. It is the praise to the King, but about the queen. In other words, the queen becomes the praise of the King. If you would praise the King, you must say something concerning the queen, because the queen is part of the King. In the first section, verses 1 to 8, the praises are to the King about the King. In the second section, verses 9 through 15, the praises are to the King, but about the queen. In the third and last section of the Psalm, verses 16 and 17, the praises are also to the King, but about His children. Therefore, the whole Psalm is praise to the King, but the first section is praise about the King, the second section is praise about the queen, and the third section is praise about the King&#8217;s children, the princes.<p>Psalm 45 in its entirety is written about Christ, yet it is written from the aspect of human relationships. As a human being, you, of course, have yourself; but as a normal human being you also need a wife. Eventually, to be completed and perfected as a human being, you need children. Christ is not a bachelor; He is the King with the queen and all the children. If you would render Him complete praise, you must say something about Himself, something about His queen, and something concerning His children. His glory is not only in Himself; it is also in His queen and His children. The riches and fullness of a man are in his wife and family; likewise, the riches and fullness of Christ are in His church with all His children. Thus there are three sections of this wonderful, marvelous, unique praise of Christ: the praises about the King, about the queen, and about the royal children.<p>Christ&#8217;s glory is not only in Himself, but also in the church. If we would see Christ&#8217;s glory in Himself, we must read the four Gospels. If we would see the glory and beauty of Christ in the church with so many saints, we must read the Epistles. It is the church &#8220;with&#8221; so many saints, not the church &#8220;and&#8221; so many saints (2 Cor. 1:1). It is the queen with so many virgins, the queen with the King&#8217;s daughters, the queen with the honorable women. We must also see Christ&#8217;s beauty in His children, in His princes. In the book of Revelation, we have the local churches, and we also have the princes, those who will reign with Christ (Rev. 20). We see there the Lord&#8217;s beauty in His sons, the overcomers.<p>We have seen in the Psalms how God turned the saints&#8217; concept from the law to Christ. We have also seen that out of Christ we have the church, the house. In the Psalms, Christ and the church are put together. Christ is here as the King and the church is here as the queen, the husband and the wife. The two are one; they are no more two, but one.<p>In verse 8 the church is mentioned as the ivory palaces; then in verse 9 the church is pictured as the queen. The palaces are the building, and the queen is the wife. In the entire Bible, God always uses these two figures to signify the church-the building and the bride. Even in Genesis 2 we have these two figures: firstly, the materials for the building, and secondly, a bride, Eve. Then, when we come to the end of the Bible, we have a building, a city, which is the Bride. The church on one hand is a palace to Christ, and on the other hand it is His queen. On one hand it is the house of God, and on the other hand it is the Bride of Christ.<p>Now let us read verse 9: &#8220;Kings&#8217; daughters were among thy honorable women.&#8221; If you are praising Christ, you can never forget the church. This verse is a praise to Christ, but about the saints, the kings&#8217; daughters. Spiritually speaking, we are all females before the Lord, we are all the kings&#8217; daughters. We were poor sinners, but now we are royal, we are kingly. The kings&#8217; daughters are the honorable women. The saints are the saints among the saints. Do not imagine that the kings&#8217; daughters are one group and the honorable women are another. They are both one. The kings&#8217; daughters speak of our royalty, and the honorable women of our honor and majesty. We should not be proud, but we must all realize that we are kingly and honorable. When we walk on the street, do people sense something honorable about us? We should not forget our royal and honorable estate. We are the kings&#8217; daughters and the honorable women. This is praise about us, but it is praise to Christ. If others say, &#8220;Look at those poor Christians, what miserable beggars they are!&#8221; that is a shame to Christ. However, when people recognize or sense in us something of our royal and honorable estate, though they may not agree with us, that is a real glory to Christ.<p>Verse 9 goes on to say, &#8220;Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.&#8221; The kings&#8217; daughters are the saints, and the queen is the church. Individually speaking, we are the saints, but corporately speaking, we are the church. We are all one queen; the queen is a corporate body. She is at His right hand. Brothers, if you have your dear wife standing at your side, and I speak commendably of her, you will feel happy. The praise is about your dear wife, but it goes to you. The praise here is about the queen, but it goes to the King. When we say, &#8220;Look, look at the resplendent glory of that golden queen,&#8221; the glory goes to Christ. Every time we speak well of the church, Christ in heaven is made glad. When we say, &#8220;Praise the Lord for the church in Chicago,&#8221; or, &#8220;Praise the Lord for the church in Atlanta,&#8221; He is well pleased. Whenever we speak well of the local churches, it is a kind of praise to Christ.<p>The praise about the King should undoubtedly come first, but the praise concerning the queen should follow. Suppose you were the King: what part of the praise would make you happier? If I were the King, I would delight more in the praise about the queen. Christ is deeply gratified when we speak well of the local churches. Our praises must be not only about Christ, but many times about the queen, about the churches.<p>The queen is seen in gold of Ophir. Gold in typology signifies the divine nature. The church&#8217;s beauty is not in anything but the divine nature. She is royal and she is divine; she is in gold of Ophir, the best gold.<p>Then the Psalmist immediately turns to the queen and says, &#8220;Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father&#8217;s house.&#8221; Instead of praises here we have an instruction to the queen which is exceedingly meaningful. Sometimes even the instructions given to the local churches are the same as praises in the ears of Christ. Why? Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises. These are the instructions: Hearken and forget. All the local churches must learn how to hear and how to forget, how to hear the Spirit&#8217;s living, up-to-date speaking, and how to forget the past-the old relationships, the old ways, the old background. We must forget our people and our father&#8217;s house-&#8220;so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty.&#8221; The more we forget the past, the more beautiful we become in His eyes. Whenever I hear some people speak of their past, I have the sense of ugliness. If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the King&#8217;s eyes.<p>In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord. Because He is the Lord, He is worthy of our worship. &#8220;He is thy Lord; and worship thou him.&#8221; The Bible allows us to worship only God; anything or anyone that is not God, we should not worship. But here we have proper worship, because it is worship of the Lord. He is the King, He is a man, He is God, and He is the Lord-He is everything! Worship Him!<p>Verse 12: &#8220;And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.&#8221; Here we see that if the local church is in a proper condition, the people of the earth will come to it. Not only the poor and the lowly will come, but the rich and the honorable, on the one hand with a gift, and on the other hand to entreat the church&#8217;s favor. All these are praises about the church, but praises to Christ.<p>Now let us go on to verse 13: &#8220;The king&#8217;s daughter is all glorious within the inner part of the palaces: her clothing is of wrought gold.&#8221; Here we have not the daughters, but the daughter. In verse 9 we read that the queen was arrayed in gold, but here the clothing is of wrought gold. Gold, as we have seen, signifies the nature of God. Wrought gold, however, signifies Christ. Christ is not only gold, but wrought gold. He, with His divine nature, has undergone so many sufferings and has been dealt with in so many ways that the gold in Him has become wrought gold. Now this wrought gold, this Christ, has become our clothing, our righteousness, that we may stand justified in the presence of God. In the eyes of God, we are clothed with Christ as the acceptable righteousness. Christ is our righteousness before God.<p>Then verse 14: &#8220;She [the queen] shall be brought unto the king.&#8221; It does not say that she will be brought unto God, but unto the King. Wrought gold is sufficient for us to abide in the presence of God, but an added factor is necessary that we may stand in the presence of the King. &#8220;She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of broidered work.&#8221; This raiment of embroidered work is the pure and white linen mentioned as the righteousness of the saints in Revelation 19. What is this? The clothing of wrought gold, as we have seen, is Christ. The raiment of embroidered work here is also Christ. But the first is the objective Christ; the second is the subjective Christ. The objective Christ is our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God; the subjective Christ is Christ Himself woven into our character, embroidered into our being, that we may stand before the King. The latter is not merely a garment that we put on, but one that is worked into us, stitch by stitch. Christ as the wrought gold is the righteousness put upon us-that is our justification. But following that, the Holy Spirit is working day by day to embroider Christ into us stitch after stitch. Thus, we will have another raiment. We will have two robes: the first is for the Father&#8217;s satisfaction; the second is for Christ&#8217;s satisfaction. It is by the second that we will be brought unto Christ. All these are definitions and descriptions of the church, but praises unto Christ.<p>I believe that nearly all of you have the wrought gold as your clothing. You have joyful assurance that you have been justified. But suppose that today you should be brought unto Christ. How would you feel? On one hand you have been justified, but on the other hand you are short of Christ being wrought into your being. There is a real shortage of the embroidery. From the day you were justified until today, how many stitches have been embroidered into your being?<p>All the brothers and sisters in the church life are indeed precious, and we praise the Lord for them. But in another sense everyone is a little needle. In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being. Then we will have a raiment of embroidered work to satisfy Christ. In Revelation 19 we see that it is by this garment the bride is made ready for the wedding. This is the garment of broidered work mentioned in Psalm 45. Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ.<p>Verses 14 and 15: &#8220;The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king&#8217;s palace.&#8221; The virgins also are the saints. They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing-they are all praises to Christ. They shall enter into the King&#8217;s palace. All the saints shall be brought into the New Jerusalem.<p>Now we come to the third section of the Psalm, the praise to the King about His children. Verse 16: &#8220;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.&#8221; On one hand we are the daughters and the virgins, but on the other hand we are the princes, the children of Christ, who will rule the earth under Him. In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes. Then all the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&#8221;<p>Verse 17: &#8220;I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever.&#8221; How could Christ be on earth with all the people praising Him for ever and ever? It is through the princes, through His children, through us. To satisfy Him we are the virgins, the kings&#8217; daughters. To rule for Him we are the princes. He will rule over all the earth through us as His princes and will be praised by all peoples through us.<p>I believe that this Psalm, Psalm 45, is the richest Psalm concerning Christ. No human mind could compose such a Psalm; it is far beyond human mentality. In such a short Psalm of only seventeen verses, how many aspects, how many points, how many items there are!

Then, when the church is strengthened and enlarged, it becomes not only the house in which God dwells, but also the city in which God rules. The church is the house for God&#8217;s home and the city for God&#8217;s kingdom.<p>We have also seen that the Psalms are of five books. Some versions of the Bible have all five books clearly indicated. Let us define them again. Book I, Psalms 1 to 41; Book II, Psalms 42 through 72; Book III, Psalms 73 through 89; Book IV, Psalms 90 to 106; and Book V, Psalms 107 to 150. It is good for us to remember the divisions of these five books.<p>As we have clearly seen, all the praises of the Psalmists began with the law. Because they were human, because they were religious, and because they were so well taught in the law, their concept was naturally law-centered. We cannot criticize them: that was their background. But they were near to God and open to Him, and they were deeply in fellowship with God. Hence, when they were praising according to their religious concept, the Spirit of Christ was given the opportunity to speak. It was in this way that their praises, though they did not realize it, were shifted from their concept of the law to the concept of God concerning Christ. In all the Psalms, there is this transition. It is like driving a car in one lane of the highway and then suddenly shifting unconsciously to another lane. While the Psalmist was scribing Psalm 1, someone who was subconsciously with him in the driver&#8217;s seat shifted to another lane in Psalm 2. His intention was to drive in the left lane, but eventually he shifted to the right, not by himself, but by someone subconsciously with him. This is marvelous! Hallelujah, the concepts of the Psalms have been shifted from the law to Christ!<h2 class=head1>INTRODUCTION OF THE HOUSE AND CITY</h2><p>In Book I, especially in Psalm 23, the concept of the house of God was introduced through Christ. By the shepherding of Christ in His resurrection life, the saints are led into the house, where they say, &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.&#8221; It is immensely significant that the house is introduced in this way. All of Christ&#8217;s shepherding is to bring the saints into the house.<p>Next, in Psalm 24, we have seen that the holy hill is the stepping-stone for Christ to regain the entire earth. Thus, the hill is not only for the house, but also for the city. Therefore, in the first book we have the introduction of the concept of the house with the hill, which is for the city.<p>Following Psalm 24, we have all those Psalms in the last part of Book I, Psalms 25 to 41, concerning the house. Do you still remember all those verses? They are marvelous! We should pray-read those verses a hundred times!<p>Christianity, as we have seen, is poverty stricken in the application of the Psalms. There the Psalms are applied mostly for a kind of comfort. When you are sick, you may read a portion of the Psalms regarding the Lord&#8217;s healing. If you are in some other situation of need, the pastor may come and read Psalm 23, &#8220;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.&#8221; Some advanced Christians, however, have seen something in the Psalms concerning Christ. Martin Luther, for instance, said that Psalms 110 and 118 are the greatest of all the Psalms, for these Psalms speak of Christ. This proves that he saw something of Christ in the Psalms. Some Christians, therefore, apply the Psalms not just for comfort, but for the experience of Christ. But it is rather difficult to find among all Christian books any book saying that in the Psalms we find not only Christ, but also the church as the house and city of God. Have you ever heard of such a book?<p>The Lord is merciful to us! He has drawn aside the veil and shown us that in the Psalms the primary concern is not comfort, but Christ, and following Christ, the church as the house and city of God. You must pray-read all these verses again and again until you are mingled and saturated with Christ and with the church as the house and city of God.<p>Many criticize and condemn our emphasis on the church. Why must the church be stressed? Because Christianity does not care for the church. Because Christianity is so unbalanced, the Lord must do some balancing. Have you ever seen the house of the Lord as the practical church life in the Psalms? Have you ever been taught concerning this matter? The house! The house! You have to see the house!<p>Consider again Psalm 31:21: &#8220;Blessed be the Lord: for he hath showed me his marvelous lovingkindness in a strong city.&#8221; It does not speak of any other strong things, but &#8220;a strong city.&#8221; Hence, so far we have the law, Christ, the house and the city.<p>We have seen how Book II begins with the house. The Psalmist speaks of the house in the way of remembrance. He recalls how in the past he came to the house of God with a multitude, with the voice of joy and praise. It is after these Psalms on the house, then, that we come to Psalm 45, where we encounter a richer and deeper experience of Christ. As Christ is known by the saints in a deeper way, He becomes the saints&#8217; sweeter experience in the local churches.<p>Following these deeper and sweeter experiences of Christ in such an intimate way, we come immediately to Psalms 46 through 48. These are three Psalms on the church as the city of God. In these Psalms we reach the climax of the city. The climax of the house is in Psalms 27 through 36; now in Psalms 46, 47, and 48, we have the climax of the city.<p>In Book I we have merely one short phrase concerning the city-&#8220;in a strong city.&#8221; That is all. But now, when we come to Psalms 46 through 48 in Book II, we reach the peak concerning the city. Book II is mainly for the city. Do you see the improvement? With the deeper and sweeter experiences of Christ, we have the climax of the city.<p>Psalms 46 through 48 tell us how God dwells in the city, His habitation, the church, to be experienced by the saints as their refuge, strength, and ready help, that in Christ He may be the King over all the earth.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 46-GOD MEETING OUR NEEDS IN THE CITY</h2><p>&#8220;God is our refuge and strength, a very ready help in trouble&#8221; (v. 1). Where is God our refuge, our strength, and a very ready help in trouble? In the city! God is all this to us in the city. Verses 2 and 3 then tell us something as a background for the city. &#8220;Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. There is a river.&#8221; There is a sea in verse 2. The sea is in the earth, but in the city there is a river, &#8220;the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.&#8221; This river signifies the flowing of God Himself as life to us; it signifies the river of life, which is mentioned in Revelation 22. The river of life is nothing less than God Himself in Christ through the Spirit as our life. The streams of this river make glad the city of God.<p>Now we know that the city of God is the church strengthened, built up, and enlarged. In Psalms 46 through 48 the church has become the city over which God rules and from which God reigns. It is not just the house for the Father&#8217;s home, but also the city for God&#8217;s rule in His kingdom. The city of God is the enlarged, strengthened, and built-up church as the ruling center of God in His kingdom. It is in this city that we have the river. The picture here corresponds to that of the New Jerusalem found in Revelation 21 and 22. In those chapters we also see a city with a flowing river. Here we have a river with many streams to make the city glad.<p>We are so very happy because of this river, this flow of the divine life. If we did not have the flow of life, we would be shriveled and withered. Our joy would be gone; there would be no gladness. We are the most joyful people because in the city, in the church, we have a flow of living water-not just a trickle, but a river.<p>This holy city of God is &#8220;the holy place of the tabernacles (or habitations) of the most High&#8221; (v. 4). You must pay attention to all these titles. The most high God dwells here; this is the holy place of His habitations.<p>Then verse 5 says, &#8220;God is in the midst of her&#8221;-in the midst of the enlarged church. &#8220;She shall not be moved.&#8221; The earth will be moved and the mountains will be carried away, but the city will never be moved. Why? Because the immovable God is within her. God is immovable; so she is immovable. &#8220;God shall help her at the dawn of the morning.&#8221; If we are in the local church, we are in the morning; if we are outside the local church, we are simply in the night. In the church there is always the dawn of the morning, and when you are in the morning, God is your help. &#8220;God shall help her at the dawn of the morning,&#8221; after the night of trial.<p>Verse 6: &#8220;The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.&#8221; Why? Because He is in the city. Verses 7 through 10: &#8220;The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still, and know that I am God.&#8221; These verses are a kind of prophecy. When God has a church on this earth so strengthened and enlarged that it may be reckoned as a city, He will then have the ground to deal with the nations and possess the entire earth. The nations today are raging. But God will one day obtain a church as a city, and at that time He will say to all the nations, &#8220;Be still, and know that I am God.&#8221; God could not say this today, for He lacks such a strong church. God has not yet obtained a stronghold on this earth for Him to speak in such a way to the nations. But He will have it. Verse 10 continues, &#8220;I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.&#8221; When God has a church so strengthened, so much enlarged and built up as a city to Him, He can say, &#8220;I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.&#8221;<p>Finally, in the city we may say, &#8220;The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah&#8221; (v. 11).<h2 class=head1>PSALM 47-GOD IN CHRIST RULING OVER ALL THE EARTH THROUGH THE CITY</h2><p>Psalm 47 is a continuation to Psalm 46. In Psalm 46 God is our enjoyment, meeting our needs in the needful hours. Then, Psalm 47 continues by telling us that this very God who meets our needs in the city will be, in Christ, the King over all the earth through the city, the strengthened and enlarged church. Verse 1: &#8220;O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.&#8221; When the church is truly enlarged as a city, in which we enjoy God as our everything, we will surely clap our hands. In such a church life, how can we help but shout unto God with the voice of triumph! Christians today remain so silent in their services because they are not in the proper church life, because they do not have God as their enjoyment in their needs, because they are short of God in their experiences through the proper church life.<p>Verses 2 and 3: &#8220;The Lord most high...is a great King over all the earth. He shall subdue the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.&#8221; These are all God&#8217;s doings in Christ through the city, the enlarged church. When the church is enlarged as a city, God shall subdue the peoples through the city and rule over all the earth in Christ as a great King. Without such a church it would be difficult for God to accomplish this. It is the church enlarged as a city that will bring the entire earth under God&#8217;s authority and kingship in Christ.<p>Verses 5 through 9: &#8220;God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness....He is greatly exalted.&#8221; All these marvelous things will take place because God has obtained a city as a base on the earth. The church must be built up as a city that God might have a base on the earth for His move. It is through the strengthened and enlarged church that God in Christ is praised and exalted as the King of all the earth, reigning over all the nations.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 48-GOD IN THE CLIMACTIC EXPERIENCE OF THE CITY</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 48. &#8220;Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God.&#8221; Here we reach the climax of the city. Only in the city, only in the strong and enlarged church, could God be great and greatly praised. Do you think that God could be so great among two or three meeting together in a home? Could God be greatly praised in such a situation? Yes, God will be great, but in a pitiful way. If we would have God greatly manifested, we need a strong church, a city. Two or three persons meeting together are not a city, and you could hardly call them a house. They are a meager group, a poor free-group. How could God be great, and how could God be greatly praised? We need to be a city. We need to be strengthened, enlarged, and built up as a city. Then God&#8217;s greatness will be expressed.<p>Verse 2: &#8220;Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.&#8221; When the church is strengthened, enlarged, and built up as a city, there is an elevation in the earth. The church is elevated, and that elevation is the beauty of the church. Beautiful in elevation is mount Zion. Such a church, such a city, is the joy of the whole earth. It is in this city that God is the great King, and this great King is God in Christ-Christ Himself. In the house He is the great Father, but in the city He is the great King.<p>Verse 3: &#8220;God is known in her palaces for a high fortress.&#8221; The city is the church, and the palaces are the local churches. God is known in all the local churches of the church. If you would know God as a refuge, as a high tower, and as a high fortress, you must be in the local churches.<p>Verse 4: &#8220;For, lo, the kings conspired together, they passed by together.&#8221; Why? Because they saw the church, because they saw such a stronghold. Verse 5: &#8220;They saw it, and so they were amazed; they were overwhelmed and fled in terror.&#8221; Just to look at such a built-up church caused the enemies to flee in terror.<p>In Brother Watchman Nee&#8217;s three-volume book, The Spiritual Man, there is a section concerning spiritual warfare. That section was composed mostly from articles written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis concerning the experiences of Evan Roberts of Wales, the leader of the Welsh revival of 1904. Evan Roberts himself experienced considerable spiritual warfare, but what he experienced was only on an individual, personal level. He was not able to record his experiences (he was a worker in a coal mine); so he related them to Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who put them into writing. At that time the church on this earth had failed to see that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter. In the years 1920-1924, Brother Nee read all these books and received help; hence, he extracted all these things and put them together as a chapter in his book, The Spiritual Man. In the first edition of that book in Chinese, he mentioned this fact clearly in his preface. Following the publishing of this book, in the years 1937 through 1940, Brother Nee began to see that spiritual warfare is not to be engaged in as an individual, but with the Body. At that time, by the mercy of God, Brother Nee came to see the Body in a practical way and gave many messages on this matter. He pointed out from Ephesians 6 that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter. The warrior, the soldier, mentioned in that chapter is not any single individual, but the Body of Christ. The whole Body is the warrior. After that, he gave a number of messages on spiritual warfare undertaken by the Body. He indicated that in the time of Evan Roberts it was really difficult to gain the victory, but now, since we have seen the battle is a matter of the Body, we need only abide in the Body and the enemy will flee. Praise the Lord! Therefore, in The Spiritual Man the part regarding spiritual warfare is no longer up-to-date. Spiritual warfare, as presented there, is not according to the light the Lord has shown His church today. This was one of the reasons Brother Nee would not have The Spiritual Man re-published.<p>In Psalm 48, when the enemies see the church, they flee in terror. As long as we are in the church as a stronghold on this earth, no enemy can prevail. The Lord said, &#8220;I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&#8221; (Matt. 16:18). Amen, hallelujah! Spiritual warfare is simply a matter of getting yourself into the city. When you are in the city, you will see how the enemies will flee. This is not a mere teaching; we do have the experience. Before I came into the local church, it was really difficult for me to overcome many things, even the little besetting sins. But since I have come into the church, I have simply been in the tower, watching the enemies flee. I&#8217;m not fighting; I&#8217;m in the tower watching. Hallelujah! The enemies flee, they flee! This is the spiritual warfare.<p>Then verse 6: &#8220;Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.&#8221; Fear took hold of them, not us. We are in the high tower watching. Then verse 8: &#8220;As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.&#8221; We have heard something of the ancient times; now we are seeing these things. &#8220;As we have heard, so have we seen.&#8221; Where? &#8220;In the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.&#8221; Brothers and sisters, can you say this? When we come into the church as the city of God, we can really say this. &#8220;God will establish it forever. Selah.&#8221;<p>Verse 9: &#8220;We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.&#8221; It is really good! The enemies flee, and we think of the lovingkindness of God. Their business is to run, and ours is to consider the lovingkindness of God in His temple. Verses 10 and 11: &#8220;According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.&#8221;<p>Now we have two wonderful verses, 12 and 13: &#8220;Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof. Set your heart on her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.&#8221; Inside the city we have the palaces, and outside we have the bulwarks. We must consider all these. We should be able to recite at least these two verses, 12 and 13, of Psalm 48. You may ask the Psalmist, &#8220;Why do you emphasize the city so much? Why don&#8217;t you speak more about Christ?&#8221; He would answer, &#8220;Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof. Set your heart on her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.&#8221; This is his answer. If you have ever seen such a church life, you can understand why the Psalmist was so excited about the city of God.<p>Finally, we have verse 14: &#8220;For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.&#8221; Which God is our God? The God of the city. &#8220;This God is our God for ever and ever.&#8221; It is so good. And He will be our guide even unto death. If you are outside of the local church you are wandering, you are astray. But when you come into the church, you have a guide. In the church as the city, our guide is our God.<p class=hbody>O walk about, walk about Zion,<br>Go round about her in love.<br>O walk about, walk about Zion<br>And count the towers thereof.</p><p class=hbody>O set your heart on her bulwarks,<br>O set your heart on her walls,<br>O set your heart on her bulwarks,<br>Consider her palaces.</p><p class=hbody>In elevation how beauteous,<br>The joy of all the earth!<br>In elevation how beauteous<br>Is Zion, that city of worth!</p><p class=hbody>O there is a river in Zion<br>That flows so deep and so broad.<br>O how the streams of that river<br>Make glad the city of God!</p><p class=hbody>Praise waiteth for Thee, Lord, in Zion,<br>Praise waiteth, O God, for Thee,<br>Praise waiteth for Thee, Lord, in Zion,<br>For Zion is filled with Thee.</p><p class=hbody>How great the Lord is in Zion,<br>How greatly to be praised,<br>How great He is in that city<br>Which over the earth is raised.</p><p class=hbody>O bless the Lord out of Zion,<br>O let His praises swell,<br>O bless the Lord out of Zion,<br>Ye who in Jerusalem dwell.</p><p class=hbody>The Lord bless thee out of Zion,<br>The Lord bless thee o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er!<br>The Lord bless thee out of Zion<br>With life for evermore!</p><p class=hbody>Behold how good and how pleasant<br>With all the brethren to be!<br>Behold how good and how pleasant<br>To dwell in unity!</p><p class=hbody>O tell it to all generations,<br>O tell it to all who will come,<br>O tell it to all generations,<br>The Spirit and Bride say, &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #1223)</p><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 49 to 67</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 50:2; 51:18-19; 52:8; 53:6a; 55:14; 61:4; 63:1-2; 65:1, 4; 66:13</h1><p>In Book I of the Psalms Christ is emphasized and the house of God is then sweetly presented. Many dear Christians who love the Psalms have failed to see this. A few have seen Christ, but hardly one has really seen the house of God. Book I of the Psalms has both Christ Himself and the house of God. Book II presents Christ and the house again, but it brings us on in a marvelous way to see the strengthened, enlarged, and built-up house, the city. In Psalms 46, 47 and 48, we are brought to the climax of the city. These Psalms describe the city to the uttermost. Following these three Psalms, we still have many wonderful and precious verses concerning the house and the city. Such verses as these are not found in the first book and especially not before Psalm 22.<h2 class=head1>MORE CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p>Psalms 49 through 67 tell us how the saints enjoy the house and the city of God through Christ. Firstly we must indicate the various verses in this section which speak further concerning Christ. (1) He suffered the plot of men (Psa. 56:6, cf. Luke 11:54; John 11:57). (2) He was betrayed by His friend (Psa. 55:13, cf. Matt. 26:50). (3) He was falsely accused by the people (Psa. 55:3, cf. Matt. 26:59-68; John 18:30; 19:7). (4) He was assailed by the assembly of the adversaries (Psa. 62:3-4, cf. Matt. 26:3-4, 57, 59).<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS&#8217; ENJOYMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE CITY OF GOD</h2><p>Secondly, we come to the saints&#8217; enjoyment of the house and the city of God. We have to spend some time to consider these verses. Firstly we see that the church, the dwelling place of God, is the perfection of beauty out of which God shines. &#8220;Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined&#8221; (Psa. 50:2). Zion in typology is the church. It does not say that the church is the perfect beauty, but the perfection of beauty. It is very meaningful. In the eyes of God the most beautiful object in the entire universe is the church. On the first day of God&#8217;s recovery of creation, as recorded in Genesis 1, God only said, &#8220;It is good.&#8221; On the second day God made the firmament, which divided the waters above from the waters beneath. However, on that day God did not say, &#8220;It is good,&#8221; because in the waters beneath there were the demons, and in the air above there was the subtle one, Satan. Even though the firmament was good, God would not say that the work of that day was good. But on the third, fourth, and fifth days, God continually said, &#8220;It is good.&#8221; Then on the sixth day, when man was created, God said, &#8220;It is exceedingly good.&#8221; In God&#8217;s eyes, nothing in all His creation is so beautiful as man. But today, in all God&#8217;s creation plus His redemption, nothing is so beautiful as the church. The church is the perfection of beauty.<p>Have you ever looked at the New Jerusalem? Oh, the New Jerusalem! Look at it! Is that not the perfection of beauty? Is there anything in the universe more beautiful than the New Jerusalem? The entire city is of gold, transparent gold, with nothing opaque. There are twelve gates, and each gate is one tremendous pearl. The foundation is made of precious stones, layer upon layer, and the wall is also built up of gems. God is within the city as the shining light, and the entire city radiates the glory of God. Could anything be more beautiful than this? It is the perfection of beauty. One day, when we are all there in the New Jerusalem, we will exclaim, &#8220;O Lord, now we are really in the perfection of beauty!&#8221; It is not only beautiful; it is the perfection of beauty. Nothing could be more perfect; nothing could be more beautiful. This is the church!<p>While we are still in this old age, while we are still on this old earth, in my realization, the church is even now the perfection of beauty. You may say that it is not so perfect. In a sense, it is not, but in another sense, I would ask if you can find anything better. Never! I have passed through all kinds of human societies: I have been with the poor; I have been with the rich; I have been with the low-class as well as the high-class; I have been with the educated and with the uneducated. According to my experience, I must testify that in my entire life on this earth I have never found anything better than the local churches. To me this is the perfection of beauty, out from which God shines. &#8220;Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.&#8221; Praise the Lord!<p>Furthermore, in Psalm 51:18 the Psalmist says, &#8220;Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion.&#8221; Can you explain what it means for God to &#8220;do good&#8221; unto Zion? Sometimes we just read over these verses without at all realizing their intent. I believe that according to the context of all these Psalms the &#8220;good&#8221; mentioned here includes many things. It includes the building up of the wall of the city, as mentioned in the last part of the verse. The building up of the walls of Jerusalem is indeed one item of the &#8220;good.&#8221; Following that, the city must have the glory of God. God must fill it with His glory. Then the presence of God must be continually with the city, and God&#8217;s very presence supplies the peace, the joy, the light, the life, the security, and all the blessings of the city. The &#8220;good&#8221; here includes all these things. We also need to pray in this way: &#8220;Do good unto the church in thy good pleasure.&#8221; And when we pray we must have faith to believe that the Lord is going to do good. The Lord will build up the church, He will fill it with His glory, His very presence will be with the church, and His presence will bring joy, peace, life, light, security, and all kinds of blessings. In all the years that I have been in this country for the Lord&#8217;s testimony, I have had the assurance that the Lord is going to do good in His good pleasure to the church. He is going to build up the church, fill it with His glory, and grant the church His presence with abundant spiritual blessing. Praise the Lord! Many of us can testify how wonderfully the Lord has already done good in His good pleasure unto His church in this land.<p>Psalm 52:8 goes on to tell how the saints grow in the house of God and trust in His lovingkindness. &#8220;But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.&#8221; Nearly all the verses in the Psalms concerning the house of God include the meaning of the house being a place not only for God but also for us to dwell. From the very first mention of the house in the Psalms, &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever,&#8221; the house is not only God&#8217;s dwelling place, it is our dwelling place. Praise the Lord! But in Psalm 52:8 the meaning implied is even deeper and stronger than dwelling in the house. The Psalmist compares himself to a green olive tree planted in the house of God. If you are only dwelling in the house, you may easily move out, but if you are planted in the house of God, it is extremely difficult for you to leave. Let me ask you, brothers and sisters, are you dwelling in the house of God, or are you planted in the house of God? Before we can grow in the house, we must be planted there. The Psalmist says he is like a green olive tree-he is not withered, but green and growing. The house of God is not only a place to dwell, but a place to grow. And the olive tree is a tree which produces oil, the type of the Spirit. It is so meaningful. May we all be green olive trees in the house of God.<p>The Psalmist continues, &#8220;I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.&#8221; Many times people say that they trust in God. But if you are not in God&#8217;s house, it is rather difficult for you to put your trust in God. In a strict sense God is in His house; hence, if you are not in His house, how can you put your trust in Him? You may endeavor, you may struggle, and you may do many things to trust in God; but when you come into the local church, God&#8217;s house, it is extremely easy. To trust in God means to be in God&#8217;s house.<p>Furthermore, the salvation of God&#8217;s people comes out of the local churches. Psalm 53:6, &#8220;Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!&#8221; It is in the local churches that we are saved from so many things. We are saved from our worldliness, from our temper, from our selves, from our old background, from religion, from empty teachings and dead letters and from so many other things.<p>Then in Psalm 55:14, the Psalmist said that he &#8220;took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.&#8221; The Psalms have been in my hands for years, but not until recently did I notice this verse. To be in the house of God is really too good; so whenever we talk about it, it is a kind of sweet counsel. Hallelujah! Brothers, let us take sweet counsel together; then let us walk to the house of God in company. The house of God is so sweet to us.<p>Moreover, the saints long to abide in God&#8217;s tabernacle for ever and enjoy the shelter of God&#8217;s wings (Psa. 61:4). When we abide in the house of God, we are sheltered beneath God&#8217;s wings. What an enjoyment this is! God is like a great hen, and we are like little chicks abiding under His wings. We are sheltered by His wings, and we are also sheltered by His house. We are doubly sheltered. How safe it is! How sweet it is! I do believe many of you have this feeling when you are in the local church.<p>In Psalm 63 we see a further aspect of the saints&#8217; enjoyment of the house: They looked upon God in his sanctuary to see his power and his glory. &#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is&#8221; (v. 1). This experience is similar to that of a dear brother who has been in the church, but who is now out of it. He is in a dry and thirsty place without water; so he is longing for satisfaction. He is longing for that which is mentioned in verse 2, &#8220;to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have looked upon thee in the sanctuary.&#8221; Perhaps you are in the local church now, and you sense that it is good, but you do not sense how wonderfully good it is. If, however, you are cut off from the local church and brought to a place where there is no church, at that time you will pray the words of the Psalmist in these verses. You will long to be where you have been in the past; you will thirst for God and yearn to see His power and glory as you have looked upon Him in the sanctuary. The sanctuary is not a dry and thirsty place; the house of God is not a place without water. In the sanctuary there is a river. Once you have looked upon the Lord in the sanctuary, once you have drunk of the river of God in the sanctuary and then are brought away to a dry place, at that time you will realize the difference. How grateful we all should be to be in the local church, where we may enjoy Him in the sanctuary. What enjoyment this is! Both these verses and our experience prove that the local churches arc the places with water, places where we may look upon the Lord and see the power and glory of God.<p>Then we see how the saints in Zion praise and wait for God! &#8220;Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion&#8221; (Psa. 65:1). Brothers and sisters, whenever we come together, are we ready to praise? Do we really have some praises waiting for God? From now on, whenever you come to the meeting, do not bring two ears itching for teachings, but two lips ready for praise. In 2 Timothy 4:3 the apostle Paul said, &#8220;The time will come when they will...heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.&#8221; People pile up teachers because of their itching ears. We need praising lips. Whenever you come to the church meetings, you should be prepared to praise. Even before you come, you must compose something touching the King. Then when you meet, your praise will be waiting for the Lord, waiting for God in Zion. Praise must be waiting for the Lord in the local churches.<p>Then, Psalm 65:4 says that to dwell in God&#8217;s courts and be satisfied with the goodness of His house is blessed by God. &#8220;Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.&#8221; In Psalm 36:8 we read, &#8220;They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house,&#8221; and here, &#8220;We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house.&#8221; If you would come to the local church and enjoy the goodness of the house of God, it is a strong proof that you have been chosen and blessed by God. I do not know what kind of wind He causes to blow us into His house, whether it is a wind from the west, the east, the north, or the south. Anyway, we are here. He has not only chosen us, but also caused us to dwell in His courts. Could you ever have dreamed that you would be in the local church? No, but praise the Lord, the Lord who has chosen us has also caused us to be here. The more we enjoy the fatness and goodness of the house, the stronger our assurance is that we have been chosen and caused by God to be in such a place. We must all bow before Him and say, &#8220;Lord, it is Thy doing; it is all of Thee that we are in Thy building today and not outside of it.&#8221;<p>In Psalm 66:13 the Psalmist says, &#8220;I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows.&#8221; The burnt offerings are the praises of Christ. The Lord has caused us to dwell in His courts, and now we may come to the house of God with praises of Christ as an offering. We learn to offer these praises as offerings to God. In all the local churches we need to be trained to praise Him that we may always have praise concerning Christ as an offering to God.<p>Finally, in Psalm 51:18, we see how the saints pray to God for the building up of the wall of Jerusalem. We all need to beseech God to build the walls of the city that we may have the full safeguard in the local churches. In God&#8217;s recovery, the recovery of the temple is first, and then the recovery of the walls of the city. With the recovery of the walls, the house is fully safeguarded.<p>I would ask you to pray-read all of these verses concerning the saints&#8217; enjoyment of the house and the city of God in Psalms 49 through 67. All their enjoyments are through Christ. The more you pray-read them, the more you will enter into their enjoyment.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST&#8217;S ATTAINMENT IN HIS ASCENSION  FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD&#8217;S HOUSE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalm 68</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 68:1, 4-6, 9-13, 15-32, 35</h1><p>Now we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, Psalm 68.<p>When I was a young Christian, I was always afraid to come to this Psalm, because I simply could not comprehend its meaning. Immediately after I was saved, I was encouraged to memorize Psalm 1. It was very easy for me to understand this one. After a number of years in the Word of God, I learned to summarize passages and divide the Word into paragraphs and sections. That came easily. But when I encountered Psalm 68, I could not summarize it, neither could I divide it into sections. Most of the time I passed over it and neglected it. It was too difficult for me. Nevertheless, though I neglected it, the Lord could not forget it. Praise the Lord, now we are in Psalm 68. I have always been so happy in recent months to stay in this Psalm. I am not afraid of it anymore. I love Psalm 68. I would testify that today I am on top of this Psalm, I am on the peak.<p>We will see that in this Psalm we have firstly Christ, secondly the house, thirdly the city, Jerusalem, and fourthly the earth. But we do not have the law. The law has been left behind; the law has been dropped. When we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, we only have Christ in the house within the city for the whole earth. These are the four key words of Psalm 68-Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. If we would understand this Psalm, and indeed all the Psalms, we must understand these four words. The whole book of the Psalms is found in miniature in Psalm 68. By now we have already laid the foundation for this Psalm. Before we have come to the peak, we have already glimpsed it. We have seen Christ, we have seen the house, we have seen the city, and we have seen the earth. We have such a foundation. Now it is easy for us to understand Psalm 68.<p>We may briefly define this Psalm by saying that it tells us how, in God&#8217;s move on the earth, Christ ascended to the heavens and as a man received gifts from God for the building of God&#8217;s dwelling place. The building up of God&#8217;s house is for the expansion of the city, and the expansion of the city is for Christ&#8217;s reigning over the entire earth. Christ has conquered all His enemies, He has won the victory, He has led captive a train of vanquished foes, He has ascended and been exalted to the highest place in the universe, and He has received gifts for building up the house of God. This house is for the city, and the city is for the whole earth. Now you have Psalm 68. Without these points, though you may read this Psalm one hundred times, you will never comprehend it. But we must look into these matters in further detail. We may say that this Psalm presents us with nine major points.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S MOVING ON THIS EARTH</h2><p>To properly understand Psalm 68, we must be acquainted with the background of its composition. It is God&#8217;s moving on this earth in His tabernacle. In ancient times God moved on this earth among the people of Israel. He moved with them from Egypt to the wilderness and into the good land. His moving was not in the heavens, but on this earth. He rode through the wilderness, through the desert, not through the skies. All God&#8217;s moving at that time was related to the tabernacle, within which was the ark. The tabernacle in typology signifies God&#8217;s dwelling place, and the ark represents Christ. Hence, God was moving on the earth in and through His dwelling place with Christ as the center. We must be clear concerning these three points: (1) God is moving on the earth, (2) God&#8217;s move was in and with the tabernacle, and (3) God&#8217;s move was with Christ as the center in the tabernacle. Psalm 68 was written with this background. It is an exact portrayal of the situation with God&#8217;s move on the earth today. God is moving on this earth, He is moving in and through His church, and He is moving with Christ as the center of the church.<p>Verse 1 says, &#8220;Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.&#8221; This is a quotation of Numbers 10:35, &#8220;And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.&#8221; Psalm 68:1 was the word spoken by Moses. When God set out to move with the ark, Moses said, &#8220;Rise up, Lord.&#8221; Now Moses&#8217; word is quoted by David: &#8220;Let God arise.&#8221; Hence, we see that the background of this Psalm is the move of God in His tabernacle with the ark.<p>The move of God on this earth is not only the background of Psalm 68, but also the first thought. In addition to verse 1, there are other verses which speak most expressively of God&#8217;s move. Verse 4 in the best translation reads, &#8220;Triumph in him that rideth through the deserts,&#8221; not, as in the King James Version, &#8220;him that rideth upon the heavens.&#8221; He is not riding through the skies, but through the wilderness, through the deserts of this earth. The entire earth today is a desert, a wilderness; yet God is riding through and moving on. Do not be disappointed; triumph in Him, in Him who is riding through the desert. The desert means nothing to Him; He is riding through it. Have you seen this? &#8220;His name is JAH; and exult before him.&#8221; Verses 7 and 8 continue the thought of God&#8217;s move: &#8220;O God...thou wentest forth before thy people...thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah.&#8221; The first point of this Psalm is that God is moving on this earth.<h2 class=head1>II. GOD&#8217;S VICTORY IN CHRIST</h2><p>This Psalm begins with the moving of God and continues with the victory which Christ has gained. All God&#8217;s enemies have been defeated. When God moves with the tabernacle and with the ark, the enemies will always be vanquished. Wherever He goes, He always wins the victory; wherever He moves, He conquers. He has never been defeated.<p>Many times in reading the Old Testament we are impressed only with the failures of God&#8217;s people, the children of Israel. But we must read their history in Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy from a different perspective. We must see that whenever in God&#8217;s move He confronted the enemy, the enemy was defeated. Not once was God ever defeated by His enemies. As long as God&#8217;s people had the tabernacle of God with the ark as its center, they were victorious. They may fail, but God could never be defeated.<p>Have you ever found a single instance in the Bible of God being defeated? God has never been defeated. This is the main concept of this Psalm. God is moving, and with His move is constant victory. Oh, if we are in God&#8217;s house with Christ as the center, we can never be defeated! We may sometimes delay God a little, just as the children of Israel delayed Him for forty years in the wilderness, but what do forty years mean to God? If a thousand years is but one day in God&#8217;s eyes, forty years is only equivalent to about fifty-five minutes. According to divine reckoning, the children of Israel delayed God about fifty-five minutes. Actually, with God there is no concept of time; time is something with which we are concerned. To God, yesterday, today and tomorrow are all the same. In a human sense, God has been delayed many times, but He has never been defeated. To Him, a delay in time means nothing. He is moving on, and wherever He goes He defeats the enemy. Regardless of how poor the situation of the church may be, we should not be distracted. We must look at the glory of God&#8217;s move and His eternal victory. &#8220;Let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him&#8221; (v. 1). &#8220;The Lord sendeth the news of victory...the kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!&#8221; (vv. 11-12). &#8220;The Almighty scattered kings&#8221; (v. 14). &#8220;Thou has led captive a train of vanquished foes&#8221; (v. 18). &#8220;God will smite the head of the enemies&#8221; (v. 21). God&#8217;s victory is the second point of this Psalm.<p>Verse 11: &#8220;The Lord sendeth the news of victory: great is the host of women that publish the tidings.&#8221; We are all just a group of women, a host of females, publishing the good news. We are not so strong and able; we are not, in a sense, the warriors of battle; we are the women publishers. We just publish the good tidings. And what are the good tidings? Verse 12: &#8220;The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!&#8221; These are the glad tidings-the victory of Christ, the defeat of the enemy. I could testify that when I was in the denominations, I was continually sighing, groaning, and begging, &#8220;O Lord, merciful Lord, have mercy on me.&#8221; The meetings of the group with which I met were filled with this kind of cry. I never heard praising or rejoicing. I never heard a song like, &#8220;Victory, victory, hallelujah!&#8221; In these days in the local churches I am forever hearing, &#8220;Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!&#8221; All the enemies flee! They flee! They flee!<p>The publishers of the glad tidings are women, and those who divide the spoil are also women. The women tarry at home; they do not go out to fight. Yet they divide the spoil. I have never gone out to the battle; I am just a woman, abiding at home, enjoying the victory and dividing the spoil. We should all do the same. Praise the Lord, we are qualified, we are entitled to divide the spoil. All the meetings in the local churches are just the dividing of the spoil. What are the spoils? Verse 13 tells us: &#8220;The wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with glittering gold.&#8221; The dove is the Spirit, and the wings are the soaring power; so the spoils are the soaring power of the Spirit. These wings are covered with silver, covered with Christ in His redemption. Her pinions are covered with glittering gold, God&#8217;s divine nature. This is the spoil-the Triune God. We have the Spirit as the dove, Christ the Son as the silver, and God the Father as the gold. All three Persons of the Godhead together constitute the spoil. The spoil is our strength as two wings, not to walk or to run, but to fly and to soar. When you come to the local church and join in the Hallelujahs, you are enjoying the spoil. Eventually, after every meeting, you will have the sense that you are soaring. We do have wings, and we are on the wings of the dove. Our spoil is the Triune God as our soaring strength, and all the spoil issues from the victory of Christ.<h2 class=head1>III. CHRlST&#8217;S ASCENSION</h2><p>The third point in this Psalm is Christ&#8217;s ascension. Verse 18: &#8220;Thou hast ascended on high. Thou hast led captive a train of vanquished foes.&#8221; Without Ephesians 4:8-11 we would not know what verse 18 means. But by this New Testament passage, we see that it refers to the ascension of Christ. Christ has ascended on high, and the implication of His ascension is that all His enemies have been defeated. Before He ascended, He vanquished every foe, including the last enemy, death. He conquered death. From our human point of view, Jesus was put to death by human hands; but from the heavenly viewpoint it was He Himself who walked into death. He simply took a little walk. He walked into death willingly in order to manifest His life power. He stayed there for three days, and He conquered death. Death did all it could to retain Him, but death could not hold its prey (Acts 2:24). He walked into death, and He walked out of death. He walked right through death, and He conquered it. Before dealing with death, He had already conquered everything else. Death was the last enemy. His emergence from death means that every foe, including death itself, has been vanquished. So He ascended triumphantly. And He led a train of vanquished foes. All the enemies defeated by Him were the captives in this train, including Satan, and including you and me. The train is a procession, celebrating His victory. Praise the Lord! Today we can tell Satan that he is defeated and we are defeated too; but, hallelujah, we can also tell him that we are victorious in and with Christ&#8217;s victory, and he can never be victorious. This is a real praise. We must learn to praise the Lord in this way. How pitiful is the praise of many Christians! It is something like this: &#8220;O Lord, we praise Thee that for the entire year we have not had one car accident.&#8221; The praise of others has improved a little, and they say: &#8220;Lord, Thou art the victor over my temper.&#8221; But, brothers and sisters, we must see something much higher than this. Christ has ascended, and He has led captive a train of vanquished foes. You were there, not just your little temper. Forget about having no car accidents, forget about conquering your temper. Hallelujah! Christ has ascended on high! And He has led a train of vanquished foes! While He ascended into the heavens He made such a show, such an exhibition, in His triumphant procession before the entire universe. He has defeated Satan and all the rebellious angels. Satan and his host must flee! And he has defeated all the rebellious people, including you and me. He has led a procession of all these defeated foes as a praise to celebrate His victory. After showing them to the entire universe, He has, in a sense, shown them to His Father and said, &#8220;Look at the enemy and all his followers who were conquered and defeated by Me!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>IV. CHRIST RECEIVING GIFTS</h2><p>Now we have the issue of Christ&#8217;s ascension. It is that many of these defeated foes have been given as gifts by the Father to Christ for His Body. These gifts, which are mentioned in Ephesians 4, are persons, not functions or abilities. &#8220;He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers&#8221;-these are the gifts. Men such as Paul, Peter, and John are the gifts. It is as if, when Christ ascended to the Father with the train of vanquished foes, He said, &#8220;Father, look at these foes defeated by Me.&#8221; Then the Father replied, &#8220;All right, let Me take some of those foes, let Me take Saul of Tarsus, and this one in Los Angeles, and that one in Houston. I will give them to You as gifts for Your Body. They were defeated by You, and now I will give them to You as gifts.&#8221; And He did.<p>Saul of Tarsus is a good example-he was a real foe of Christ. But the ascended and exalted Christ came to visit him one day. He had become exceedingly violent in persecuting Jesus, but when the Lord cast one look upon him he fell to the ground. I do not believe the Ascended One used His hand, but that He merely looked at him. Saul was smitten to the earth, and he heard a voice saying, &#8220;Saul, Saul, what are you doing? Why are you persecuting Me?&#8221; Saul replied, &#8220;Lord, who are You? I have been persecuting people on this earth; I have never persecuted the heavenly Lord.&#8221; The Lord said, &#8220;I am Jesus. You thought you were persecuting James, John, Peter, and Stephen, but you did not know that you were persecuting Me.&#8221; Do you know what happened? The Ascended One captured Saul. Saul at that moment became a captive. And Saul repented and said, &#8220;Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?&#8221; On that day the resurrected Christ got into him, and this foe, this vanquished foe, became a captive with the resurrected Christ in him as his life. It was through this Resurrected One that this captured foe was made a gift, even one of the greatest apostles. In this way the Lord Jesus received gifts in man. He captures people as the Ascended One, and He regenerates them as the Resurrected One. It is by His resurrection life that He turns the captured foes into useful gifts. It was in this way that the Father, speaking of Paul, said to the Son, &#8220;I give this little one to You as a gift, and You must give this little one to the church as a gift.&#8221; Saul was later called Paul, which means &#8220;the little one.&#8221; Saul became a Paul. The foe of Christ eventually became a gift given by the Father to Christ and given by Christ to His Body.<p>Look at that captive Saul of Tarsus. How changed he was! Read his history; see how he was changing all the time. He was transformed from such a persecuting foe to such a useful apostle. He was a real gift to the Body, and Christ the Head received him as a gift in this way.<p>So many of us can testify of the same experience. Before we were saved, we were the foes of Christ, but one day the Ascended One looked upon us. Many times when I have considered how the Lord captured me and transformed me from a foe to one who serves Him, I fall down and worship. I have nothing to say; all I can do is praise Him. I deserve nothing. Nothing was done by me; everything was done by Him. Oh, hallelujah!<p>The Lord is transforming so many foes into gifts for His Body, and He is doing it that the Lord God might dwell among them. &#8220;Thou hast ascended on high. Thou hast led captive a train of vanquished foes. Thou hast received gifts in man, and even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell with them.&#8221; I think that today we are much more qualified to speak this verse than the Psalmist in ancient times. We are in the Church, the house of God; we are in the dwelling place where God dwells through the ascended Christ. We are the vanquished foes who are being made into gifts for the building of God&#8217;s house. We are in the reality.<h2 class=head1>V. A DWELLING PLACE FOR GOD</h2><p>The first point in this Psalm concerns God&#8217;s move on this earth. The second is His victory in Christ; where God moves, God wins the victory. Following this, the third point, the ascension of Christ, issues in the fourth point, the gifts for the building. Fifthly, a dwelling place is built up for God by the gifts. God moves, God wins the victory in Christ over all the enemies, Christ ascends, Christ receives all the gifts, and then the house of God is built. Praise the Lord, now God has a house to dwell in, a dwelling place on this earth among men, even among the rebellious.<p>This dwelling place is not only a habitation for God, but also for us. In verse 5 we read, &#8220;A father of the fatherless, and a protector of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.&#8221; In ancient times God&#8217;s habitation was the tabernacle, but today His habitation is the church. In one sense, we are all the fatherless; we are the widows. But in the local church God is our God. We enjoy God as the God of the helpless in His dwelling place. Verse 6 says, &#8220;God placeth the solitary in families and giveth the desolate a home to dwell in.&#8221; The local church on one hand is the family and on the other hand is our home. Before you came into the church, you were solitary because you had no family, and you were desolate because you had no home. Now in God&#8217;s dwelling place you have the family with the home. Verse 10: &#8220;Thy flock found a dwelling place in it (in the rain-watered land-v. 9): thou, O God, didst prepare it in thy goodness for the needy.&#8221; God&#8217;s dwelling place is for us, the needy ones.<p>Verses 15 and 16: &#8220;The mighty mountain, Mount Bashan; the many-peaked mountain, Mount Bashan; why do ye look with envy, ye many-peaked mountains, at the mountain which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it forever.&#8221; I believe that this is the best translation of these verses. (The word for God in Hebrew is &#8220;mighty&#8221;; therefore the translators of the King James version called Mount Bashan &#8220;the hill of God.&#8221; But if we translate the Hebrew word &#8220;mighty&#8221; as &#8220;God&#8221; in this verse, it is really difficult to understand. This verse does not mean that.) Mount Bashan is a mighty mountain, a mount in the heathen land east of Jordan. In the translation we have given, the meaning is clear. Mount Zion is the mount which God desires to dwell in, and the other mountains, or rather the many-peaked mountain, looks upon the mountain of God with envy. We have experienced this. Some of the denominations, the many-peaked mountain, are envious of the local churches. Many times they would say, &#8220;Why do the local churches get the blessing?&#8221; It is because God dwells in Zion-that is the only reason. God desires to dwell in the local churches, and all the blessing comes from His presence. Yea, the Lord will dwell here forever. He has a dwelling place here on this earth in the local churches! &#8220;The chariots of God are twenty thousands, even thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary&#8221; (v. 17). Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>VI. THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</h2><p>After God&#8217;s dwelling place is built, we have the enjoyment in God&#8217;s house of all that God is, all that God does, and all that God can do. This is the sixth point in this Psalm. After verse 18 concerning God&#8217;s dwelling, we have such rich enjoyment in verses 19 and 20: &#8220;Blessed be the Lord: day by day doth he load us with good, the God who is our salvation. Selah. God is unto us a God of deliverances; and with God, the Lord, are the goings forth even from death.&#8221; In the house, in the church, in the sanctuary, God loads us with good day by day; hence we enjoy His goods; we enjoy His salvation, His deliverances, and His goings forth even from death. The going forth from death is a real deliverance. If we could go forth from death, we could go forth from the enemy. Everyone knows that whenever death comes to visit, there is no escape. This is really so. But we Christians may say today that whenever we are confronted with death, we can go forth from death. What a deliverance! We enjoy God; we experience God as our deliverance, as our going forth from death.<p>Moreover, in the house of God we enjoy His glorious victory. &#8220;But God will smite the head of the enemies...The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring (thine enemies) again from the depth of the (Red) sea, that thou mayest crush them, dipping thy foot in the blood, and the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from (thine) enemies&#8221; (vv. 21-23). God has defeated all His enemies: Bashan has been defeated by Him, the Egyptians have been drowned by Him in the Red Sea. All His foes are vanquished. Today, there is no need for Him to repeat His victory. Today, in the local churches, in the sanctuary, we may apply His victory. In these three verses it is as if the Lord had said, &#8220;If you do not believe that all My enemies have been defeated, I will demonstrate My victory to you. I will bring Pharaoh and his hosts from the depths of the Red Sea and demonstrate their defeat again.&#8221; Before the house was built up, it was time for the Lord to defeat His enemies. But since the house has been built, there is no need for the Lord to repeat His victory. We only need to apply His victory.<p>After I was saved, I heard many messages and read many books which told how to be a victorious Christian. These messages and books indicated that I had many enemies: the world is my enemy; my self is my enemy; my temper, my hatred, and all my problems are my enemies. Then these messages and books indicated many wonderful ways to overcome these enemies. Some said that I must pray much; others said that I must pray with fasting; still others exhorted me to pray with fasting and without sleep. But none of these ways worked. Then I was told that Christ was crucified on the cross, and all the enemies including myself were crucified there too; now I must reckon upon this. I tell you, I tried to reckon for a long time, but I never succeeded. I filled many notebooks with these ways and methods of being an overcoming Christian. One day I threw them all away. There were so many good instructions, concepts, teachings, and suggestions, and I greatly appreciated them. But one day I began to realize that by coming into the local church and staying in the local church, every problem is solved and every enemy is overcome. It was so wonderful; I cannot tell you how wonderful it was! When I stayed in the local church, the world was gone, my temper was gone, and my problems disappeared. I am speaking from actual experience; I have been learning this for over thirty years. I have tried many methods and ways. I searched the Bible to find the will of God. Eventually that did not work, and I found nothing. But when I came into the local church and stayed there, the will of God was spontaneously made clear. I tried to solve my problems as an individual again and again, but could never overcome. When I stayed in the local church, however, all the enemies fled. I had no intention of defeating them; they all fled. From my experience I can boldly testify and declare that the best way to solve your problems, to overcome your enemies, to know the Lord&#8217;s will, and to obtain the Lord&#8217;s blessing is simply to stay in the local church and praise the Lord. Just do it. Just try it. This one kind of medicine heals all kinds of diseases.<p>In the early years of my ministry I had many points to pass on to others. A sister came to me thirty-five years ago and asked how she could overcome her temper. I replied, &#8220;Sister, firstly, you must do this; secondly, you must do that; thirdly...fourthly...fifthly...sixthly...until there were twelve points. Go home and practice all these twelve points, and you will overcome your temper.&#8221; It was a hard job! About ten years later, others came with the same question. The number of points was then reduced to about six. Then after a few years, the points were reduced further to three. Today, I will give you not twelve points, not six, not three, but only one: just come into the local church, stay in the local church, and praise the Lord. All your problems will be solved spontaneously. Believe me.<p>I cannot tell you what kind of revelation this is to me. I would tell the entire universe that I have the secret. It is so prevailingly, tremendously effective. Come to the local church and praise the Lord. Hallelujah, hallelujah! For all your problems, the best way to pray to the Lord is to come to the local church and praise the Lord. In God&#8217;s dwelling place, in the local church, the Lord does not supply us little by little. He loads us with good; He applies His victory over all our enemies.<p>In the years 1939 and 1940 Brother Watchman Nee saw the Body of Christ with great clarity. I have mentioned how he released some messages on this matter, telling us definitely that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a matter of the Body. If you as an individual attempt to defeat the enemy, you will to a great extent be defeated by him. You must realize that the battle has already been won. There is no need for you to fight it. If you simply place yourself in the Body in a practical way and remain in the Body, the victory is yours.<p>We were raised up by the Lord in 1920. Before 1940, we never had a large number for baptism. There may have been thirty-seven or thirty-eight at one baptism-that was all. The number was always small, because before 1940 we always preached the Gospel in an individual way. The Lord had not yet revealed the way of preaching the Gospel as a church, the whole church preaching together. In 1940 we began, and in January we had more than one hundred baptized at once. In February another hundred were baptized, and in March another hundred. We had seen that the effective way to preach the Gospel was not as individuals, but as the church. If you attempt to convince your friends as an individual, it is rather difficult; but if you ask some brothers to help you bring your unbelieving friend to the gathering, there will be no need for you to preach. He will be saved-you will see. When you bring all the problems to the church, they are spontaneously solved. Do not keep your friends in your hands in an individual way; bring them into the church. In the church God loads us with good; in the church He applies His victory.<p>Are you sorrowful? Then what should you do? Yes, come to the church meetings. Do not attempt to encourage yourself and overcome your problems. Bring all your sorrows to the local church, and tell the enemy Satan to go with you to the meeting. If your wife is angry, just tell her, &#8220;Dear, let us go to the church.&#8221; Don&#8217;t try to solve your problems in your home and then come to the church. You will be frustrated. Tell all the enemies and all the problems, &#8220;Come with me to the meeting.&#8221; I have had many experiences like this. As soon as I have come into the entrance of the meeting hall, the enemies and problems have fled. They followed me to the meeting, but when I entered the meeting, they turned and left. I have learned how to save much time in reading books. Coming to one meeting is better than reading ten books. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>VII. PRAISE</h2><p>Now we are ready to praise. Now it is our turn. We enjoy all that God is, all that God does and all that He can do; so we just praise Him. We have nothing to do today but praise Him: &#8220;Hallelujah for the enjoyment! Hallelujah for God loading us with good, for the victory and for the application of the victory.&#8221; We have brought all the problems to the meetings, and they have disappeared; so we just praise. &#8220;They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary&#8221; (v. 24). Who has seen His goings? They, the enemies, the problems. They have seen His goings in the sanctuary. This is real praise. Sometimes I have actually praised the Lord in this way, &#8220;Lord, all my enemies have followed me to the entrance of the meeting hall, and when I came in they all ran away. They have seen Thy goings in the local church.&#8221;<p>Verse 25: &#8220;The singers went before, the players on stringed instruments after, in the midst of maidens playing on timbrels.&#8221; This is poetry, and it tells us that all the singers and players are women. The women publish the glad tidings of victory; the women tarry at home and divide the spoil; and now the women praise. Unless you are a woman, you cannot praise. But, spiritually speaking, we are all women. There is no need for us to fight. The fighting is not ours, but His. We are the enjoying and praising women. In the entire universe there is just one man-that is Christ. He is the One who works; He is the One who fights, and who has already won the battle; He is the One who does everything. We are simply those who enjoy His victory, those who praise. Fighting is not our business; praising is our business. We are the singers, we are the players, we are the praisers. Have you seen this? To understand these verses we must take them in a poetic way.<p>Now we come to the main part of the praise in this Psalm: &#8220;Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, ye that are of (Jacob) the fountain of Israel. There is little Benjamin in the lead, the princes of Judah with their company, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali&#8221; (vv. 26-27). It is indeed interesting. There are twelve tribes altogether among the children of Israel, but only four are mentioned here. Why these four? In the Bible, Benjamin and Judah always go together; likewise, Zebulun and Naphtali are put together, especially in Matthew 4. The choice of these four tribes in this verse is full of significance.<p> Benjamin signifies Christ as the man of sorrows, who has become the man at the right hand. His name Benoni, which means the son of sorrow, speaks of His incarnation and His human life on this earth, and His name Benjamin, which means the son of the right hand (Gen. 35:18), refers to His resurrection, His victory, and His ascension. Christ was the little Benjamin. Benjamin was the youngest and smallest of the twelve tribes, but the tribe of Benjamin was exceedingly strong and bold in fighting (Gen. 49:27). Benjamin is a warrior tribe, and this tribe always goes together with the kingly tribe, Judah. Judah signifies Christ as the victor, the lion, with the power and the scepter; and the One who will return as the King of peace, that is, as Shiloh (Gen. 49:8-10). Both Benjamin and Judah represent Christ: from His incarnation to His ascension, He is Benjamin; from His reigning with divine authority to His return as the King of peace, He is Judah. By incarnation, Christ became the son of sorrow; He fought the battle, devoured the foes, divided the spoils, and gained the victory (Gen. 49:27). Then He ascended to the heavens and became the Son of the right hand of God. He has the scepter, the authority, and now all His brethren praise Him. He is worthy! From Genesis 49 we must go to Revelation 5, where we see the lion of the tribe of Judah, the One who is worthy of our worship, our praises. He is the victor, He has the power and the authority, He will come back as the peaceful One, and we, His brethren, will worship and praise Him. This is our Christ, represented by Benjamin and Judah.<p>This Christ is also Zebulun and Naphtali. These two tribes signify a haven of ships, a hind let loose. They speak of beautiful words being given and preached, and of the men of Galilee (Gen. 49:13, 21; Matt. 4:12-17; Acts 1:11). The haven of ships is for transportation, and it signifies the Christ who is being spread throughout the entire earth. The hind let loose is one who is released, one who runs with speed. Beautiful words are the praises, the preaching, and the propagation of Christ. This is what occupied the men of Galilee. Christ is the real Zebulun and the real Naphtali. He is being spread, praised, and preached all over the earth today. He is a hind let loose.<p>The first two names, Benjamin and Judah, signify what Christ is: He was the son of sorrow, who died on the cross, won the victory, ascended, devoured the prey, divided the spoil, and is now the Son of the right hand of God; He is also the lion, the victor, the One who has authority over all things, and who will come back as the peaceful One. The last two names, Zebulun and Naphtali, signify the Christ who is being spread and propagated all over the earth. When we praise the Lord, we must praise Him for all He is, and we must also praise Him for His spreading throughout the earth. He is little Benjamin with Judah, and He is Zebulun with Naphtali. We have to praise Him in this way.<h2 class=head1>VIII. THE CITY</h2><p>Next we need to pray that God will strengthen that which He has wrought for us out of the church. &#8220;Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us out of thy temple&#8221; (vv. 28-29). God has wrought everything and all has been accomplished; what we need today is the strengthening. God has put Satan to death already. We do not need God to repeat this act, but we do need Him to strengthen us. God has put our self, our old man, on the cross already-God has wrought this, and He need not re-enact it. However, we do need God to strengthen this experience within us. The Bible tells us that we have ascended with Christ to the heavens-God has wrought this already. Today what we need is the strengthening of this experience within us. This strengthening is in the temple. It is in the local church that God does everything to strengthen what He has wrought for us. We must pray, &#8220;O God, strengthen what You have wrought for us out of Your temple!&#8221; We do not need a repetition, but we do need a strengthening. We need God to make all that He has wrought for us so real to us, out of His church, out of His dwelling place.<p>I cannot tell you how much strengthening of God I have enjoyed since being in the local church. In the house of God there is the strengthening of God Himself. We must stand upon this verse. God has wrought everything for us, and now He would strengthen all that He has wrought for us out of His house.<p>Then in verse 29 we read, &#8220;Unto Jerusalem (or, thy temple at Jerusalem) shall kings bring presents unto thee.&#8221; Now we encounter not only the temple, but also Jerusalem; not only the house, but also the city. We must understand this in a poetic way. When we experience the strengthening of God in the local church, the church is transformed from a house to a city. The temple becomes Jerusalem. The house is surrounded, protected, and safeguarded by the walls of the city. Then, because we are so victorious, so overcoming, so transcendent, we have the sense that all the kings of the earth shall bring presents to the Lord. Revelation 21:24 corroborates this word: &#8220;The kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it (the city).&#8221; I wish to add a further word here in the way of interpretation: If you are so victorious in the local churches, many presents will be brought in through you. What presents? Many souls, many persons, who will be released and brought by you into the local churches as presents to the Lord.<p>Verses 29 and 30: &#8220;From thy temple at Jerusalem, where kings shall bring presents to thee, rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds (in Egypt), the herd of bulls (the leaders), with the calves of the people; trample under foot those who lust for tribute money; scatter the peoples who delight in war.&#8221; From the house in the city, God rebukes the enemy. There is no need for God to fight the battle any longer; He simply rebukes His foes. He does it from the temple in the city, from the local church safeguarded by His strengthening. When God has a church which is not only a temple or a house, but also a city, a kingdom with His authority and majesty, He is able to rebuke His enemies and subdue all the nations. The local church as a city is the stepping-stone for the Lord to recover the entire earth.<h2 class=head1>IX. THE EARTH</h2><p>Verses 31 and 32: &#8220;Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God. Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah.&#8221; These two verses indicate how the whole earth will be gained by the Lord. Through the city the Lord recovers the earth. &#8220;O God, thou art awe-inspiring out of thy sanctuaries (today we may say that He is awe-inspiring out of the local churches); the God...is he who giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God&#8221; (v. 35).<p>These are the nine main points of Psalm 68: God&#8217;s move on this earth, His victory in Christ over all His enemies, Christ&#8217;s ascension after His victory, Christ&#8217;s receiving and giving of gifts, the building up of the house of God by the gifts, the enjoyment of God in the house as everything to us, loading us with good and applying His victory over all situations, our praises issuing from our enjoyment, the enlarging of the church from the house to the city, and eventually the recovery of the earth through the city. It is marvelous! This is the climax of all the Psalms.<p class=hbody>God shall rise, His foes be scattered,<br>All that hate Him flee away.<br>As the wax before the fire,<br>All the wicked He shall slay.<br>But the righteous shall rejoice<br>With a loud, triumphant voice,<br>Singing praises, singing praises,<br>Singing praises unto God!</p><p class=hbody>He is riding through the deserts,<br>Bringing in His saints in need.<br>He&#8217;s a Father to the orphans<br>And a refuge tried indeed<br>In His holy habitation-<br>What a wonderful salvation!<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>Here the lone have found a family,<br>Here the desolate a home;<br>Prisoners are brought from bondage<br>To prosperity unknown.<br>For the flock-what wondrous grace-<br>God prepared this dwelling place:<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>Now the Lord in mighty triumph<br>Sends the news of victory;<br>We the &#8220;women&#8221; spread the tidings-<br>&#8220;Kings of armies flee, they flee!&#8221;<br>No more sweat and dreary toil;<br>We at home divide the spoil!<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>Lo, on high Christ hath ascended,<br>Leading captives in His train;<br>These as gifts He has perfected<br>That the Lord may dwell with them.<br>Brothers, sisters, we are those,<br>We&#8217;re those transformed, vanquished foes!<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>Blessed be the Lord forever:<br>Day by day He loads with good,<br>E&#8217;en the God of our salvation-<br>Spread His worthy praise abroad.<br>His the goings forth from death,<br>Every foe He conquereth!<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>They have seen, O God, Thy goings<br>In Thy holy dwelling place,<br>Thy triumphal, high processions<br>Midst a mighty voice of praise.<br>See the singers go before,<br>Praising, praising o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er:<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>Little Benjamin is leading,<br>Then great Judah&#8217;s company:<br>Son of sorrow at God&#8217;s right hand,<br>Lion with the scepter see.<br>Zebulun and Naphtali<br>Make the joyful tidings fly:<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>Saints, thy strength has been commanded<br>From the temple glorious;<br>Still we pray that God may strengthen<br>All that He has wrought for us.<br>Higher yet our praise shall rise<br>Till the utmost earth replies:<br>Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br>Hallelujah, Amen!</p><p class=hbody>(Hymns, #1100)</p><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REIGN OF THE SUFFERING CHRIST  OVER ALL THE EARTH</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 69 to 72</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 69:9, 35-36; 72:6-11, 15-19</h1><p>Psalm 72 is the last Psalm of Book II, and it ends in this way: &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.&#8221; Psalm 41 closes the first book of the Psalms, and its last verse says, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.&#8221; By comparing the closing verses of Book I and Book II, we see the improvement. The conclusion of Book I is not so definite and strong as that of Book II. In Book II something is added: it still says, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,&#8221; but it adds, &#8220;who only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever.&#8221; Then the Psalmist proceeds to speak something of the earth. We have read in Psalm 8, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.&#8221; Psalm 8 is not fulfilled in Book I, but in Book II. Therefore, at the end of Book II, the Psalmist exclaims, &#8220;Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.&#8221;<p>Have you seen the improvement? In Book I we have mainly Christ with the house and just a hint of the city-that is all. But when we come to the second book, we have Psalms 46, 47, 48, and 68, in which we reach the climax of the city, and we see that the city is for the entire earth. Hence, at the conclusion of Book II, we find such a marked improvement.<p>When we reach the end of Psalm 68, everything has been accomplished. Christ has ascended on high, He has received all the gifts for the building up of God&#8217;s house, and the house is built and enlarged to the city for the recovery of the entire earth. We may feel there is no need of any additional Psalms. But we must realize the style in which the Psalms are written. They always cover certain matters, repeat, and then add a little more later on. Something is mentioned in Book I, and then something more in Book II, until we reach Psalm 68, the peak of all the peaks. But following Psalm 68, something is still repeated and something is added.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST EXPRESSED IN HIS SUFFERING</h2><p>In Psalms 69 to 71 we mainly see the sufferings of Christ and how He behaves and expresses Himself in all His sufferings. Let us note His sufferings as mentioned in Psalm 69 with the New Testament references concerning their fulfillment: (1) He was hated by many without a cause-Psalm 69:4, cf. John 15:25; (2) He bore reproaches for God&#8217;s sake-Psalm 69:7, 9, cf. Rom. 15:3; (3) The zeal of God&#8217;s house has eaten Him up-Psalm 69:9, cf. John 2:17. While Christ was suffering, the zeal of God&#8217;s house consumed Him. His suffering could not cause Him to forget the house of God. He was one hundred percent for God&#8217;s house, for He came to this earth with the express purpose of building it up. (4) He suffered much, and no one took pity upon Him-Psalm 69:29, 19-20, cf. John 16:32; (5) He wept and entreated God to deliver Him out of the waters of death-Psalm 69:10, 13-17, 1-2, cf. Heb. 5:7; (6) He asked God to set Him up on high-Psalm 69:29, cf. Acts 2:32-33; (7) He promised God that He would praise Him-Psalm 69:30-34, cf. Heb. 2:12; (8) While He suffered on the cross, He was given gall as His food-Psalm 69:21, cf. Matt. 27:34; (9) In His thirst on the cross He was given vinegar to drink-Psalm 69:21, cf. John 19:28-30; (10) He was smitten and wounded by God-Psalm 69:26, cf. Isa. 53:10. He was not only persecuted and crucified by man, but, because He suffered in our stead, He was smitten and wounded by God. (11) His suffering was for the salvation of Zion and the building of the cities of God&#8217;s people-Psalm 69:35-36, cf. Eph. 5:25b. His suffering was for God&#8217;s house, for the local church, for all God&#8217;s people. In other words, He suffered that God&#8217;s people might have a dwelling place on this earth. (12) His betrayer&#8217;s habitation will become desolate-Psalm 69:25, cf. Acts 1:20.<p>Psalm 70, briefly, is the desire uttered by the Spirit of the suffering Christ in the expression of the suffering saint. Psalm 71 is also the utterance of Christ in His suffering in the suffering saint&#8217;s expression.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 72-CHRIST GAINS THE EARTH BY WATERING</h2><p>Now we come to the last Psalm of Book II, Psalm 72. The Psalms are like a great mountain with many peaks, and here we have another peak. Psalm 72 tells us how Christ shall reign over the whole earth and how the saints shall be glorified and blessed with Him. Firstly we see that He will reign with righteousness and justice, by which peace will be ushered in (vv. 1-5). When Christ returns, He will be the King, ruling over the entire earth with righteousness and justice. Hence, the earth will be full of peace. People today speak much about peace, but there will be no peace until Christ returns. Under His rule, real peace will begin its reign. &#8220;He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people&#8221; (vv. 2-3).<p>Secondly, this Psalm presents Christ in His rule like rain watering the earth; so the saints shall flourish. &#8220;He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him&#8221; (vv. 6-11). Even at the time when Christ returns for judgment, He will be like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth. This is the way Christ gains the earth! He gains it by His watering, not by fighting, not by condemning, not by judging. Praise the Lord!<p>&#8220;He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.&#8221; This river is the same as the one mentioned in Psalm 46: &#8220;There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.&#8221; It is really meaningful. That river signifies the flowing out of the Triune God. This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s kingdom and reign is spread to the ends of the earth by the flowing of the Triune God. His dominion is by Himself as the watering river, and He gains the dominion by watering. Whether you say watering or flowing, rain or the river, they are the same. The rain is the river, and the watering is the flowing. The Lord will recover the entire earth, not by examining, not by judging, not by smiting, but by watering! Undoubtedly the Lord Jesus will return to exercise His righteous judgment upon this earth. But that is only one aspect of His return. The other is that He will come back as the rain to water the earth.<p>Today the entire earth is as a dry and barren wilderness. Many evil and sinful things spring forth from this drought and dryness. Men are sinful because they are disappointed and dissatisfied. If you merely judge them, smite them, and condemn them, the problem will not be solved. Of course, the Lord Jesus in His righteousness must exercise His judgment upon all sinful things; but this is not the main aspect of His return. The primary feature is that He will come down as showers to water the dry and thirsty land. He will have pity on this earth, and thus His dominion will not be by judging and smiting, but by watering. Such a Christ will have dominion from sea to sea and will flow as a river to the ends of the earth. Where the flow is, there also is the dominion of the Lord Jesus. In that day all people-black and white, yellow and red-will be rained upon. They will be so happy under Christ&#8217;s dominion. O the watering, O the satisfaction, O the peace, O the security when Christ returns! The Lord Jesus will return to satisfy people. He will be the King, not by exercising power to subdue others, but by supplying living water to satisfy the thirsty. All will be satisfied by His living water. Hallelujah! He will reign from the river to the ends of the earth! He shall have dominion over the whole earth.<p>When I was a young Christian, I was given much teaching concerning the second coming of Christ. All these teachings set forth Christ as a judge. I was taught that He would blast and smite the people in His anger. Never did I hear a message saying that the Lord Jesus would come back so graciously as showers of rain to water the barren land and satisfy the depressed and empty people. But from the Psalms I have assurance to say that, while in one sense He will come back to judge, yet even in His judging the earth will be watered. The river will be there. He will come to possess the earth not only by exercising power, but by the flowing of the Triune God. He will take the earth by means of that river, the river which flows from Jerusalem. Jerusalem in that day will be the center of the earth, and in the center of Jerusalem will be the house, from which the river flows. I believe that this river will reach all the earth in four directions, as in Genesis 2. His dominion will be from the river unto the ends of the earth-not just by power, but by watering. Praise the Lord!<p>In that day all the nations shall worship and serve Him (vv. 8-11). He shall deliver the needy and have compassion on the poor, and deceit and violence shall vanish away (vv. 12-14). These evil things will disappear, not by being judged, but by being watered, by being satisfied. People steal because they are not satisfied. But when the Lord Jesus returns, all will be satisfied; so there will be no more deceit and violence. They will vanish by the Lord&#8217;s satisfying riches.<p>He shall live forever, the earth shall be restored because of Him, and men shall be blessed in Him and bless Him (vv. 15-17). Do you still remember how Psalm 1 begins? It says, &#8220;Blessed is the man....&#8221; But here it says, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord....&#8221; This is a real improvement. God&#8217;s name is blessed forever, and His glory is manifested in the whole earth (vv. 18-19).<p>Psalm 72 gives a glorious picture of what it will be like for the Lord to recover, possess, and reign over the earth. &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.&#8221;<p>There is no &#8220;Amen&#8221; in Psalm 1. But here we have &#8220;Amen, and Amen.&#8221; Praise the Lord for such an improvement. Praise Him that we may now be in the house within the city in anticipation of that soon coming day when the Lord will take the earth in such a way.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DESOLATION OF GOD&#8217;S HOUSE  AND CHRIST AS THE SOLUTION</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 73 to 76</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 73:1-3, 12-17, 25-26; 74:2-3, 7-8; 75:2, 4-7; 76:2-4</h1><p>Now with Psalm 73 we begin Book III of the Psalms. Book III indicates how the saints, in their experiences, realize that the house and the city of God with all the enjoyments thereof can only be preserved and maintained through Christ properly appreciated and exalted by God&#8217;s people. This means that if we would have a consistent experience of the house and the city of God with all their enjoyment, we must appreciate Christ and know Christ in a proper way. Only when we exalt Christ adequately and properly will the enjoyment of God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s city be preserved and maintained. Otherwise, we will lose the enjoyment of the house, and the city of God will vanish. By keeping this in mind, we may realize how Book III is a further improvement in the progression of the Psalms.<h2 class=head1>DESOLATION THREATENS</h2><p>By the end of Book II we have reached the climax, the highest peak. But such a glorious situation, such victory, such ascension, and such wealth of blessing does not often last long. Because we are lacking in our appreciation of the exaltation of Christ, there is a real problem associated with our enjoyment of the house and city of God. God would even allow the enemy to intrude and destroy the enjoyment of His house and city. This is exactly why we have Book III.<p>Some may think that all 150 Psalms are just individual, unrelated pieces. That is not true. Not only are all the Psalms related one to another, but there is a marvelous sequence in the progression of the books into which the Psalms are divided. Why is Book III not in the position of Book I? And why is Book I in the first position, followed by Book II and then Book III? In Books I and II the house is built gradually, step by step, to the highest level. Book I is the beginning; then Book II brings what was begun in Book I to a conclusion, even to the highest level. Now, in Book III, we find mainly the desolation and even the destruction of the house of God. Something which has been built up, something which has already existed and become so wonderful, has been brought to desolation and destruction. This is a strong proof that this Book must be in the third position. Book III could never take the place of Book I, for without the building already established, there could be no desolation.<p>There is always the problem of maintaining and preserving any good situation. It is not so easy to perpetuate such a condition for any length of time. When we reach the highest peak in the local churches, we usually do not stay on the mountaintop very long. Too often some kind of desolation intervenes and brings us down. Bear this in mind.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 73-SUFFERINGS OF THE SEEKING SAINTS</h2><p>As we turn to Psalm 73, we must recall again Psalm 1. I know that by now you are very well acquainted with our case concerning Psalm 1, but allow me to expose it again in the light of Psalm 73. Psalm 1:1 says, &#8220;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.&#8221; And verse 3: &#8220;And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season...and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&#8221; According to Psalm 1, it is not the wicked and the ungodly who will prosper, but the godly saints, those who keep the law. Now turn to Psalm 73, verse 3: &#8220;For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.&#8221; Psalm 1 says that the godly will prosper and the wicked will perish. But Psalm 73 tells us that the Psalmist saw the prosperity of the wicked. In verse 12 he says, &#8220;Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.&#8221; Therefore, Psalm 73 proves conclusively that there is a problem with Psalm 1. He says, &#8220;Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency&#8221; (v. 13). In other words, he is saying, &#8220;I have kept the law all the time; I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in vain, because I did not prosper.&#8221; Verse 14 reveals the experience of this godly saint: &#8220;For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.&#8221; What can we say? Here is a godly saint who is plagued all the day and chastened every morning. We must be exceedingly clear now concerning the position of Psalm 1.<p>Then he continues by saying, &#8220;If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children&#8221; (v. 15). The Psalmist was really perplexed when he considered the situation from the standpoint of material blessing and profit, good and evil; he had a real problem. If he would utter publicly, &#8220;I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency,&#8221; he would not be faithful to God&#8217;s children. What should he do, and what should he say? The Psalmist replies, &#8220;When I thought how I might know this, it was a painful labor in mine eyes&#8221; (v. 16). The whole dilemma was entirely too difficult for him. How could you reconcile Psalm 1 and Psalm 73? According to the traditional teachings of Christianity today, there is absolutely no way to reconcile these two Psalms. This is a strong case set forth to expose the present pitiful situation of Christianity&#8217;s teachings.<p>There is only one way to reconcile Psalms 1 and 73, and it is presented to us in Psalm 73:17, &#8220;Until I went into the sanctuary of God, then understood I their end.&#8221; The sanctuary of God is the place where we may obtain the revelation we need. The sanctuary here undoubtedly signifies the dwelling place of God. Our spirit today is God&#8217;s dwelling place. And, even more, the local churches are God&#8217;s dwelling place. Hence, we must turn to our spirit, and we must turn to the local church; then we will be clear. Our spirit and the local church are the places where we receive divine revelation, where we obtain the explanation to all our problems. When &#8220;I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I....&#8221;<p>What did he understand? Verse 25: &#8220;Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.&#8221; He realized that God was working to deprive him of all material things that he might enjoy God in such an absolute way. This is the revelation. Why do the wicked prosper and their riches continually increase? It is because God has given them up; He simply lets them go on their own way. They have nothing whatever to do with the enjoyment of God. But God&#8217;s intention with the seeking saints is to remove all material blessings and all physical enjoyments that they may find everything in God. Nothing in heaven nor on earth can be their enjoyment but God Himself. It was by the Psalmist&#8217;s experience, as recorded in the first part of Psalm 73, that he could eventually assert, &#8220;Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.&#8221; He received revelation. He learned why God would not allow the seeking saints to prosper as the worldlings do. God intends that nothing should distract us from the absolute enjoyment of Himself. Eventually, it is not a matter of merely keeping the law, but of seeking God absolutely. It is not a matter of doing good or evil, right or wrong-if you are concerned about that, you are still occupied with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It is a matter of seeking God, obtaining God, possessing God. It is a matter of experiencing God to the extent that you also can say, &#8220;Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;I do not care for anything but the tree of life; I do not care for anything other than God Himself.&#8221; This is Psalm 73. When the Psalmist went into the sanctuary of God, he received this revelation and took God Himself as his all. How may we too have the experience of the Psalmist in these verses? We must be in the spirit and in the local church, the sanctuary of God. Just by this one Psalm we may see the difference between Book III and Book I. There is a great improvement. It is not a matter of keeping the law or of being right or wrong, but of having God and of keeping God as everything.<p>Let us look briefly at Psalm 24 in the light of Psalm 73. Psalm 24:1 says, &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s,&#8221; and verse 3 asks, &#8220;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?&#8221; Verse 4 answers: &#8220;He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.&#8221; Some may think that this verse refers to those who keep the law. But if we read Psalm 73, we have these very matters mentioned: &#8220;I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency&#8221; (v. 13). Vanity is anything beside God. Idols are vanity; worldly prosperity is vanity; anything but God is vanity. A pure heart is one that is set on nothing but God. Only one who has a pure heart can say, &#8220;Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.&#8221; If you are still seeking anything other than God, your heart is set upon vanity. God Himself is the reality. Do not imagine that Psalm 24:4 signifies the keeping of the law. Not at all. It refers to one whose heart is set upon nothing but God. The one in Psalm 24:4 is the one in Psalm 73. This is the one who has washed his hands and cleansed his heart. He has a pure heart. Psalm 73:1 says, &#8220;Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a pure heart.&#8221; Psalm 24:4 refers not to the law-keepers, but to the God-seekers. &#8220;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?&#8221; The God-seekers!<p>The way to see all these things is to enter into the sanctuary of God. So many of us can testify that before we came into the local churches, we were ignorant of many things. It was not until we came into the sanctuary of God that we understood.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 74-THE DESOLATION OF THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2><p>Now we must go on from Psalm 73 to Psalm 74. In Psalm 73 we had the sufferings and deprivations of the saints themselves. In Psalm 74 we have the desolations not of the saints, but of God&#8217;s dwelling place. To so many God-seekers, their personal sufferings mean very little, but the desolation of God&#8217;s dwelling place affects them greatly. The Psalmist is troubled to a certain extent in Psalm 73 by his own personal affliction, but the desolate condition of the house of God in Psalm 74 troubles him more. By reading Psalm 74 we partake of the feeling of hurt suffered by the saints for the desolation of God&#8217;s house. The first part of this Psalm (vv. 1-11) records the Psalmist&#8217;s grief concerning the enemy&#8217;s work of destruction upon God&#8217;s house. The second part (vv. 12-23) is his cry for the recovery of God&#8217;s house.<p>Why does God allow the desolation to His house? The answer is not in this Psalm, nor in the following Psalm. We must go through the entire third book of the Psalms to obtain the answer. It is that Christ did not receive the proper appreciation and adequate exaltation. The saints appreciated the house of God, but to a certain extent they neglected Christ. They paid more attention to God&#8217;s house than to Christ Himself. Since Christ was not properly appreciated nor afforded pre-eminence among the saints, desolation was wrought.<p>Because of this desolation, the Psalmist prayed, &#8220;Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the tribe of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary&#8221; (Psalm 74:2-3). For an extended period of time God allowed His house to lie in desolation. Verses 7 and 8 tell us: &#8220;They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the places of assembly of God in the land.&#8221; What desolation God allowed! Keep these verses in mind. They will help in understanding some of the following Psalms, for the following Psalms are the answer to this. God allowed such desolation in His house because the position due to Christ was surrendered. How careful we must be! The local church is wonderful and indeed glorious, but the enjoyment of the local church can only be maintained and preserved by Christ being properly appreciated and exalted among us. If we concentrate on the local church, but neglect Christ Himself, we are in danger of allowing God&#8217;s house to suffer desolation. Christ must have the proper position in the local church: He must have the pre-eminence. If He is not adequately appreciated and exalted, we will lose the enjoyment of God&#8217;s house. This is a warning lest after reaching the highest level of enjoyment in Book II, we lose this enjoyment and experience the desolation recorded in Book III. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may heed this warning and give Christ His due honor, appreciation, and exaltation.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 75-CHRIST JUDGING THE DESOLATERS</h2><p>Psalm 75 apparently has nothing to do with Psalm 74, but it is in fact the answer to the saints in Psalm 74. In Psalm 74 the Psalmist was troubled by the desolation of God&#8217;s house and cried to God for remedy, for judgment upon the wicked one, the desolater of the house of God. The answer is in Psalm 75: Christ will come in to deal with the situation; He will come to judge the desolater. On the one hand the people of God have not properly appreciated and exalted God&#8217;s Anointed, but on the other hand the desolaters have gone too far; so Christ will intervene and judge. Christ says, &#8220;When I shall reach the set time, I will judge uprightly&#8221; (v. 2). In Psalm 74:10 the Psalmist asks, &#8220;O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?&#8221; The answer is in Psalm 75:2. When the set time arrives, Christ will judge. He has set up the pillars of the earth (v. 3). When the set time comes, He will exercise judgment on the earth for God.<p>In verses 4 through 6 Christ says, &#8220;I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: lift not up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck. For lifting up cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.&#8221; From where then does the lifting up come? From God, from the north. By reading Ezekiel chapter one, we discover that God comes from the north. The north is upward, the south is downward. Whenever we go north, we go upward; whenever we go south, we go downward. God is not in the south, but in the north. Psalm 48:2 tells us that Mount Zion, the city of the great King, is on the sides of the north. Many places in the Bible indicate that God is in the north and comes from the north, the upper part. Lifting up comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south, but from the north, because God is in the north.<p>Verse 7: &#8220;But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.&#8221; This is the answer to the Psalmist in Psalm 74. Christ will come in to deal with the desolation. He will make people know God&#8217;s rights and submit themselves to God&#8217;s rule.<p>I do believe that now, in the day in which we are living, the set time has been reached. The desolation of the church has continued long enough. So many dear saints in past generations have prayed, &#8220;How long, O Lord, how long? When will you come to judge?&#8221; Christ answers them in Psalm 75. He says that when the set time is reached, He will judge the desolaters. He speaks to the foolish ones and tells them that lifting up comes not from them, nor from any other direction, but from the One who is in the north, from God. He will declare His judgment and praise God (vv. 9-10), We must all claim in our prayers today, &#8220;Lord, you must come in now to deal with the desolaters, that the desolation of Thy church might be forever past.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>PSALM 76-THE VICTORY OF GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>Psalm 76 tells us that God&#8217;s dwelling place is where God defeats His enemies. According to the arrangement of all the Psalms, this signifies that the defeat of the enemies of God follows the desolation, just as Psalm 76 follows Psalm 74. This certainly fits today&#8217;s situation. Today, after the desolation of the church, God is defeating His enemies in the local churches.<p>Verses 1 and 2: &#8220;In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.&#8221; Salem means peaceful, perfect and complete. That is where God&#8217;s tabernacle is located. It is marvelous! Zion means a fortress, or safety. Therefore Salem signifies peace, and Zion speaks of the safety of a fortress. Here in God&#8217;s dwelling place we have peace, and here we have safety. Verse 3: &#8220;There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.&#8221; You must underline the word &#8220;there.&#8221; It is in God&#8217;s dwelling place, in the local churches, that God defeats and destroys His enemy and smashes all his instruments of war. Verse 4: &#8220;Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.&#8221; The desolaters of God&#8217;s sanctuary are the mountains of prey, but Zion is more excellent and more glorious than all the desolaters. Do not forget that all these Psalms are written in poetic form; hence, we must understand them in a poetic way.<p>Now let us put all these four Psalms together. In Psalm 73 we see the personal sufferings of the seeking saints, then in Psalm 74, the desolation of the house of God. Psalm 75 speaks of Christ&#8217;s intervening to judge the desolaters, and Psalm 76 declares the victory of God in His dwelling place. Firstly, God strips His seeking saints of material things to a certain extent. Secondly, they have seen the desolation of the house of God. Thirdly, they have come to know God&#8217;s intention that they may enjoy Him in an absolute way and then enjoy the house of God. God&#8217;s house has lain desolate for so long because they failed to give God&#8217;s Anointed the proper and pre-eminent position. Fourthly, at the set time God&#8217;s Anointed will come in to deal with the situation. Fifthly, God&#8217;s victory is in His dwelling place. It is in the church as the city that God defeats all His enemies. We must still come back to the dwelling place of God, to Salem, to Zion. Salem is peace, and Zion is safety; so it is there that we have peace and safety.<p>Altogether, in these four Psalms we see that the enjoyment of the house of God depends entirely upon the position Christ is given among God&#8217;s people.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAY OF RESTORATION- EXALTING CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 77 to 83</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 77:7-13; 78:65-66, 68-69; 79:1; 80:14-15, 17-19; 82:8; 83:2-5, 12, 18</h1><p>In Psalms 77 to 83 we are further impressed with the reason for the desolation of God&#8217;s house and the way of recovery. After the desolation, God&#8217;s dwelling place can only be restored by His people giving the pre-eminence to Christ. When Christ is given His rightful position, God will be able to take possession of the earth through the local churches.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 77-GOD&#8217;S WAY IS IN THE SANCTUARY</h2><p>In Psalm 77, the saints, in the experience of troubles, realize that God&#8217;s way is in the sanctuary. In verses 1 to 9, the saints are perplexed by their troubles. The Psalmist asks, &#8220;Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?&#8221; (vv. 7-8). Then he says, &#8220;This is my infirmity&#8221; (v. 10). To say that the Lord has given us up is our infirmity. &#8220;But I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old&#8221; (vv. 10-11). He still remembers what the Lord did in the past. &#8220;I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings&#8221; (v. 12). Do not look only at the present situation; we must remember what the Lord has done in the past. Verse 13: &#8220;Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?&#8221; By remembering what the Lord has done in the past and by fellowshipping one with another concerning all He has accomplished, the saints realize that the way of God is in His sanctuary; thus, God&#8217;s greatness is also realized by them. The way of all the Lord does is in the sanctuary. It is holy and mysterious. You cannot separate His doings from His sanctuary. Since His doings are mysterious, we must get into the heart, the very center of all the situations to understand them. The heart and the center of all the situations is the sanctuary of God. Do not be troubled by the present; remember what the Lord has done in the past and learn the Lord&#8217;s way-it is in the sanctuary of God, in God&#8217;s dwelling place. If you would find the solution, you must forever come into the sanctuary of God. In Psalm 73, the Psalmist received revelation in the sanctuary; in Psalm 77, he finds the answer also in the sanctuary. Verses 16 to 20 also tell us that God&#8217;s way &#8220;is in the sea, in the great waters.&#8221; This indicates that God&#8217;s way is hidden. But we can know the hidden way of God by being in His sanctuary.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 78-MAN&#8217;S FAILURE AND GOD&#8217;S RESTORATION</h2><p>Psalm 78 tells how God built His sanctuary among His people, in spite of their dishonesty, unfaithfulness, instability and failures. The first section, verses 1 to 58, which is the main part of this Psalm, tells how the people failed God. Verses 59 to 64 record how God forsook the people and even His tabernacle among them. &#8220;He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men&#8221; (v. 60). This tabernacle was God&#8217;s dwelling place before the temple was built. &#8220;He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance&#8221; (v. 62). Then verses 65 to 72 tell us how God restored the people and built His sanctuary among them in a better way. &#8220;Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach&#8221; (vv. 65-66). The Lord had abandoned the tabernacle, His dwelling place, as though He were sleeping; but now the Lord awoke as One out of sleep. &#8220;(He) chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever&#8221; (vv. 68-69). This indicates that sometimes, whether we are faithful or not, the Lord will still do something to accomplish His own purpose. The Lord chose a place and built up His sanctuary, exalted as high as the heights of the heavens and stable as the earth.<p>Verses 70 to 72 say that in God&#8217;s restoration, He also chose David (the type of Christ) to shepherd His people. With the Lord&#8217;s recovery there is always the shepherding, the feeding of Christ.<h2 class=head1>PSALMS 79 AND 80-RESTORATION BY EXALTING CHRIST</h2><p>Psalms 79 and 80 tell us how the house and the city of God became desolate, but that the hope of recovery is in Christ, &#8220;the man of God&#8217;s right hand.&#8221; Verses 1 to 3 of Psalm 79 indicate the desolation of God&#8217;s house and city. &#8220;O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps&#8221; (v. 1). No doubt this refers to the destruction wrought by the Babylonians. But the hope of recovery is in Christ. &#8220;Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine (the people of Israel); and the vineyard maintain which thy right hand hath planted, and the son that thou madest strong for thyself&#8221; (Psa. 80:14-15). The Psalmist here is crying to God, that God would maintain the vineyard which His right hand has planted. God had planted the children of Israel as a vine and the nation as a vineyard. The Psalmist prayed that God would maintain, protect, and preserve this vineyard. Notice in verse 15 that the word &#8220;branch&#8221; as in the King James version must be changed to &#8220;son,&#8221; &#8220;the son that thou madest strong for thyself.&#8221; Obviously, this Son must be Christ. We have indicated that many times in the Psalms, in the midst of the saints&#8217; expression, the Spirit of Christ suddenly intervenes and utters something within their utterance. This is just such an occasion. The Spirit of Christ is here uttering something concerning Christ within the utterance of the crying saints. The meaning here is that God will protect His dwelling place for Christ. God will protect, God will preserve, and God will maintain His dwelling place for the sake of Christ. Christ is the Son that God has made strong for Himself.<p>Psalm 80:17-19: &#8220;Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. Restore us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.&#8221; In this poetic utterance of the seeking saint, the Spirit of Christ is saying something concerning Christ. It is that the restoration of God&#8217;s dwelling place depends wholly upon Christ. We must give Christ the proper position; then the desolated house of God will be restored. By the Psalmist&#8217;s assertion that the restoration of God&#8217;s house depends upon the position given to Christ, we learn the reason for the desolation of the house of God. The house is desolate because the position of Christ has been lost among God&#8217;s people. If we would recover the house of God, we must afford Christ His proper position. His position is that of the Man whom God has made strong for Himself, the Man who is at the right hand of God. This indicates His pre-eminence, His first place. The right hand of God is the first and highest place in the entire universe, and God has put Christ there. God has given the pre-eminence of the whole universe to Christ. He must be in that position, but among the people of God He has not been exalted to that position. He has lost His pre-eminence; so the house of God has become desolate. Where is Christ in all the so-called Christian churches, in all the denominations? Christ has lost His pre-eminence; Christ is not in the first position; the people have put Christ aside. Hence, desolation has entered.<p>In these days we are so happy to speak well of the local churches. But remember, Christ must have the first place among us. If Christ does not have the pre-eminence, there can be no restoration of the house of God. Desolation has resulted from the loss of His proper position, and recovery will result from our rendering to Christ His due place. He is the Man who is made strong for God, and He is the Man at the right hand of God. We must give Him this position; we must recognize His pre-eminence in the whole universe. If so, we will see the house of God restored.<p>Suppose that two brothers of a local church in a certain city talk together in a critical way about the leading brothers of that church. Do you believe that they are giving the pre-eminence to Christ? Actually, they are putting themselves in the first place. They are exalting themselves, not Christ. In that place two horns will rise up on the head. When those brothers come together to speak about the situation of the church, instead of criticizing, they must say, &#8220;Lord, we give You the pre-eminence; we are under Your headship. We are nobody; You are the only One, Lord.&#8221;<p>Suppose now that the leading brothers of that particular local church hear these two young brothers speaking in such a way and are deeply offended. They arise to defend themselves and assert their authority. If the leading brothers react in this way, it means that they also are not under the headship of Christ, that they also are not giving Christ the pre-eminence. They should bow down and say, &#8220;Lord, the pre-eminence is Thine, the first place is Yours. Though we may be the leading ones, we are nobody. The young brothers are not wrong; we are really poor.&#8221; Perhaps the brothers and sisters in that place may, in a sense, be poor, but they are giving the first place to the Lord, the pre-eminence to Christ. There you will see the restoration of God&#8217;s house. If they fight one with another, the young people against the leading ones, and the leading ones against the young people, there will only be desolation. The young people will attempt to justify themselves, and the leading ones will vindicate their position. This is nothing but desolation. They are desolating the church. Whenever Christ loses His pre-eminence among us, the church is wrong. We all must submit ourselves to His headship and say, &#8220;None among us is anybody; You are the only One, Lord, who has the pre- eminence. We give You the pre-eminence, Lord.&#8221; Regardless of how weak we are, regardless of how poor we are, if we take this attitude, there is the possibility for the restoration of God&#8217;s house. The desolation will be past; it will be swallowed up by the restoration.<p>Christ must be afforded the proper position by the people of God. God has already given Him the highest place in the universe. Now every one of us, both the young brothers and sisters and the elder brothers and sisters, must give Him His due place. Never take the pre-eminence among the Lord&#8217;s people in the local church; the pre-eminence must always be given to Christ. The first secret for us in maintaining the house of God and restoring it from desolation is to give the pre-eminence to Christ.<p>Sometimes the sisters in the local churches cause the problem by not giving the pre-eminence to the Lord. Philippians 4 speaks of two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, who caused a problem in the church at Philippi. It is strange that I have never heard of parents naming their daughters by these two names. At the beginning, the situation in that church was excellent, but then a problem arose due to these two sisters. Many times, simply because of two sisters, there is disunity in a church. In one of the local churches recently, I referred to these two sisters in Philippians 4, and on the very next day a sister stood up, weeping, confessing her faults and asking another sister to forgive her. Both of them wept. Some of the brothers said to me later, &#8220;When you spoke from Philippians 4, you prophesied concerning the condition here. These two sisters were the problem in this local church.&#8221; If any of us, especially any of the sisters, fail to give the pre-eminence to the Lord, there will be desolation in the church. The church life will be restored if we will always say, &#8220;We are nobody; Christ is the only One; we give Him the pre-eminence.&#8221;<p>You must pray-read these two verses, Psalm 80:15 and 17, and stay with them for some time. &#8220;And the vineyard maintain which thy right hand hath planted, and the son that thou madest strong for thyself....Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.&#8221; This is Christ, the unique Man, the unique Son. This is the One who has been approved at the right hand of God the Father. He has the pre-eminence, the first place in the entire universe, and we must recognize this. If we as God&#8217;s people will give Him such pre-eminence, the restoration of the church life will take place. The desolation of the church is due mostly to Christ not being given His rightful position.<h2 class=head1>PSALMS 81 TO 83-GOD&#8217;S INTENTION AND SATAN&#8217;S PLOT</h2><p>Psalms 81 to 83 tell how Christ will judge and inherit the earth, and how the enemy desires to take God&#8217;s habitation in possession.<p>I must repeat again that the Psalms are written in the style of poetry, and for this reason it is really difficult to understand them. I believe that by this time the Psalms have become a different book to many of you. You thought they were merely a source of consolation, but now you see in them Christ, God&#8217;s dwelling place, the house and city of God, and the way God will gain the earth. In order to understand the Psalms we must enter the heart of the Psalmist and get into the spirit of all the seeking saints. In the spirit of the saints, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, was uttering something. We cannot just read the Psalms in an outward way. That is why we have spent so much time to see what is in the heart of all the Psalmists and what is hidden in all the Psalms. It is nothing but Christ and the church as the house and the city of God.<p>Do not be frustrated or troubled by so many verses and sayings in all the Psalms. Years ago in my home province, certain types of crystals were mined from the ground. I had seen these beautiful stones on the market for years, but one day I was shown their original condition in the form of a large, rough, and ugly stone. Then I was shown, after a cut was made into the very heart of that ugly mass, a crystal, so transparent, colorful, and beautiful. On the outside there were many unsightly layers, but after these were removed, a beautiful crystal appeared. In the Psalms there are many verses. I would not say that some are ugly, but that many of these verses do not seem so meaningful. Yet we need them. For example, Psalm 78 is a very long Psalm concerning the failure, unfaithfulness and dishonesty of God&#8217;s people. Many times when I was young, I grew tired of reading that passage of the Bible. I thought it would be far better to shorten it. But within that Psalm, there are at least these four verses, verses 65, 66, 68 and 69, which are as crystals. Verse 65 says that one day the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, as a mighty man. Verse 66 says that He smote all His enemies; verse 68 says that He chose Judah, the mount Zion; and verse 69 says that He built His sanctuary like high palaces and stable as the earth. These are the crystals. Do not be frustrated and troubled by all the other verses. We must go through them until we hit all these significant verses.<p>In Psalms 81 through 83 there are not many crystals, but there are two points which indicate that God&#8217;s intention is to inherit the earth. Psalm 82:8 says, &#8220;Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.&#8221; This is a crystal verse. God&#8217;s intention is to possess the earth through Christ. Then in Psalm 83, verse 12, the enemy says, &#8220;Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.&#8221; By putting these two verses together and comparing them, we see that God&#8217;s intention is to inherit the earth, and Satan&#8217;s plot is to take the houses of God in possession. Could you see the subtlety? Here is the struggle that has arisen. With whom will you stand? With God for the earth, or with Satan to take over God&#8217;s dwelling places?<p>God&#8217;s intention is to give Christ His right position throughout the local churches and then, through the churches, to take over the whole earth. Satan knows this, and so his goal is to take over God&#8217;s dwelling places and thus withhold the earth from God. But, according to Psalm 83, God will surely do something to show His enemies that He alone is the most High over all the earth. &#8220;That men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high over all the earth&#8221; (v. 18). We have full assurance in these last days that God is going to defeat all His enemies. Regardless of how much desolation the enemy has wrought, regardless of how much he is still working to damage the local churches, God will defeat him. One day through the local churches the whole universe will know that God alone is the most High over all the earth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SAINTS&#8217; LOVE FOR  THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalm 84</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 84:1-12</h1><p>In Book II we have reached the highest peak, with the house and the city as the stepping-stone for the Lord to regain the earth. But we still need more, for by the end of Book II we have only seen the positive side. There is also the negative aspect. Following the day, we have the night; therefore, after Book II we have Book III, revealing the possibility of losing the enjoyment of the house and city of God.<p>How wonderful it is to be in the house and in the city, but we must realize that it is possible for this sweet enjoyment to be lost. There is even something which will affect us in a more personal way than this: at a certain point God will take away even all our material blessings; we will be stripped. According to our past experiences, this is exactly what has happened. After we have come to the local church and enjoyed it greatly, the stripping hand of God has come to take away many things. How contrary this experience is to our religious concept! In religion we are told that if we love the Lord, we will be healthy and prosper in every way. We have taught others and have even taught our children in this way. I would not say that this concept is either wrong or right, but that it is wholly religious. If it is right, it is religiously right. According to our experience, however, we can testify that, when we love the Lord, He begins gradually to strip us of many things. I myself have gone through the very experience of the Psalmist in Psalm 73. While I was suffering and being stripped, I looked at others in the world with their prosperity, and I asked the Lord, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Sooner or later, perhaps not today, but someday the Lord will begin to take away, even from the young brothers and sisters who love Him, all the good things. The Lord will strip you. Not until you go into the sanctuary will you understand. He strips us that we may enjoy Himself in an absolute way. This is the first aspect of the Psalms in Book III. When we learn to say with the Psalmist, &#8220;Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee,&#8221; we have made a real improvement.<p>The second aspect of Book III is that among the Lord&#8217;s children we must continually give Christ the pre-eminence. If the Man at the right hand of God is not given His rightful position, we will have a problem with the house of God and lose the enjoyment of the local church. The right hand of God is the first place in the entire universe, and that is the position we must give Christ in the church life. This brings in the restoration, which swallows up all the desolation in the local churches.<h2 class=head1>A DEEPER LOVE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 84, which depicts how the saints love the house of God and desire to dwell therein. Surely by now we can say with the Psalmist in verse 1, &#8220;How lovely are thy dwelling places!&#8221; There is not only one dwelling place, but many dwelling places. No doubt these dwelling places signify the local churches. The local churches can be so lovely to us; we can even be homesick for them. Many of you have been in the local churches for only a short time, perhaps not more than a year or two. This is a honeymoon. The honeymoon will not last too long. But after all the desolation and negative experiences are past, you will sense that the house of God is much more lovely than it ever was when you first came into it.<p>I can never forget my first five years in the local church-it was a real honeymoon. I felt that every day was so wonderful. Indeed, it seemed that my honeymoon with the local church would never end. But one day the trial came: it was a real problem, and the entire church was nearly swept away by it. Then, for almost ten years, one trial after another came upon the local churches. But, praise the Lord, after all these difficult experiences, the local church became sweeter and more lovable to me than ever before.<p>Psalm 84 does not precede the stripping and the desolation of God&#8217;s house, but follows it. After the stripping and desolation, in the recovery and restoration, the house of God is sweeter than ever before. How lovable are the dwelling places of God! Young brothers and sisters, keep this in mind: if the Lord delays, you will see ten years from now how much sweeter the local churches are to you than they are today. I cannot tell you how lovable they are to me. In John chapter two we read about the best wine. But, I tell you, in my experience the local churches are better and sweeter than the very best wine.<p>If I could check with the sisters concerning the love they have for their husbands, I believe many would testify that the love they now have, after going through many trials and experiences together, is stronger, deeper, and sweeter than the love of their honeymoon. Over the years and through many trials they have built up a love so strong that nothing can break it.<p>The love in Psalm 84 is not a honeymoon love; it is a love which follows many trials. It is not the love of Psalm 26:8 (&#8220;Lord, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth&#8221;), nor is it the love of Psalm 27:4 (&#8220;One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple&#8221;). In the church life there is the honeymoon period, and there is the period following many experiences and trials. In Psalm 84 we have a hint of the trials: &#8220;Passing through the valley of weeping, (they) make it a place of springs...&#8221; (v. 6). This is not initial love; this is love matured through many trials. It requires some years to come to this point. Keep in mind that Psalm 84 is not in the first book of the Psalms, but in the third book. It is not only long after the honeymoon, but it even follows an extended time of &#8220;married life.&#8221; After a certain period of trials, we can testify how lovable the local churches are.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO ALTARS</h2><p>Now let us consider the various aspects of the Psalmist&#8217;s experience concerning the house. The first aspect of His enjoyment, poetically speaking, is the two altars. &#8220;Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God!&#8221; (v. 3). Undoubtedly we are the sparrows, we are the swallows, we are the little creatures, so small and so frail. Yet we may find a house. We have already mentioned that in the Psalms, whenever the house of God is mentioned, it is presented not only as a place in which God may dwell, but as the place where we also may find our home. This is the sweet feeling of the Psalmist concerning the house of God. It is a place for the little sparrows to abide. It is a place for the swallow to build a nest for herself, where she may lay her young. We find a home in the house of God, and this home is at the two altars.<p>In ancient times, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, there were two altars: one was in the outer court, and the other was in the holy place; one was without, and the other was within. The altar in the outer court was the place for the offerings, which dealt with all negative things, which cleansed, redeemed, and delivered from all problems. The altar in the holy place was the altar of incense, which signifies the resurrected Christ as our acceptance to God. Hence, these two altars signify the crucifixion of Christ and Christ in resurrection. Together, they embody in type all that Christ is with all that He has accomplished and attained. It is here that we find our home; it is here that we find our rest in the house of God. All the little ones in the local churches must realize and apprehend the significance of the crucifixion and the resurrection of Christ, with all that He has accomplished and attained for us. I say again, the Psalms are poetry, and we must understand them in a poetic way.<p>We need to care for the little ones in the local churches by helping them realize the value and meaning of the first altar, and the significance and worth of the second altar. We must cause them to apprehend how Christ is the crucified One at the offering altar and the resurrected One at the incense altar that they may enjoy all the goodness of the crucified Christ and the resurrected Christ. It is here at the altars that we have a real resting place, a true nest for the little ones. This is the first item of all the enjoyment in the local churches.<h2 class=head1>CONTINUALLY PRAISING AND TRUSTING IN GOD</h2><p>The second item is the praising: &#8220;Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be praising thee all the day long. Selah&#8221; (v. 4). Henceforth, whenever we meet together, we must spend much time in praising. The praising should occupy more of the time in our meetings than the teachings. &#8220;They will be praising thee all the day long.&#8221; Learn to praise Him.<p>The third aspect of the enjoyment is that in the local church we have the very God to trust in: &#8220;O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee&#8221; (v. 12). Indeed, we may all trust in God outside of the local church, but it is rather difficult. In the local church, we can testify, it is so easy to trust in God. If you have not tasted, you do not know. Even the young ones can bear witness to this fact. Come into the local church and stay there for just two months, and you will see how easy it is to trust in God when you are in the meetings. At home it is rather arduous, but in the meetings it is spontaneous. In the local churches we have the very God to trust in.<p>There are other blessings issuing from the house of God in this Psalm, but I mention just these three: the altars, where we may rest; the continual praise (it is praise to the Lord, but it is our enjoyment); and the place where we have the very God, in whom we may trust. These are the main blessings of making our home in God&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head1>HIGHWAYS TO ZION IN OUR HEARTS</h2><p>Psalm 84 also shows us the way to Zion. We go to Zion, firstly, by trusting in God. &#8220;Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee&#8221; (v. 12). Secondly, the highways of Zion must be in our hearts: &#8220;Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the highways to Zion&#8221; (v. 5). This is indeed interesting. Whenever we take a way to reach a certain goal, the way is always outside of us. But the highways to Zion are within us.<p>Do you take the way of the church externally or internally? Is the way of the church within you or without? If it is outside of you, it will not last long. The highway to Zion must be within us. The only way to walk in the church life is not outwardly, but inwardly. It is not an external matter, but an internal one.<p>Sometimes people speak of the ground of the church and the practice of the church as merely external matters. I do not agree. They may, in a sense, be external things, but all these external things must be within us. If they are merely external to you, sooner or later you will drift away. You may be in the way today, but tomorrow you will go astray. Praise the Lord, the highways to Zion are in our hearts. We take the Lord&#8217;s way, we go the church way, not from without, but from within. It is absolutely not something external, but something which is very subjective to us.<p>Sometimes we have the concept that the matter of the church ground and the church practice are not matters of life. Sometimes we hear others say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about life; don&#8217;t talk about the church ground.&#8221; In earlier days I had the same concept, but I&#8217;ve gradually been delivered from this kind of deceit. Never say that the church ground has nothing to do with life. It is absolutely a matter of life. I am fully assured that if any one of you is wrong in life, you will be distracted from the way of the church. In other words, when you are out of the church way, you are erring, at least to some extent, in the way of spiritual life. The matter of the church ground and the way of the church practice has very much to do with the inner life. When we are deeply in the inner life, we will certainly be in the way of the church; the highways to Zion will be within us.<p>If we adopt the church life in a cheap way, it means that the life within us is extremely poor. But I do believe that many of us have taken the way of the church at a certain cost. It did not cost me so much to take the Lord Jesus as my Savior as it did to take the church way. To receive the Lord Jesus as my Savior cost me almost nothing, but I can testify that it was very costly for me to take the church way. Do not imagine that the highway to Zion is external, superficial, and cheap. It is quite the opposite. It is at a price that we take the church way and forever remain on the highway to Zion.<h2 class=head1>THE VALLEY OF WEEPING-A PLACE OF SPRINGS</h2><p>Such a person passes through the valley of weeping and makes it a place of springs. It does not say that God makes it a place of springs, but that we make it such. We are always inclined to think that everything depends on God. But it is not God&#8217;s responsibility to make the valley of weeping a place of springs. Whether the valley of weeping is a place of blessing or not depends wholly on us, not on God. If you take the church way, at a certain point you will encounter many trials and troubles. If you turn away, you will find yourself in a real valley of weeping. But if you are faithful at any cost, if you say, &#8220;Lord, even at the cost of my life, I will still go on,&#8221; you will make the valley of weeping a place of springs.<p>You may consider that a certain brother is a real help to you; you enjoy fellowship with him so much. But I am afraid that one day this very brother will be a real problem and trial to you. You may have a little foretaste of it now, but the full taste will come. More than two-thirds of my human life has been in the church life. Under the covering of the Lord&#8217;s precious blood I can tell you that my sorest trials have been from dear brothers, dear sisters, dear co-workers. Some of the closest ones have become the thorns. You may say that one brother is a trial to you, but one day you will be a thorn to him. If in the day of trial, you turn back, you will make the valley a true valley of weeping. I have seen many in the past who have done this. Once they have turned away from the church, they have turned into the valley of weeping. But I must also confess that I have seen many who, in spite of all the trials, have still gone on in the church. I can testify that their weeping was transformed into blessing. The tears were transformed into springs, into rain which covered the valley with blessings.<p>Do not suppose that I am passing on some kind of teaching. My burden in sharing all the verses of these Psalms is to point out the attitude you must take to go on in the church life. I have no desire to impart some form of knowledge about the church. The highway to Zion passes through the valley. This valley may eventually be a valley of weeping, or a place of springs, a place of blessing. It depends upon your attitude. When the church is good and everything is fine, we may praise the Lord. In these years here in Los Angeles, the church life has indeed been wonderful. But it is altogether possible that it might not always be so good. Sometimes the brothers may not be so lovable, to put it mildly. In fact, they may seem unbearable as far as you are concerned. Sometimes the co-workers may not be so pleasant to you. Sometimes the meetings may not be so living. Then what will you do? Will you quit, will you turn away? Will you say, &#8220;What is the difference between the local church and the denominations?&#8221; In fact, sometimes the local church may not seem as good as the denominations. Will you go back? Be careful; it all depends upon you. It is not God&#8217;s responsibility. It is yours. It is not God who makes the valley of weeping a place of blessing; it is you.<h2 class=head1>THE PLACE OF FULLEST BLESSING</h2><p>The more you go on in the local church, the more strength you will gain. &#8220;They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God&#8221; (v. 7). It is not your own strength, but the strength of God. Just go on. There is no need for you to consider, to hesitate, to turn away. Even if it is the Red Sea, go through it. Even if it is the Jordan, go through it. It is absolutely a matter of faith. Do not look at the situation. If you do, you will be disappointed. You may see the sea ahead of you, or the river-in either case it is deep water. But go on. Praise the Lord, when you go on, you have the strength. The Lord is ahead of you. If you continue in the church way, you will go from strength to strength, and you will appear before God in Zion.<p>&#8220;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand&#8221; (v. 10). In the Bible, one thousand signifies the fullest measure of a complete unit. Ezekiel 47 speaks of the measurement of a thousand cubits, and the millennium covers a period of a thousand years. Hence, the blessing we receive by being in the dwelling place of the Lord is the fullest, the uttermost. Nowhere else can we receive a blessing as full as that which we obtain in the courts of the house of God. If you go to a meeting which you consider poor and feel that you haven&#8217;t gained anything from it, you may think it is better to stay home. All right, stay home. It may be good for a little while, possibly for a few weeks. But I can assure you that after three months of staying home and not attending the meetings, you will be back in the world. I do not care how much you obtain at home; it can never compare with the blessings you receive in the local church. Even if the local church is poor, you just come to it; you will get the blessing. You may in fact get some blessing elsewhere, but not a thousandfold. If you want the fullest blessing, if you would turn one good day into a thousand, you must come to the local churches. &#8220;For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.&#8221; Here in the house of God we enjoy God as a sun and a shield. The sun is for supply, and the shield is for protection. Here in the church life God is our supply, and God is our safeguard. Here we enjoy His grace and His glory. Grace is the inner enjoyment, and glory is the outward expression. In the church life we have the inner enjoyment of grace and the outward expression of glory; we have a supply as the sun, and God Himself as our shield. Oh, how blessed is the church life!<p>&#8220;O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee&#8221; (v. 12). Where? In the house of God. Three times in this Psalm it says, &#8220;Blessed is the man&#8221;: &#8220;Blessed are they that dwell in thy house&#8221; (v. 4); &#8220;Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee&#8221; (v. 5); &#8220;Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee&#8221; (v. 12). How absolutely different this is from Psalm 1, which says that the man is blessed who keeps the law. &#8220;Blessed are they that dwell in thy house.&#8221; They are the ones who go from strength to strength. They are the ones who trust in God. These are the blessings of the church life!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S HEART IS SET UPON ZION WITH CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 85 to 89</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 87:1-7; 89:19-21, 25-27, 29, 36-37</h1><p>Before we come to the end of Book III, we need to review the main points we have already covered in the Psalms.<h2 class=head1>SUMMARY OF THE FIRST THREE BOOKS OF THE PSALMS</h2><p>We have seen that Book I, Psalms 1 to 41, indicates how God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God. Such a sentence is not long, but it is very costly. Do not esteem it lightly. This is the summary of the first forty-one Psalms. In this summary of Book 1, there are three key words: the law, Christ, and the house. God has turned His saints from the law to His Anointed, for the house. Christ is for the house; Christ is for the church. If we, the saints of God, do not contact the house, there is no place for us to enjoy the riches of Christ. Though we have Christ, yet without the house we have no place to enjoy Him. God&#8217;s intention is that through Christ the house may come into existence for the enjoyment of His people. The church is God&#8217;s desire, His intention, and His eternal purpose. Thus, in the first book we have the law on the negative side, and Christ and the house on the positive side.<p>I can testify that I had been a Christian for many years before I knew what the Psalms spoke about. It is easy to grasp the book of Romans; it is easy to comprehend the content of the book of Acts; but you can read through the Psalms several times and still not apprehend their message. We need divine revelation to see that God&#8217;s intention in the first book of the Psalms is to turn our thoughts, our concept, our understanding, from the law to Christ, that we may enjoy His house.<p>We have also seen that Book II, Psalms 42 to 72, indicates how the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ. When we come to the second book, we have the deeper experiences of Christ; hence, the house is increased to a city. We enjoy God through Christ, we enjoy God&#8217;s house through Christ, and we enjoy God&#8217;s city through Christ. In the second book we see the suffering, exalted, reigning, and coming Christ. It is through such a Christ that we enjoy God and His house and city.<p>We need to put the first and second books of the Psalms together to apprehend their combined message. In the first book God brings us to Christ, and then we have the house for enjoyment. The second book continues by telling us that through further and deeper experiences of Christ, the house is increased to a city. Here, in the house and in the city, we enjoy God with this house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ. In these few sentences we have crystallized the message of Book I and Book II of the Psalms.<p>Every book in the Psalms is a continuation of the previous one. Therefore Book III, Psalms 73 to 89, continues Book II by telling how the saints in their experiences realize that the house and the city of God with all the enjoyments thereof can only be preserved and maintained with Christ properly appreciated and exalted by God&#8217;s people. In the first two books we have Christ, the house, and the city-this is the peak, the highest enjoyment, of the saints. But, as we have seen, it is always difficult to maintain such a high standard for long. God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s city were damaged, and desolation ensued. Yet, through this experience, the saints realized how to preserve the enjoyment of the house and city of God. When Christ is given His proper position in the church, we can continually preserve the church life at the peak.<p>Have you been deeply impressed by these three books? Without these summaries, it is difficult to apprehend them. In short, in the first book we have Christ in the house; in the second book we have the house and the city; and in the third book we have the desolation and how to maintain the enjoyment of God&#8217;s house and city through Christ.<p>Let us recall now the leading Psalms in each of these three books. In Book I, Psalm 1 is a good Psalm negatively. A good painting requires a proper background. Without a dark background, it is difficult to set forth a bright figure. The darker the background, the brighter the main image will be. Hence the leading Psalms of Book I are Psalm 1 on the negative side, and Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23, 24, 27, and 36 on the positive side. Finally we should include Psalm 31, verse 21, which speaks of the strong city.<p>In Book II the leading Psalms are Psalms 45, 46, 48, 68, and 72. In these Psalms we see Christ in a deeper way, the house, the city and the earth. These leading Psalms present the main features of Book II solidly and adequately and bring us to the climax of enjoyment. In these Psalms we also have the move of God, the victory of the Lord, with all the praises of the saints. Then, at the end, we have Christ&#8217;s reign over the entire earth.<p>In Book III we have already considered three leading Psalms: Psalms 73, 80, and 84. In Psalm 73 we have seen how we need God as our unique portion, and in Psalm 80 we have seen how Christ must have the unique position. When these are secured we have, in Psalm 84, the sweeter experience of the house of God. The house becomes much sweeter than before the desolation. It has been recovered by the experience of God as our unique portion and by Christ being given the unique position. It is by this that the house is sweeter than ever.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 87-GOD&#8217;S HEART IS SET ON ZION</h2><p>Now we come to the end of Book III, Psalms 85 to 89. In Psalm 85 the saints ask God for restoration, and in Psalm 86 for salvation; but in Psalm 87 we see that God&#8217;s heart is set on Zion, His city, with Christ within it. Zion here refers not only to the house, but to the house with the city. God does not care for restoration as we do; God does not desire salvation as we do. His desire, His heart, is set upon Zion with Christ within it. It is indeed significant that preceding Psalm 87 are Psalms 85 and 86. In Psalm 85 the Psalmist says, &#8220;Turn us, O God&#8221; (v. 4). According to the original language, this verse should read, &#8220;Restore us, O God.&#8221; Psalm 85 is a prayer for restoration. In Psalm 86 the Psalmist says, &#8220;O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee&#8221; (v. 2). Psalm 86 is a prayer for salvation. These are the desires of the saints, but God&#8217;s desire is not for these things. His desire is for Zion with His Christ.<p>Today we are the same as the Psalmists: we are continually desiring restoration and salvation. God would say to us: &#8220;Do not be like that. I am for Zion; I am for the church. If you allow me to have my church, no problem will exist regarding your restoration. If you allow me to have my church, nothing can withhold any kind of deliverance, any kind of salvation.&#8221; The church is the real restoration, the real salvation, the real deliverance.<p>In Psalm 87 we see how Zion is central in God&#8217;s heart. Let us look at this Psalm more closely. The first three verses are easy to understand, but the following three verses are more difficult. There are seven verses in this Psalm with two Selahs, one at the end of the first three verses, and the other at the end of the next three verses. &#8220;His foundation is in the holy mountains. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah&#8221; (vv. 1-3). Christ is the unique foundation laid by God. No other foundation can any man lay. This Christ, this foundation of God, is in the holy mountains, the local churches. It is there that we have no other foundation but Christ. This is clear. &#8220;The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.&#8221; In the eyes of God the church is more lovable than anything else. The gates are the places of coming in and going out: this is the communication, the fellowship, among God&#8217;s people. The most lovely aspect of the local church is the fellowship. It is so good, so pleasant, for the brothers to be always coming and going in fellowship. How blessed to have brothers from one church visiting another, coming and going in sweet harmony and fellowship! This is lovable in the eyes of God. He loves the gates of Zion more than all other places. &#8220;Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.&#8221; How glorious is the local church!<h2 class=head1>NONE CAN COMPARE WITH ZION</h2><p>Verses 4 to 6 are written poetically. In these three verses God&#8217;s intention is to make a contrast, a comparison, of all other places with Zion. In verse 2 God declares that He loves the gates of Zion. But besides Zion on this earth there are many other places. First of all, there is Egypt, which is mentioned here as Rahab (v. 4). People in ancient times boasted of Egypt. It was a wonderful place. Secondly, Babylon is mentioned. In ancient times Babylon was indeed great. Thirdly, there is Philistia, and fourthly, Tyre, which were famous centers of civilization in ancient times. Fifthly, there is Ethiopia, which also had built a reputation. Egypt was well known for its natural resources. When there was famine in Canaan, there was food in Egypt. Babylon was famous in the realm of human success and glory. It was a continuation of Babel, where man endeavored to glorify himself by building a tower to heaven. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, built a great and powerful empire, a monument to man&#8217;s success and glory. Philistia was a place in close proximity to the holy land. The Philistines, according to the Bible, were exceedingly clever. When the ark of God was captured and brought into their country, they had a way to deal with it. They were adept in handling holy things according to human wisdom. On this earth, in all these centuries, there have been many Egypts, many Babylons, many places with many peoples who are near to the holy things and who handle them with human cleverness. They boast of this. Tyre, according to history and the Bible, was full of merchandise and commerce. This was their glory. Ethiopia was a place from which people were continually coming to learn of the holy land. The queen of Sheba was from Ethiopia, and she came to learn something of Solomon. The eunuch in Acts chapter eight was from Ethiopia; he also came to the holy land to learn.<p>Here are five places, representing five categories of peoples. But none of them can compare with Zion. People may say that this man was born in Egypt and that one was born in Babylon; this man was born in Philistia and that one was born in Tyre. But God says that this man and that man and so many men were born in Zion. David was born there; Elijah was born there; Peter and Paul were born there; Martin Luther was born there. Eventually, we read, &#8220;The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah&#8221; (v. 6). Who is this one? This is the unique One, Christ. Verse 5 tells us of this man and that man, including all the saints, but verse 6 records that this One, even Christ Himself, was born there. This is Zion&#8217;s boast. Zion boasts in Christ and in all the saints. Egypt could say that the Pharaohs were born there; Babylon would say that Nebuchadnezzar was born there; but Zion can say that David, Elijah, Peter, Paul, so many saints, and ultimately Christ Himself were born there. Who is greater, Pharaoh or David, Nebuchadnezzar or Paul? There is no comparison. And who can compare with Christ? All those in Zion may well boast in Zion. God, the Most High Himself, shall establish her. Hallelujah!<p>Verse 7: &#8220;As well the singers as the players on instruments shall say: All my springs are in thee.&#8221; Praise the Lord! In Zion we do not have the mourners; we just have the singers and the players-all of them praising the Lord. In Zion we have many giants-David, Elijah, Peter, Paul, and others. But we also have many singers. We may not be the giants, but at least we are the singers. You may think that you cannot sing well, but at least you can praise. All the singers and players are for praising. In Zion there are not many preachers and teachers, but there are many singers and players. They all say, &#8220;All my springs are in thee.&#8221; The springs are the fountains of waters. All the springs and all the fountains are in the city of Zion. This is the church and the local churches, and we are the singers and the players.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 89-CHRIST AS KING POSSESSING THE EARTH</h2><p>In Psalm 88 one saint cries in himself for God&#8217;s deliverance from his suffering, but in Psalm 89 another saint praises God for His covenant with Christ as the center. Here is another contrast: one crying for his own deliverance, and one praising God for His covenant.<p>Let us consider briefly the content of Psalm 89. In verses 19 to 21 we see Christ as God&#8217;s Holy One, God&#8217;s Mighty One, God&#8217;s Anointed One, whom God has chosen and exalted, and whom He shall strengthen. In verse 26 He calls God His Father and His God. (See John 20:17.) God has made Him His firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth (v. 27), and He shall take the earth from the sea to the rivers (v. 25). It is rather difficult to say what the sea is (singular), and what the rivers are (plural). But I believe this means, poetically, that Christ will take over the entire earth. His throne is for ever and ever (vv. 29, 36-37). He will be the King in the Kingdom, and His throne is eternal.<p>Now we have reached the end of Book III and have seen two additional outstanding Psalms-Psalm 87 and Psalm 89. Psalm 87 is of Zion, the house and the city, and Psalm 89 is of Christ as the King who will possess the entire earth. Hence, there are five outstanding Psalms in Book III: Psalm 73, God as our unique portion; Psalm 80, Christ in the place of pre-eminence; Psalm 84, an all-inclusive Psalm with the sweeter experience of the house of God; Psalm 87, Zion, including the house and the city; and Psalm 89, Christ as King possessing the entire earth.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>ONE WITH GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 90 to 92</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 90:1-2, 4, 17; 91:1-2, 4, 9, 11-12, 14-16; 92:1-5, 10, 12-15</h1><p>The main points in both the second and third books of the Psalms are identical: each book sets forth the house and the city, and eventually, in the last Psalm of each book, Christ reigning over the entire earth. Both Book II and Book III conclude with the same glorious event. Such a conclusion, however, is not found at the end of Book I of the Psalms, because at that point the message of the Psalms is not yet complete. At the end of Book II everything is completed. We have Christ in the deeper experiences of the saints, and we have the house and the city; therefore, Christ is set forth as the One who is coming to reign over the entire earth. After the desolation, then, in Book III, we have the restoration of all that was gained in Book II. Therefore, Book III must contain all that was originally found in Book II. In Book II we had the house and the city with Christ reigning over the earth, and now in Book III, in the restoration, we have the same thing-the house and the city, with Christ reigning over the entire earth. In Book III, everything in Book II has been restored: the enjoyment of God is restored, the experience of Christ is restored, the appreciation and love for the house and the city have been restored, and Christ reigning over the entire earth has been restored. Therefore Book III is nearly the same as Book II. This is very significant.<h2 class=head1>SONS OF A REBEL COMPOSE SONGS OF RESTORATION</h2><p>Now let us consider briefly the authorship of the Psalms. Many Christians presume that all the Psalms were composed by David. As far as Book I is concerned, this maybe true; at least most of the Psalms in Book I were written by David. But have you noticed that all the Psalms from Psalm 42 through Psalm 48-all these deeper and more precious Psalms-were not written by David. Psalm 68, that glorious and climactic Psalm, was indeed written by David. Psalm 72, however, was written by Solomon, and Psalms 73 and 80 were written by some other author. Notice now the authorship of Psalms 42, 45 through 48, 84, and 87, which include some of the deepest Psalms of Books II and III. All these deeper Psalms were written by the sons of Korah. This is remarkable. Numbers 26 gives us the background of these men: &#8220;This is that Dathan and Abiram which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the Lord: and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died...notwithstanding the sons of Korah died not&#8221; (vv. 9-11). This chapter makes reference to the rebellion of a group of God&#8217;s people under the leadership of Korah. When God intervened to vindicate and judge, Korah was devoured, but his children were spared. Had they died, we would not have all those wonderful, deeper Psalms, which we have mentioned. The sons of a leading rebel composed all those Psalms concerning God&#8217;s restoration. This is a real restoration.<p>When I first realized this, something leaped within me. We can tell the whole universe, &#8220;Satan, look at this; I do not care how much you can do; you may even cause some brothers to be rebellious. But, look out, some of their sons will be spared to write the deeper Psalms of God&#8217;s restoration.&#8221;<p>Almost all of the deeper Psalms, the Psalms which are so sweet and precious to us, were written by the sons of Korah. The sons of Korah wrote Psalm 42:1, &#8220;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.&#8221; The sons of Korah, not David or Solomon wrote Psalm 45:1, &#8220;My heart is bubbling over with a good thing. I speak what I have composed touching the King.&#8221; Can you imagine this? Psalms 46 and 48, those marvelous Psalms on the city of God, were written by the sons of Korah. The Holy Spirit does not mention their names, but refers to them only as the sons of Korah. Regardless of what the enemy can do, the Lord always wins a glorious victory! It was the sons of Korah who wrote, &#8220;How lovely are thy dwelling places&#8221; (Psa. 84:1). How much blessing has been brought through the sons of Korah to so many saints by Psalm 84. Psalm 87, that gem of a Psalm concerning Zion and those who are born there, was written by the sons of Korah. Satan may say, &#8220;Look, I caused this one to be rebellious.&#8221; But we may tell him, &#8220;Just wait, some sons of Korah will come out. What you destroy, God will raise up again, and the psalms of God&#8217;s restoration will be composed by the sons of Korah, the sons of the leading rebel.&#8221;<p>Whenever I read Numbers 26 as a youth, I hated Korah. But almost all the deeper Psalms were written by the sons of this rebel. This is God&#8217;s marvelous, miraculous doing. What assurance we may have that God is going to recover the local churches and that eventually many sons of rebels will compose some praising psalms! Just one Korah rebelled, but many sons came out of him and became composers of the deeper Psalms.<p>To compose a hymn or write a psalm requires many experiences. This proves that the sons of Korah had gained many deeper experiences of Christ, of the house, and of the city. They were firstly deeper in the things of God (Psa. 42), then deeper in the experiences of Christ (Psa. 45), then deeper in the experiences of the city (Psa. 46, 48, and 87), and even the deepest in the experiences of the house (Psa. 84). This is solid confirmation and assurance that one day the Lord will recover all things. One day He will return and reign over the whole earth. The local churches are for that.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 90-THE SAINTS TAKE GOD AS THEIR DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>Now we must go on to Book IV, keeping in mind the message of the first three books. Book IV tells us that the saints, being joined to Christ, are one with God, so that He can recover His title over the earth through Christ in His house and city. This sentence is full of meaning. The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and now He is coming to claim His legal right and title over the whole earth through Christ in the church. This is the message of Book IV.<p>Book IV contains seventeen Psalms, exactly the same number as Book III, and these seventeen are clearly divided into three groups: Psalms 90 to 92, Psalms 93 to 101, and Psalms 102 to 106. Not only are all five books of the Psalms in a wonderful sequence, but each separate Psalm within each book is in good and perfect order. Let us consider now Psalms 90 to 92, the first section of Book IV, which reveal how the saints, identified with Christ, are practically one with God.<p>Psalm 90 tells us something of the deeper experiences of the saints concerning God. Let us compare Psalm 90 with Psalm 1. Psalm 1 says that the man is blessed who keeps the law. But Psalm 90 says, &#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations&#8221; (v. 1). Which one of these Psalms do you prefer? Do you still love Psalm 1? There is no comparison. Psalm 1 ends in this way: &#8220;For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.&#8221; But Psalm 90 concludes by saying, &#8220;And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it&#8221; (v. 17). What a difference! Psalm 90 begins with the Lord as our dwelling place and ends with the beauty of the Lord. This is certainly not the teaching of the law. Psalm 90 tells us that the eternal God is our habitation. We may find in God our everlasting home. A thousand years to Him are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night-a mere two or three hours (v. 4). Such a God is our dwelling place. We may dwell in Him; we may abide under His covering, and thus His beauty will be upon us. It is not a matter of keeping the law, but of taking God as our dwelling place. It is a matter of putting the eternal God upon us as our beauty.<p>&#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place.&#8221; &#8220;Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands.&#8221; If we are in such a position, we are those who are really working for God, and our work will be established by His hands. It is not keeping the ten commandments, but dwelling in God and letting His beauty be upon us. Only thus are we qualified to do His work, and so our work will be established by His hands. This is Psalm 90.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 91-CHRIST TAKES GOD AS HIS DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>From Psalm 90 we go on now to Psalm 91, a Psalm of Christ. It tells us how Christ takes God as His dwelling place and dwells in God. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, Satan quoted Psalm 90. (He knows the Bible much better than we do.) He said, &#8220;If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone&#8221; (Matt. 4:6). He was quoting Psalm 91:11 and 12, and in so doing he proved that Psalm 91 is a Psalm of Christ.<p>Verse 1 of this Psalm says, &#8220;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221; Thus, the saints and Christ are identified as one. The saints take God as their dwelling place, and Christ takes God as His dwelling place. How good! Verses 1 to 13 of this Psalm tell us how Christ takes God as His refuge and trusts in God, and verses 14 to 16 speak of Christ setting His love upon God, calling upon God, and enjoying God&#8217;s presence and deliverance.<h2 class=head1>PSALM 92-THE RESULTS OF TAKING GOD AS OUR DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>Psalm 92 shows the result of taking God as our dwelling place. When we and the Lord Jesus take God as our home, the issue firstly is that we will sing praises. &#8220;It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High&#8221; (v. 1). Only by dwelling in God, by taking God as our habitation, and by letting His beauty be upon us, can we be filled with His praises. This is the first result. The second result is indicated in verse 4: &#8220;For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.&#8221; We must put Psalm 90:17 together with this verse: &#8220;Establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.&#8221; By combining these two portions, we see that to dwell in God as our habitation causes us to realize what the work of God is. Continuing in Psalm 92, we read, &#8220;O Lord, how great are thy works!&#8221; (v. 5). Just to preach the gospel, just to open a mission field, just to pass on some chapters and verses to others and help them to be spiritual is not the great work of God. The great work of God is to restore the desolated building of God and to recover the sons of Korah. The great work of God today is firstly to recover the local churches, and secondly to recover so many of you. Many of us are the real sons of Korah. God&#8217;s great work is to recover the things desolated by Satan. Only by dwelling in His house can we realize this work in all its greatness. Some of you have been in the mission field. Do you still appreciate the mission field work? You must realize something deeper, something greater. In the house of God we may clearly see what are truly the great works of God.<p>&#8220;But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of the wild ox: I shall be mingled with fresh oil.&#8221; (v. 10). So many dear ones who have come into the local churches have experienced their horn being exalted. Before we came to dwell in the churches, we were indeed low and frequently defeated; but when we came into God&#8217;s dwelling place, we sensed that our horn was exalted over our enemies. Formerly, we were afraid of this and afraid of that, but after we came into the local churches, we said, &#8220;Hallelujah, our horns have been exalted!&#8221; We felt then that we were mingled with fresh oil-not only anointed with oil, but mingled with it. The word for &#8220;anointed&#8221; in verse 10 (King James Version) is the same as that in Leviticus 2:4 for &#8220;mingled&#8221;-&#8220;unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil.&#8221; In God&#8217;s house, dwelling in God as our habitation, we have a daily sense of such a mingling with fresh oil. Do you have this kind of feeling? Day by day I sense something so fresh, not just as water, but as oil, being mingled with me. Sometimes people ask how I could be so fresh. It is because I am being daily mingled with fresh oil.<p>&#8220;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God&#8221; (vv. 12-13). When God is our habitation in the local churches, we are like palms and cedars, so stately and secure, planted in the house of God. Have you been planted? If we are planted, we are bound; it is not easy for us to move. But it is here that we flourish. &#8220;They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green&#8221; (v. 14). We flourish to such an extent that even when we are old, we still bring forth fruit; we are full of sap and green. Only by taking God and the local church as our habitation can we do this. God and the local church as our habitation are not two separate things, but one. If we are truly dwelling in the local church, we are certainly dwelling in God; and if we are one with God, surely we are dwelling in the local church. Then we are planted in the divine habitation, flourishing in the courts of our God, and bringing forth fruit even in old age, full of song and praise. The longer we dwell here, the younger we become. This is the result of dwelling in God, and this is Psalm 92.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECOVERY OF GOD&#8217;S TITLE OVER THE EARTH</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 93 to 101</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 93:1, 5;  94:15;  95:1-5; 96:1-4, 6-13; 97:1, 6-9; 98:2-9; 99:1-4, 9; 100:1-4; 101:8</h1><p>These nine Psalms tell of the recovery of God&#8217;s title over the earth through Christ in the house and the city of God. Five times in these Psalms we read, &#8220;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,&#8221; and once, &#8220;Make a loud noise.&#8221; It is marvelous! Why should we make a joyful noise? Because the Lord is coming to reign over the entire earth! Notice how many times in these Psalms the words &#8220;all the earth&#8221; are mentioned. Other words in a similar vein are used as well, such as &#8220;the nations,&#8221; &#8220;the heathen,&#8221; and &#8220;the people,&#8221; or, properly translated, &#8220;the peoples.&#8221; The peoples are the nations. The Psalmists are not referring merely to the Jewish nation, but to all the nations on the face of the earth.<p>It is clear in the first three books that God has accomplished everything through Christ to establish His house and His city for the purpose of possessing the whole earth. Thus, both Book II and Book III end with the reign of Christ over the earth in and through the house and the city. That is wonderful; yet it is still not so adequate. Therefore, we need Book IV.<p>We have already considered the first three Psalms of Book IV, Psalms 90-92. Notice the title of Psalm 90: &#8220;A prayer of Moses, the man of God.&#8221; There is no title for Psalm 91, but Psalm 92 is titled, &#8220;A Psalm or song for the sabbath day.&#8221; It is difficult to determine the authorship of Psalms 91 and 92, but I am certain that Psalm 92 was not written by Moses, and I doubt that Psalm 91 was written by him. My point is that these Psalms, written probably by different authors, were all put together as one group. The subject of this group of Psalms, as we have seen, is the enjoyment of God as our dwelling place, which makes us absolutely one with God. When we take God as our habitation and dwell in Him, we and God are one. We have this concept in John 15: &#8220;Abide in me, and I in you.&#8221; When we abide or dwell in the Lord and let Him abide or dwell in us, it means that we are absolutely and practically one with Him. Psalm 90 speaks of our taking God as our dwelling place, and Psalm 91 speaks of Christ taking God as His dwelling place, thus proving that we and Christ are one. As He is, so are we. In John 17 Christ prays, &#8220;That they may be one in us&#8221; (v. 21). The &#8220;us&#8221; here is composed of the Father and the Son. Thus we are identified with Christ: He and we, we and He, are one, as a great, universal, corporate man, taking God as his dwelling place. This man is now practically one with God: &#8220;I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one&#8221; (v. 23). We are absolutely and completely one with the triune God. Then Psalm 92 tells the issue, the result, of taking God as our habitation. We will praise Him, realize His works, have our horn exalted, and be mingled with fresh oil day by day; then we will be planted in the house of God and flourish in His courts; we will bring forth fruit even in our old age, full of sap and green. It is not a matter of keeping His laws, but of being one with Him, mingling with Him, dwelling in Him, and letting His beauty be upon us, that He might come to recover His title over the whole earth.<h2 class=head1>HOW CHRIST REIGNS AND RECOVERS THE TITLE</h2><p>After the first group of the first three Psalms of Book IV, we have the second group of the next nine Psalms. These nine Psalms are grouped together in a marvelous way. All of them speak about the reigning of Christ and the recovery of the earth&#8217;s title for God.<p>Let us look into the titles of all these Psalms; they are quite interesting. Psalms 93 through 97 have no titles; Psalm 98, just &#8220;Psalm&#8221;; Psalm 99, no title; Psalm 100, just &#8220;A Psalm of praise&#8221;; Psalm 101, &#8220;A Psalm of David.&#8221; It is so clear that these nine Psalms are one group. This group is the central part of Book IV. Books II and III each have just one Psalm which speaks of Christ&#8217;s reign over the whole earth. That is good, but it is not adequate; hence we need all these nine Psalms grouped together as a section to show how God comes to reign over all the earth, over all peoples, to recover His legal rights over the earth.<p>We have seen that with all the Psalms there are five key words, the first on the negative side and the next four on the positive side: the law, Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. In Book I, Christ is revealed adequately. In Book I we also have the house to some extent, with but one verse concerning the city. Book II, however, reveals the house and the city in fullness, and at the end of this book, at its climax, we have the earth. In Book III there is a recovery, a restoration, of the house and the city which had been desolated. Consequently, in Book III we have again Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. However, in all these first three books the earth has not been covered adequately; so we need Book IV. The main part of Book IV is just for the earth. Book IV is the one book of the Psalms which concentrates on the earth. In this book, not much is said concerning Christ, not much regarding the house, very little concerning the city, but very much about the earth, about the reigning of Christ over all the earth to recover its title for God. It is tremendously meaningful. These Psalms of Book IV do mention something concerning Christ, the house, and the city, but here these are not the central point, the main subject. The main point is the recovery of the earth through the reign of Christ. So we see the good sequence of all these books.<p>Psalm 93 tells of Christ&#8217;s reign in majesty and strength: &#8220;The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved&#8221; (v. 1). In Psalm 94 He turns judgment to righteousness: &#8220;But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it&#8221; (v. 15). In the entire earth there is no judgment according to righteousness, but when Christ comes to reign, He will judge the earth in righteousness. He loves justice and establishes equity: &#8220;The king&#8217;s strength also loveth justice; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob&#8221; (Psa. 99:4). There is no country upon this earth in which there is real justice and equity. I have traveled widely throughout the world, and wherever I have gone I have found no justice or equity. I could tell many stories to bear this out. But praise Him, when He returns, He will love justice and establish equity. He is a great King above all, and all the earth and the sea belong to Him: &#8220;For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land&#8221; (Psa. 95:3-5). He will reign at His second coming to judge the world with righteousness and faithfulness; the world will be established; and all things will be joyful, rejoice, and sing praise to Him-Psalm 96:10-13; 97:1; 98:4-9; 96:1-4. All the ends of the earth have seen His salvation; all the people see His glory; all the angels worship Him (Heb. 1:6); and He is exalted above all-Psalm 98:3; 97:6-7, 9.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S REIGN IS IN AND THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THE CITY</h2><p>These nine Psalms show that Christ&#8217;s reigning is in and through the house and the city of God. This is indicated by a number of verses: (1) Holiness is becoming to the house of God-Psalm 93:5. (2) The strength and beauty of Christ are in the sanctuary, and people must give Him glory and come into the courts of God with an offering to worship Him-Psalm 96:6, 8, 9. (3) Christ reigns and is great in Zion; He is high above all the peoples, and the peoples exalt and worship Him in the holy hill of God-Psalm 99:1-2, 9. So, you see, the holy hill of God is really the beachhead to which Christ will return and from which He will reign over the whole earth. (4) All the earth must enter into the gates of God with thanksgiving and into the courts of God with praise to serve Christ-Psalm 100:1-4. (5) All the wicked will be cut off from the city of God-Psalm 101:8.<p>If you read all these Psalms and pray-read all these verses, you will recognize the main point. It is that God is coming to reign in Christ to recover His legal right in the whole earth for the fulfillment of His eternal plan. Now we have come to the consummation. We have seen Christ revealed as the King; we have had the house established and the city built up; now we have the entire earth under God&#8217;s title, with the reigning of Christ in His house and in His city. It is unspeakably marvelous!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE EARTH TURNS TO THE LORD THROUGH ZION</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 102 to 106</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 102:12-16, 19-22, 24-27; 104:35b; 105:45b; 106:1, 47-48</h1><p>Now we come to the last few Psalms of Book IV.<h2 class=head1>A FURTHER REVELATION OF CHRIST</h2><p>Book IV of the Psalms is a short book, and there are just three main points: firstly, how the saints take God as their dwelling place, thus making them practically one with God (Psalms 90 to 92); secondly, the recovery of God&#8217;s title over the earth through Christ in the house and city of God. This second point, though quite simple, is exceedingly strategic. It is nearly the ultimate concept of the whole of the Psalms, and it is the main thought in Book IV. Book I is mainly for Christ and the house; Book II is mainly for Christ and the city; Book III is mainly for the recovery of the house and the city; and Book IV is mainly for the earth. It is vital that we be impressed with all these main points. The third point of Book IV is a further revelation of Christ. Book I has something about Christ, Book II has something more about Christ, Book III has something further concerning Christ, and Book IV has still an additional unfolding of Christ. Eventually, as we will see, Book V also has something concerning Christ. We have seen Christ already in the first section of Book IV: how He was identified with the saints in taking God as His dwelling place. We have also seen Christ in the second section of Book IV: how He is the King to reign over the entire earth for the recovery of God&#8217;s title. Christ is the center: Christ takes God as His dwelling place, and Christ reigns for God over the entire earth.<p>Now at the end of Book IV, we have these five Psalms, Psalms 102 to 106, revealing something more concerning Christ. Psalm 102:25-27 is quoted at the end of Hebrews chapter one, which applies all these verses to Christ. Hence, we see that Psalm 102 is also a Psalm concerning Christ. This Psalm is clearly divided into three sections: the first section, from verse 1 to 11, portrays the sufferings of Christ. This passage depicts Christ&#8217;s suffering in a way in which no other chapter in the entire Bible does. He is the afflicted One, forsaken and cast down by God. When I was a young Christian, verse 7 impressed me deeply: &#8220;I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.&#8221; Christ Himself was continually watching, without sleeping, just as a lonely sparrow on the housetop. The houses in the holy land have flat roofs, and frequently the people go there to pray. Peter was engaged in prayer upon the housetop in Acts chapter ten. We believe that Christ also was there many times, watching, without sleeping, praying to God. This verse shows how Christ behaved in His suffering.<h2 class=head1>ZION&#8217;S STONES AND HER GROUND</h2><p>The second section of Psalm 102, verses 12 to 22, tells us how Christ is the Lord who has mercy upon Zion, who has built up Zion, and who is declared in Zion and praised and served in Jerusalem. The Psalm begins by telling of Christ&#8217;s suffering, and then turns suddenly to the house and the city of God. Verse 13 says, &#8220;Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come.&#8221; I do believe that this was a time when the house and the city were in desolation, and the saints desired to see the restoration. &#8220;For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favor the dust thereof&#8221; (v. 14). Do not forget that this is poetic expression. The stones mentioned here are the believers. And the dust refers to the ground of Zion. The servants of the Lord take pleasure in the members of God&#8217;s house, and they favor her ground. Verse 15: &#8220;So the nations shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.&#8221; Again, you see the relation between the house, the city, and the earth. When the city is in the proper situation before God, then the earth may be gained by the Lord. It is through Zion, through the church, that the nations will turn to the Lord and the kings give glory to the Lord. When we love the church, when we take pleasure in her stones and in her ground, these things will occur. The turning of the earth to the Lord depends upon our attitude toward the house of the Lord.<p>I say again that this is poetry. We must understand what it means to take pleasure in all the stones of Zion and to favor her ground. It is not easy for most Christians to understand these words. I believe that before we came into the local church we could not understand the meaning of favoring the ground of Zion. But today we have the position, and we are in the position to understand this poetry and to have such an experience. We take pleasure in the stones of Zion, and we favor the dust thereof. We are so happy with all the dear ones in the local church, and we are standing upon the ground of the church.<p>Why do the nations &#8220;fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory&#8221;? The answer is in verse 16: &#8220;For the Lord hath built up Zion, he hath appeared in his glory.&#8221; Again we see that when the church is built up, the earth will be gained by the Lord. The nations shall fear the Lord and all the kings give glory to the Lord, for He hath built up Zion and hath appeared in Zion in His glory. For the Lord to take full possession of the earth requires the building up of Zion.<h2 class=head1>DECLARING HIS NAME AND HIS PRAISE</h2><p>Verse 21: &#8220;That men may declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem.&#8221; This verse mainly stresses the city rather than the house. The city is greater than the house, although within it is the house. If we still conduct our meetings in the old way of Christianity with the silence, the pews, the forms, and the special speakers, I do not think that is a declaration of the name of the Lord or of His praise. Rather, when we proclaim, &#8220;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&#8221; we are, at least to some extent, declaring the name of the Lord and His praises. &#8220;Jesus is Lord! Hallelujah!&#8221; This also is a declaration of the name of the Lord and of His praise. Men must declare the name of the Lord in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem.<p>After going through all the Psalms, I cannot find a single verse which says that the house or the city is a place to receive teachings. But there are many verses in the Psalms which tell us that the house or the city of God is the place to praise the Lord. &#8220;Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they will be praising thee all the day long&#8221; (Psa. 84:4). We must not only praise Him, but declare His praises. We must make our praises a kind of declaration.<p>When shall we do this? &#8220;When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord&#8221; (v. 22). Again we see how the Lord needs Zion in order to recover the earth. When men declare the name of the Lord in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem, then the peoples and the kingdoms will be gathered together to serve the Lord. All these verses show us in poetic language how the recovery of the Lord&#8217;s right over the whole earth depends upon the situation of the local churches. It is not a small matter. When we as the local church come together and call, &#8220;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&#8221; it is not a light thing. It is very much related to the Lord&#8217;s recovery and His right over the entire earth.<p>My wife and I were walking a few blocks from the meeting hall one day when a little girl surprised us by saying so sweetly, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; We had never met her before, and she had never met us, yet somehow she knew that we are the &#8220;Hallelujah people.&#8221; Oh, brothers and sisters, let us say more and more, &#8220;Hallelujah,&#8221; and, &#8220;Jesus is Lord.&#8221; Let us declare His name and His praise. We are in the heart of Satan&#8217;s kingdom. To say &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; and &#8220;Jesus is Lord&#8221; in such a place is full of significance and impact.<p>It is due to Christ and the building up of the house of God that peoples will be gathered and the kingdoms will serve the Lord. We all must be turned from the religious concept of keeping the law to Christ Himself, that the house and the city may be built up. Then we may declare His name and His praise, the peoples will be gathered to serve Him, and God&#8217;s legal right over the earth will be recovered.<h2 class=head1>THE ETERNAL ONE</h2><p>The last section of Psalm 102, verses 23 to 28, is concerned with the eternity of Christ. In the first section of this Psalm, He was the suffering and afflicted man, but at the end of the Psalm, He is the eternal One, the very God, from eternity to eternity, the everlasting One, who will never change. &#8220;Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end&#8221; (vv. 25-27).<h2 class=head1>THE HALLELUJAHS BEGUN</h2><p>Following Psalm 102, we have Psalm 103, concerning Christ the Lord as the Redeemer. &#8220;Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies&#8221; (v. 4). Next, in Psalm 104, we see Christ the Lord as the good and kind Creator of so many things. The last two Psalms of Book IV, Psalms 105 and 106, tell us that Christ is the very Lord who has made a covenant with His people, and who is continually dealing with His people according to His covenant. He is the Redeemer (Psalm 103), He is the Creator (Psalm 104), and He is also the Maker and Keeper of the covenant with His people (Psalms 105 and 106).<p>Notice now that by the end of Book IV the &#8220;Hallelujahs&#8221; have begun, with the first instance at the end of Psalm 104. The King James Version reads, &#8220;Praise ye the Lord,&#8221; but in Hebrew it is &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; At the end of Psalm 105 we have another &#8220;Hallelujah,&#8221; and at the beginning of Psalm 106, still another. Then at the end of Psalm 106, that is, at the close of the entire Book IV of the Psalms, there is the fourth &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; has not been used in Book I, nor in Book II, nor even at the end of Book III. At those stages the earth had not yet been fully recovered. But now in Book IV, because the earth has been fully recovered by God, the Psalmists break forth with four &#8220;Hallelujahs.&#8221; Not only has Christ been given His rightful position and the church built up as the house and the city, but the earth has been recovered by the Lord and brought fully under Christ&#8217;s dominion. There is nothing to say but &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; At the end of Psalm 106 we have to say with the Psalmist, &#8220;Amen. Hallelujah!&#8221;<p>Later, in Book V, we will see many more &#8220;Hallelujahs.&#8221; Now we are only at the end of Book IV. But, hallelujah, Christ is here in the church as the house and the city, and the recovery of God&#8217;s title over the earth has been accomplished. Now the earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and all the peoples are gathered with the kingdoms to serve Him. Amen, Hallelujah!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 107 to 110</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 107:31-32; 108:1-3; 109:1, 30; 110:1-7</h1><p>By the end of Book IV we have the consummation, the completion. Everything now has been recovered-Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. We need nothing more. All we need to do is praise. Therefore, Book V, Psalms 107 to 150, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints. Furthermore, it tells us how Christ will come to reign over the entire earth through the house and the city of God. In the first four books of the Psalms, we have Christ, the house, the city, and the earth: now in Book V, the last book, we have the praise, the hallelujahs.<p>Again in Book V, Christ is stressed, not in a deeper way, but rather in a higher way. Book II reveals something of Christ in a deeper way (Psalm 45). But Book V, as we shall see, speaks of Christ in the highest way. Book V emphasizes even more the city of God; it speaks of the city much more than all the other books. It does not refer much to the house, for ultimately the house will disappear. When our brother John saw the new Jerusalem, he mentioned that he saw no temple in the city (Rev. 21:22). When we come to the last book of the Psalms, the temple has all but disappeared; but we do have the city as a high mountain. Eventually and ultimately a local church must become a city. When we come to the end, we will praise God for Christ and the city.<p>Take, for example, the church in Los Angeles. In retrospect, we did have at the beginning the sense of the reality of the house of God. In a very real sense the church life was God&#8217;s house to us. Then gradually, little by little, something of the city began to come forth. There is still something of the house here, but mainly the church life is as a city now. This indicates the improvement of the local church. I do expect that one day the church in Los Angeles will give everyone the impression that it is a city, the city of God.<p>In Book I, as we have seen, there was very little about the city. In Book I we mainly see Christ and the house. Then, both in Book II and in Book III, we have the city with the house. In Book IV we have something added; we see there the city with the house for the earth. Finally, when we come to Book V, we see very little of the house, but we see much of Christ, revealed in such a high way, with the city to possess the earth.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AT GOD&#8217;S RIGHT HAND</h2><p>Now let us consider the first four Psalms of Book V, Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110. In Psalms 107 and 108, the saints thank and praise God for His care, deliverance, and victory through Christ. &#8220;Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!&#8221; (Psalm 107:6-8).<p>In Psalm 109, within the saints in their suffering, we have the cry of Christ to God. (Compare Psalm 109:8 with Acts 1:20.) In Psalm 110 we see the answer, God&#8217;s answer, to Christ&#8217;s cry. This answer is exceedingly high-not deep, but high. Martin Luther said that this Psalm is the greatest of all the Psalms. In a sense, I agree with him. It has only seven verses, just as Psalm 87, that wonderful Psalm regarding the city. Psalm 110, however, is not about the city, but about Christ in the city. It is divided into four sections: (1) the first three verses, (2) verse 4, (3) verses 5 and 6, and (4) verse 7.<p>Verse 1 tells how God makes Christ sit at His right hand: &#8220;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool&#8221; (see Matt. 22:42-45; Acts 2:34-36; Eph. 1:20). Here the title &#8220;the Lord&#8221; is Jehovah in Hebrew. This verse has been quoted frequently in the New Testament-more than ten times as a direct quotation and another ten times indirectly. All together, there are more than twenty instances in the New Testament where Christ is referred to as sitting at the right hand of God. Of course, it was from the time of His ascension that God made Him to sit at His right hand. This is proved by Hebrews 1:3, &#8220;When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.&#8221; He is sitting there until God makes His enemies His footstool. Now we are still in the period of &#8220;until.&#8221; We are still in the time when God is working to bring all enemies under the feet of Christ. This period is the age of the church.<p>Verse 2: &#8220;The Lord shall send the scepter of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.&#8221; We know that this has not yet transpired, but it will come to pass. This means that when God has secured Zion in a full way, Christ will return. Then, out of Zion, God will send forth the scepter of Christ&#8217;s power to rule over all the nations. The day will come.<h2 class=head1>THE SPLENDOR OF CONSECRATION</h2><p>Verse 3: &#8220;Thy people are voluntary offerings in the day of thy power.&#8221; The day of His power is to come. In a sense it has not yet come, but in a spiritual sense we are now in the day of Christ&#8217;s power. As long as we are in the local churches, we are in the day of His power. This is the day when all His people are voluntary offerings. We all need to offer ourselves as voluntary offerings. Young lives offered in this way are exceedingly precious. Are you a voluntary offering? Do you mean it?<p>We have another very significant phrase in verse 3: &#8220;in the splendor of consecration.&#8221; (The &#8220;beauties of holiness&#8221; as in the King James Version should be translated &#8220;in the splendor of consecration.&#8221;) When we consecrate ourselves voluntarily to the Lord, it is a kind of beauty, a splendor. In a recent conference in Los Angeles, the Spirit moved mightily among us, and so many stood to offer themselves in consecration to Christ and the church. We had the sense then of the splendor of consecration.<p>The poetry in this Psalm is marvelous. Verse 3: &#8220;Out of the womb of the morning shall come to thee the dew of thy youth.&#8221; &#8220;Youth&#8221; here refers to young men. This means that all the young people who come to the Lord are just like the dew in the morning. Out of the womb of the morning, young men will come as the dew to Christ. It is so refreshing to Him. Praise the Lord that so many young people today are coming to Christ as the dew of the morning. What a privilege they have in offering themselves to become the refreshing dew to Him! Whether we are old or young does not depend upon our physical age, but upon our spiritual condition. I have been to many places and have seen numerous &#8220;old&#8221; young people and numerous &#8220;young&#8221; old people. We love to see so many &#8220;young&#8221; old folks in our midst. I am among these young men as the dew to Christ out of the womb of the morning. I am not of the womb of the night. We all need to be the voluntary offerings as a refreshing element to the Lord.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IS PRIEST, JUDGE, AND VlCTOR</h2><p>Verse 4: &#8220;The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.&#8221; Christ is not only appointed to be the King, but also ordained as the Priest. He is the King-priest: the King to rule over the nations, and the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek to care for us. To understand fully the meaning of the order of Melchizedek, we must read Hebrews, chapters five, six, and seven.<p>Verse 5: &#8220;The Lord at thy right hand shall smite through kings in the day of his anger.&#8221; The &#8220;Lord&#8221; here is not Jehovah, as in verses 1 and 4, but &#8220;Adonai,&#8221; which means simply &#8220;the Lord.&#8221; It is not God who is mentioned here, but Christ. Christ, at God&#8217;s right hand, shall smite through kings in the day of His anger. This day will come.<p>Verse 6: &#8220;He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall smite through the chief head over a broad land.&#8221; (See Psalm 2:10, 12; Daniel 2:44; Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-21. All these verses show the fulfillment of all these things.) He will smite through kings and His enemies in His anger, and He will judge among the nations. This will happen both at His coming back and at the end of His thousand year reign.<p>Verse 7: &#8220;He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.&#8221; This means, as in verse 3, that Christ also needs refreshing. He needs both the dew in the morning and the fresh water in the way. &#8220;Therefore shall he lift up the head.&#8221; What is this water of the brook from which Christ drinks? Do not forget that this is poetry. According to the context of the entire Psalm, the brook mentioned here must be the saints. While Christ is on His way, while He is fighting through to defeat His enemies, He needs refreshment; He needs a living fountain. He is our living water, and we are His drink. He is our refreshment, and we are His refreshment. We are the dew to Him in the morning, and we are the brook to Him in the daytime, while He is on His way to fight with the enemy. I do believe deeply within my spirit that this is right. Christ is riding on and riding through triumphantly. And on His way, He needs you, He needs me, He needs all of us as a kind of refreshment to Him. We are the dew and the refreshing water to Christ, so that He may lift up His head. Are you willing to be as the dew and as the brook?<h2 class=head1>SUMMARY OF PSALM 110</h2><p>We have covered the first four Psalms of Book V, Psalms 107 to 110. Of these, Psalm 110 is the climax. In fact, no other Psalm is higher than Psalm 110 regarding Christ. It is a short Psalm with only a few main points, but these points are immensely significant. The first is that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. This refers to His exaltation and enthronement. The significance of this verse is seen in the fact that it is mentioned approximately twenty times in the New Testament. Even the Lord Jesus Himself quoted this verse frequently. It is profitable to look into all these New Testament quotations: there are some in the first three Gospels, some in the Acts, some in Ephesians, some in 1 Corinthians, and many in Hebrews.<p>The second point in this Psalm is the victory of Christ. He has won the victory, and He is going to win many more victories. The fact that God has promised to make all His enemies His footstool is an aspect of His victory.<p>The third point is His power, His authority, His scepter. He is the exalted One, the enthroned One, the Victor, and the One who has the scepter. The rod is in His hand (v. 2).<p>The fourth point is that Christ is still fighting, and He will fight to the end. In verse 3 we have this phrase: &#8220;In the day of thy power.&#8221; The word &#8220;power&#8221; in this phrase has another meaning. The margin of the American Standard Version says, &#8220;in the day of thy army,&#8221; and the Goodspeed translation has &#8220;on your day of war.&#8221; It is not only the day of His power, but also the day of His fighting. It is then that the people will offer themselves willingly in the splendor of their consecration. It is then that the young men will be as the dew out of the womb of the morning and as the brook on the way. Christ needs refreshment because He is fighting. On one hand this Psalm tells us He has won the victory, but on the other hand He is still fighting. He will fight to the end. So many things may be realized from this short Psalm.<p>The fifth point is that He is today the Priest. He is the King, He is the Warrior, and He is also the Priest. He is a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but in the power of an endless life (Heb. 7:16). We do not realize how much He prays for us, how much He is sustaining us all the day long, by being our Priest. He is there at God&#8217;s right hand as the King to care for God&#8217;s interest in the entire universe; He is there as the Priest to care for us; and He is also there as the Warrior, fighting against His enemies.<p>The sixth point is that He will eventually return.<p>It is clear, by combining all these six points, that Psalm 110 is the highest peak in the revelation of Christ. Christ today, according to Psalm 110, is at the right hand of God, the highest place in the universe. Hebrews 1:3 says that He &#8220;sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,&#8221; the highest place. Psalm 110 tells us not only where Christ is, but also what He is. He is the King, He is the Victor, He is the Warrior, He is the Priest, and He is the Coming One-at least these five items. In such a short Psalm of seven verses we see all these things. This Psalm, which gives the highest revelation of Christ, is not in the first book, but in the last book of the Psalms. In Book V, we reach the highest peak.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST FOR THE BUILDING</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 111 to 125</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 111:1, 10b; 112:1a; 113:1-3; 115:18b; 116:13, 17-19; 117:1-2; 118:22-24, 26-27; 119:14, 24, 36, 59, 62, 103, 105, 111, 164, 167; 122:1-9; 125:1-2</h1><p>In the preceding chapter we have covered Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110. In this group of four Psalms, Psalm 110 is the climax. No other Psalm is higher regarding Christ than this Psalm. It is very short, and it has only a few main points, but these points are exceedingly significant.<p>Now we come to Psalms 111 through 119, which are full of the saints&#8217; praise to God. We may call these Psalms the &#8220;Hallelujah Psalms.&#8221; Because we have just touched the peak concerning Christ in Psalm 110, we must shout Hallelujah. Hence, the first verse of Psalm 111 begins with Hallelujah, and we have Hallelujahs throughout all these Psalms. These praises are &#8220;in the assembly...and in the congregation&#8221; (Psa. 111:1); &#8220;in the courts of the Lord&#8217;s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah&#8221; (Psa. 116:19).<h2 class=head1>PSALM 118-CHRIST THE CORNERSTONE</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 118, which all Bible teachers recognize as the last Psalm regarding Christ. Do not forget the five points concerning Christ in Psalm 110: He is the enthroned King, the Victor, the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, the Warrior, and the Coming One. This is indeed wonderful, but there is one item missing in Psalm 110: there is no mention of Christ for the building. Now, in Psalm 118 we have Christ for the building presented to us in a marvelous way. Verse 22: &#8220;The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.&#8221; This is just a short verse, but we cannot express how much this verse means to us and to God. It has been used and quoted many times in the New Testament. This is Christ for the building. Christ today is not only the enthroned King, the ordained Priest, the Victor, the Warrior, and the Coming One; He is also the stone that was rejected by the builders. The Jewish nation, the Jewish people, were the builders of God. God used them to build up something upon this earth for Himself, but they rejected the best stone of all. Even the Lord Jesus, when He was on this earth, quoted this verse. He was quite frank. He asked the Jews whether they had read the Scripture in Psalm 118: &#8220;Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord&#8217;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?&#8221; (Matt. 21:42).<p>Today Christ is the stone for God&#8217;s building: &#8220;And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into an holy temple in the Lord&#8221; (Eph. 2:20-21). &#8220;To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious....Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious....Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:4, 6-7). &#8220;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner&#8221; (Acts 4:11). Even Peter before the chief priests said that Christ is made the cornerstone.<p>Included within Christ as the cornerstone are His resurrection, His ascension, His enthronement, and His ordination. He is not only the King and the Priest, but also the stone for God&#8217;s building. In another sense, He is also the Builder; but the point upon which we must now focus is that He Himself is the material for the building. He is the cornerstone, and we are all the other stones produced out of Him. He is the living stone, and we have all been made living stones by Him (1 Pet. 2:4-5). He is the resurrected stone, and in His resurrection we have been made the living stones. Thus, He is not only the building stone, but also the stone for producing many more stones. He is the leading living stone, which produces so many others. Praise the Lord!<p>In Book V, we have primarily these two Psalms concerning Christ, Psalms 110 and 118. These Psalms are at the highest peak. We must worship God for them and thank Him that we have not only Psalm 110, but 118 as well. Without Psalm 118 the record concerning Christ would not be complete. The kingship is for the building, the priesthood is for the building, the victory is for the building, the fighting is for the building, and Christ&#8217;s coming is also for the building. If we have only Psalm 110 without Psalm 118, we simply have the means without the goal. Psalm 118 tells us the goal: the goal is the building.<p>Psalm 118:23, &#8220;This is the Lord&#8217;s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.&#8221; What is the Lord&#8217;s doing? The Jews put Christ upon the cross; they crucified and buried Him, and then they went back to sleep. They thought that everything would go on then as usual, having put that &#8220;troublemaker,&#8221; Jesus, to an end. But then the news suddenly came that He was alive again and that the tomb was empty. He was resurrected and ascended into the heavens, and on the day of Pentecost He proclaimed through His apostles that the same Jesus whom they had crucified was honored by God the Father, raised, exalted, and made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:32-36). The house of Israel was made to know that God had made the stone whom they had rejected the head of the corner. This is the Lord&#8217;s doing. The resurrection, the exaltation, the setting of Christ at the right hand of God and making Him the chief cornerstone is the Lord&#8217;s doing. It is marvelous in our eyes! Did not the Jewish people bury Him? Yes, they did; but now He is at the right hand of God. It is the Lord&#8217;s doing. Hallelujah! Verse 24 continues: &#8220;This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.&#8221; The day referred to in this verse is the day of resurrection. The Lord&#8217;s day is the resurrection day. We must rejoice and be glad on this day. Sunday after Sunday, Lord&#8217;s day after Lord&#8217;s day, we can do nought else but rejoice and be glad.<p>This Psalm concerning Christ does not end here; we still have some additional wonderful verses. Verse 26: &#8220;Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&#8221; Who is this? It is Christ as the coming Messiah; He is the One who will come in the name of the Lord. This verse has been fulfilled once, when Christ entered the gates of Jerusalem while He was on earth. At that time the people laid their garments before Him and shouted, &#8220;Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!&#8221; (Matt. 21:9). But following that, in Matthew 22, the Jewish people rejected Him; and the Lord said unto them, &#8220;Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord&#8221; (Matt. 23:39). In other words, He said, &#8220;Now you reject Me, but one day you will receive Me.&#8221;<p>Psalm 118 closes by indicating how, out of the praising house of the Lord, the blessing comes to the people: &#8220;We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord&#8221; (v. 26). Then, with the praises, a sacrifice is brought to the altar: &#8220;God is the Lord, which hath showed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar&#8221; (v. 27). Lastly, a final note of praise is sounded: &#8220;Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever&#8221; (vv. 28-29).<h2 class=head1>PSALM 119-THE LAW BECOMES THE TESTIMONY</h2><p>Now we proceed to Psalm 119, where the saints praise God for the law as God&#8217;s testimony, a type of Christ. Psalm 119 is the longest Psalm, with 176 verses. It is divided into twenty-two sections, each of eight verses, and each beginning with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Now we have a problem. After all the preceding 118 Psalms, we have another Psalm about the law. The law is still here. But if you compare Psalm 119 with Psalm 1, you will see a great difference. The concept of the Psalmists, as we have mentioned, was greatly influenced by the law. But because they lived in such intimate communion with the Lord, they afforded Him an opportunity to utter something within their utterances, not according to their own concept, but according to His. In Psalm 119 the same principle applies. The author of this Psalm was one hundred percent immersed in the concept of the law, but within His utterance there is the utterance of God.<p>All the verses indicated at the beginning of the chapter show the difference between this Psalm regarding the law and Psalm 1. In Psalm 119 the law is called the testimony, not only the commandment. The testimony here is in the plural number-&#8220;the testimonies.&#8221; The testimonies really mean the law. They are the testimonies of God. The law is the testimony of God; it is much more than a collection of commandments for us to keep. The law is a definition, an explanation, a testimony, showing us the kind of God we have. Hence, in this sense, the law is the testimony as a type of Christ, for Christ is the expression of God, the full revelation of all that God is. In Psalm 119 the word &#8220;testimonies&#8221; is used twenty-three times, once in the singular number. This indicates that the Spirit within the Psalmist is emphasizing Christ. The Psalmist&#8217;s intention was to speak about the law, but the Spirit within him emphasized Christ. Christ is the testimony of God. All the verses we have referred to in this Psalm tell us how the Psalmist appreciated the testimonies, loved the testimonies, and rejoiced in the testimonies. The words of the testimonies were so sweet to him. They were not merely some commandments to keep, but the testimonies of God as an enjoyment to possess. They were not a burden, but a delight to the Psalmist. They were a lamp unto his feet, and a light unto his path.<h2 class=head1>SONGS OF ASCENT</h2><p>Psalms 120 through 134 are called the Psalms of degree, or the songs of ascent. This means that they are the Psalms of ascension, the Psalms of going up. Thus we have the word in Psalm 122:4, &#8220;Whither the tribes go up.&#8221; In all these Psalms the house and the city of God are the center.<p>Let us begin with Psalm 122. I cannot express how much I love this Psalm. &#8220;I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord&#8221; (v. 1). This verse obviously refers to the house. But verse 2 continues by saying, &#8220;Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.&#8221; This then is the city. The Psalm opens with the house, but then proceeds immediately to the city. To enter into the house of the Lord is an exceedingly joyful experience; we may well rejoice. And how good it is to stand within the gates of Jerusalem! Oh, the house and the city! The saints love the city and are glad to go into the house.<p>We do not have such a Psalm as Psalm 122 in Book II. We do have Psalms 46 and 48 in Book II; they are climactic Psalms concerning the city. But those Psalms are not so sweet as this one. How sweet Psalm 122 is! I enjoy it immensely.<p>Verse 3 continues: &#8220;Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together.&#8221; How marvelous! Jerusalem is solidly built; far from being loose, it is compacted together-solid, firm and safe. This is the city of God. Then verse 4: &#8220;Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.&#8221; This verse speaks of the ascent of the Israelites unto Jerusalem. Jerusalem was built upon Mount Zion, at least three thousand feet above sea level. Therefore, whenever the people journeyed to Jerusalem, they must go up. And while they were going up, they sang this Psalm.<p>Verses 5 and 6: &#8220;For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.&#8221; It is so clear: whoever loves Jerusalem will prosper. Remember that this is poetry, and we must understand it in a poetic way. Whoever loves the Lord&#8217;s church as a city will prosper.<p>Verse 7: &#8220;Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.&#8221; The local churches are the palaces. Peace is within their walls for safety, and prosperity is within these palaces for enjoyment. The peace is for safety, and the prosperity is for enjoyment. The peace is within the walls, and the prosperity is within the palaces, and both are within the local churches.<p>Verses 8 and 9: &#8220;For my brethren and companions&#8217; sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.&#8221; Why did the Psalmist love the city? Because the house is there. Because of the house he seeks the good of the city. Now we have the city with the house, and the house with the city. Praise the Lord, this is the church life.<p>Now let us come to Psalm 125. &#8220;They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever&#8221; (v. 1). Zion is immovable; it abides for ever. Then what about Jerusalem? &#8220;As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.&#8221; Zion is safe, and Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains, which means that it is surrounded by God. What more can we say concerning the house and the city in Book V, since so many aspects have already been covered in Book I, Book II, III, and IV? The Psalmist adds this further aspect-Zion is safe, and Jerusalem is surrounded by God. This is the city for the house; this is the church. This is God&#8217;s house, where we enjoy the presence of God; and this is God&#8217;s city, where we have the dominion of God. Praise Him!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE LORD&#8217;S ABUNDANT BLESSING UPON ZION</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 126 to 134</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 126:1-6; 127:1; 128:5; 129:5-8; 132:3-5, 7-8, 11, 13-18; 133:1-3; 134:1-3</h1><p>Book V, as we have seen, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints, and how Christ comes to reign over the whole earth through the house and the city of God. This is the main theme of this book, and this is the ultimate issue of all the books. Now not only do we have Christ, the house, and even the city, but everything is ready for Christ to come, to take over the whole earth, and to reign as the King with His saints through the house and the city. Now what must we do? There is nothing left to do but to praise and shout our hallelujahs. Hence, Book V is a book of hallelujahs, a book of hallelujah Psalms.<p>The first section of Book V is composed of the thirteen Psalms from Psalm 107 to 119. We have seen in this section the two outstanding Psalms of Christ, Psalms 110 and 118. The second section of Book V is composed of the fifteen Psalms of ascent, from Psalm 120 to 134. In this section the house and the city of God are the center. Therefore, in the first section of Book V we reach the highest peak of Christ Himself, whereas in section 2 of Book V the house and the city of God are the focal point. Some say that according to history these Psalms of ascent were sung by the people of Israel while they were ascending from the plain to the mountain of Zion for worship. Others say that these Psalms were used extensively by the captives when they returned from Babylon unto Jerusalem. Whether they were used by one company or the other, both were ascending from a lower place to a higher one; both were going up to Jerusalem, the city of God. From the very content of these fifteen Psalms of ascent, we do have ground to believe that these songs were indeed sung either by the worshippers ascending to Zion or by the captives returning from Babylon.<p>We should never forget Psalms 110 and 118 in the first section of Book V. Neither should we forget Psalm 122 in the second section of Book V, the Psalms of ascension-it is the first precious one in this group. &#8220;I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem&#8221; (vv. 1-2). It is wonderful!<h2 class=head1>THE CAPTIVITY TURNED</h2><p>Now we come to Psalm 126, another outstanding Psalm in this section. It opens in this way: &#8220;When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream&#8221; (v. 1). The turning of their captivity was like a dream because it was too good, too great, too wonderful, and it occurred so quickly. You remember the account of Peter&#8217;s release from prison in Acts 12. When he came to the door of Mary&#8217;s house, the people reacted as if they were in a dream. It seemed too good to be true. Peter himself, when he was first released, imagined that he was in a dream. But the release of Peter from prison is quite insignificant when compared with the return of the captivity. Many times when I have considered the recovery of the church life I also have felt as if I were in a dream. It is so good. We never expected it, and it came so quickly. I believe that many of you feel this way also. You would say, &#8220;Now I am in the church life! Two years ago I would never have thought I would be here, and even a few months ago I never imagined this. But, hallelujah, here I am. I must be dreaming!&#8221; It is too wonderful; it is too sweet; it is something which has transpired so quickly and unexpectedly. Hallelujah, we are the returned captivity, and we are all in a wonderful dream. Yet, praise the Lord, it is so real! The Lord has turned the captivity of Zion.<p>The Psalmist continues, &#8220;Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad&#8221; (vv. 2-3). The saints rejoiced with singing for the return of the captivity. It was a great thing the Lord did for them. But the returned ones were still not satisfied. Something had taken place as in a dream, but they still needed more turning. Therefore verse 4 says, &#8220;Turn our captivity, O Lord.&#8221; It is as if the Psalmist were saying, &#8220;We are just partly turned; a great part is not turned yet. We may rejoice for ourselves, but we must cry to the Lord for others.&#8221; A great part of the captivity has not yet been turned. &#8220;Turn our captivity, O Lord,&#8221; as the streams restored and as the sheaves brought in.<p>For many years I was familiar with the last two verses of Psalm 126: &#8220;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for scattering, shall come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him&#8221; (vv. 5-6). I never realized, however, that these two verses are the Psalmist&#8217;s words for the return of the captivity. When we cry to the Lord to turn our captivity, the tears flow down. Many dear saints in ancient times experienced this. They wept as they prayed for the return of the captivity. Then they went out to sow the seed, the seed of turning, the seed of recovery.<p>In the opening chapters of Ezra the names of a good number of returning ones are recorded. But Ezra was not included in this group. It was years later that Ezra and others returned to Jerusalem. After the first group returned from captivity unto Jerusalem, there should be another group to follow them out of captivity. Therefore, those who first returned sowed the seed of the recovery with tears. Then the day came when another group returned as the bringing in of dried sheaves from a dry land. So many returned to Jerusalem with the sheaves of the returned people. We must read these two verses in such a context.<p>Today we can shout Hallelujah for such a dream as in verse 1. We are in the local church life! But look at the situation: thousands of the Lord&#8217;s people are still in captivity. What shall we do? We may shout for ourselves, but we must weep for them. We must sow the seed of recovery with weeping. The captivity is just as the dried sheaves; therefore we must water the captivity with our tears. If we do, it will not be long before more captives will be brought into the church life just as the bundles of sheaves.<p>What about the city where you live? Are there not many still in captivity? Do you not need to be burdened as a sower to sow the seed of the Lord&#8217;s recovery? We all should be so burdened; we all should weep with tears saying, &#8220;Lord, turn the captivity just as the restoration of dried sheaves in a dry land.&#8221; If we sow like this, we will soon come with rejoicing, bringing our sheaves with us. We will come to the next conference with sheaves. They that sow with tears shall reap with joy. The sheaves will be brought to the temple of God as firstfruits.<h2 class=head1>BLESSING IS RELATED TO ZION</h2><p>Psalm 127:1, &#8220;Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.&#8221; For years I was troubled by this verse. Now I understand it. All the returned captives will say, &#8220;Lord, now we have learned by our experiences that except You build the house, we labor in vain; except You keep the city, the watchman is useless. By the desolation, by the captivity, we have really learned that we are nothing, and You are everything. For the building up of the house, we trust in You; we can do nothing. For the keeping of the city, we trust in You. From all the captivity, from all the failures, we have come to know the Lord, we have learned to put our trust in Him.&#8221; The returned people praised the Lord with Psalm 127. May we today also praise the Lord in this way. We must put our trust in Him and praise Him by saying, &#8220;Lord, unless You accomplish the recovery, we can do nothing; unless You build, we can do nothing; unless You keep, we can do nothing.&#8221; Praise the Lord!<p>Now let us go on to Psalm 128:5, &#8220;The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s blessing is out of Zion, and the good is of the city Jerusalem. In these Psalms of ascension, the concept is always of Zion, Jerusalem, the house and the city. &#8220;Thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem (the good of the city) all the days of thy life.&#8221; All my expectation is that I may see the good of the local churches as the city all the days of my life. I have been seeing it for forty years now, and I hope to see it until the day I shall see Him. The Lord bless thee, brothers; the Lord bless thee, sisters, out of the local churches! O what a blessing it is to see the good of the local churches all the days of our life! We have only tasted a little, but according to this taste, suppose that there should be no more church life. I believe that many of us would be weeping. What a barren desert that would be! But, praise the Lord, we are in God&#8217;s recovery; we are living in the local churches.<p>Now let us go on to Psalm 129. Here we have a contrast. Psalm 129 is a negative Psalm, yet it helps to enhance the city. Verse 5, &#8220;Let them all be put to shame and turned backward that hate Zion.&#8221; These are the real backsliders. The hate of Zion brings in shame and turning backward. Anyone who hates the local churches will be put to shame and turned backward. I have witnessed many like this. In my entire Christian life I have never seen one Christian who, when he criticized and opposed the local churches, was ever blessed by the Lord from that time forth. I have observed that all those who have opposed the church life have become backsliders. There has not been one exception. Let them all be put to shame and turned backward. It is not a small thing. The Psalmist continues, &#8220;Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth before it groweth up: wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom&#8221; (vv. 6-7). If you hate the local churches, you will have no more growth of life. There will be no rich reaping and no rich harvest. &#8220;Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we bless you in the name of the Lord&#8221; (v. 8). No growth, no rich harvest, no blessing.<p>We who have been in the church life in Los Angeles over the past years may look back over our history and see the condition of those who have opposed the local church. There is only shame and backsliding-no growth, no rich harvest, and no blessing. The Lord will vindicate Himself. He is for Zion; if you hate Zion, you are through. The Lord desires Zion. If you reject it, it is not a small thing, it is not a matter of doctrinal disputation. Let them all be put to shame and turned backward that hate Zion.<p>Now let us go on from this negative Psalm to a positive one, Psalm 132. In Psalm 129 we have the haters of Zion, but in Psalm 132 we see the lovers of God&#8217;s dwelling place. David is the representative. He says, &#8220;Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob&#8221; (vv. 3-5). This means that he would not rest until the Lord obtained rest. If the Lord was homeless, David was homeless; if the Lord was wandering, he was wandering. David was referring to a situation which existed in his time, but this also was a kind of recovery. The ark had been removed from the tabernacle and captured by the enemy. And even when the ark was returned to the children of Israel, it was not yet put into its proper place, the tabernacle. A full recovery was needed. David was one who loved God so deeply, one who was devoted to God&#8217;s resting place, to God&#8217;s habitation. He said that he would not enter his house until the Lord could find a habitation; he would not take sleep until the Lord should find rest.<p>Verses 7 and 8: &#8220;We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.&#8221; This is figurative of the recovery of the church life. The ark was separated from the tabernacle, which signifies Christ separated from the church life. Christ was with the church, but Christ has been separated from the church. This is the time when we must all say, &#8220;Lord, arise; return into Your resting place, the local churches.&#8221;<p>Verse 13: &#8220;For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.&#8221; Zion, which represents the local churches, is the choice of God, the desire of God. This word in verse 13 is the word of the Psalmist, but when we continue into verse 14, we see that it is also the word of the Lord Himself: &#8220;This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.&#8221; While the Psalmist was speaking in verse 13, the Lord suddenly intervened to speak Himself in verse 14. David had said, &#8220;For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.&#8221; Then the Lord immediately continued, &#8220;This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.&#8221; This is the wonderful way in which the Psalms were written.<p>The Lord Himself spoke further concerning Zion, &#8220;I will enrich her food supplies: I will satisfy her needy ones with bread&#8221; (v. 15). This word exactly fits our present situation. When we come into the local churches, we sense that here we have an abundant food supply. We are enriched. We are the needy ones, yet we have found bread. Are you still hungry? If you come into the local churches, you will be satisfied. Hallelujah, there is a place today where the hungry and needy ones may be fed and fully satisfied!<p>Here in Zion the Lord not only satisfies us with food, but also supplies us with clothing: &#8220;I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy&#8221; (v. 16). This salvation is not just a salvation from hell, but a salvation to the uttermost, a salvation of life. &#8220;Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life&#8221; (Rom. 5:10). The Lord today is still clothing us with this wonderful life-salvation of His. He is satisfying us with the bread, and He is clothing us with the salvation of life. Day by day we are being saved. What then shall we do? We can do nought else but shout aloud for joy. We have a rich supply of food and glorious clothing. Hallelujah!<p>The Lord continues: &#8220;There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed&#8221; (v. 17). We not only have food and clothing, but also a horn, the figure of strength, power and victory. Furthermore, we have a lamp; we are not in darkness. And there is yet more: &#8220;His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish&#8221; (v. 18). The word &#8220;flourish&#8221; here may be translated &#8220;shine.&#8221; &#8220;Upon himself shall his crown shine.&#8221; Many times in the church life I have the sense of a shining crown upon me. I have rich food, I have glorious clothing, I have a horn, a lamp, and a shining crown. Then what about the enemies? The Lord clothes us with salvation, but He clothes the enemies with shame.<p>All this occurs in the house and in the city. The house is God&#8217;s choice, God&#8217;s desire, and God&#8217;s satisfaction. In the house God satisfies us and clothes us; so we have both satisfaction and beautification. In the local churches we have the horn, the lamp, and the crown; and here we see the enemies put to shame day by day. It is really good!<p>Therefore, as typified in this Psalm, there is so much in the local churches: the desire and choice of God, the rest and satisfaction of God, the Christ (the ark) of God&#8217;s strength, the throne of the Anointed (Christ), the rich food supply, the clothing of the priests, the worship and joyful shout of the saints, the horn, the lamp, the crown of God&#8217;s Anointed (Christ), and the defeat and shame of the enemies. Here Christ, the house, and the city are joined together.<h2 class=head1>THE BLESSEDNESS OF UNITY</h2><p>After such a wonderful Psalm as Psalm 132, we see a wonderful church life, the wonderful life of the brethren living together in unity. &#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221; (Psa. 133:1). No one can explain how truly wonderful this is. You can only come and experience it yourself. To hear about it is not sufficient; to read and learn of it is not adequate; you simply must &#8220;come and see.&#8221; I am so very happy that nearly all the dear ones who have come and have seen have been captured. &#8220;Behold, how good!&#8221; Just behold! If you would like to know what is going on in the church in Los Angeles, you had better come and see. It is marvelous!<p>&#8220;It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#8217;s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments&#8221; (v. 2). The unity is like the precious ointment. This ointment is the Spirit, the Spirit which includes all that Christ is and all He has accomplished. It runs down from the Head to the entire Body. Now, praise the Lord, we are under His skirt. Since we are all His members, we are all under His skirt, under His garments. Hence, we all partake of the anointing ointment. This is a picture of the Body.<p>Another aspect of the unity is that it is like the dew of Hermon which descends upon the mountains of Zion. Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, the highest place, from which the dew descends. The mountains are the local churches, and the dew is the refreshing Christ. In Psalm 110 we are the dew to Christ, but here in Psalm 133 Christ is the dew to the church. Praise the Lord, we are His refreshment, and He is ours. Day by day He is refreshed by us, and we are refreshed by Him. The refreshing element of Christ comes down upon all the local churches. Sometimes when we are in the meetings late in the evening, we experience the refreshing dew as in the dawn of the morning. Many times we are very tired in body, but tremendously refreshed in spirit. We would like the meetings to continue through the entire night. Such unity is as the dew of Hermon that descends upon the mountains of Zion. It is not only as ointment upon the Body of Christ, but also as heavenly dew upon the local churches for our enjoyment. It is not only a Body life, but also a local church life. Hallelujah for such unity!<p>It is here, in such a place of unity, that &#8220;the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore&#8221; (v. 3). Note that it does not say &#8220;the Lord gave the blessing,&#8221; but &#8220;the Lord commanded the blessing.&#8221; The blessing is life, fullness of life, for evermore. How glad we are to hear of the local churches being full of life. This is the fulfillment of Psalm 133. Where the brethren are dwelling together in unity, the Lord commands the blessing, even life for evermore. The beauty, the joy, and the blessing of the unity of God&#8217;s people are with the Body of Christ and in the local churches.<p>We have one further Psalm of ascension, Psalm 134. Both Psalm 133 and 134 have only three verses. They are short Psalms, but how precious! Never before have I appreciated Psalm 134 as much as I do today. Psalm 133 is a continuation of Psalm 132, and Psalm 134 is the conclusion of Psalm 133. By the close of Psalm 132 God enters into His rest, and we obtain satisfaction in the habitation of God. Hence, following that, we have the church life in Psalm 133. Psalm 134 now is a conclusion to that wonderful church life presented in Psalm 133. &#8220;Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord&#8221; (vv. 1-2). This was the word of the people to the priests. All the people were telling the priests, &#8220;All ye servants of the Lord, you must bless the Lord.&#8221; Then the last verse of Psalm 134 is the answer, the reply, of the priests to the people: &#8220;The Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.&#8221; God&#8217;s servants bless Him in His house, and God blesses His people out of Zion. This little Psalm means that we all must fellowship and communicate in this way. After a good meeting, after a rich enjoyment of Christ, some of us may say, &#8220;Bless the name of the Lord.&#8221; Then others may answer, &#8220;The Lord bless you out of Zion.&#8221; How blessed! Let us try it. This is a good fellowship, a good communication, a good conclusion to a meeting of the church.<p>Hallelujah for the church life!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SAINTS&#8217; PRAISE TURNS TO THE KINGDOM</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 135 to 145</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 135:1-3, 21; 136:1-3; 137:1-9; 138:1-2, 4-5; 139:7, 17; 140:7; 142:5; 143:6, 10; 144:9; 145:1-6, 10-13, 18, 21</h1><p>The main Psalms of Book V that we have covered so far are Psalms 110 and 118 concerning Christ, Psalms 122, 126, and 132 concerning the house and the city, and Psalms 133 and 134 regarding the life in the house and in the city, that is, the life or the living of unity. I advise the young brothers and sisters to memorize all these Psalms.<p>With all these main Psalms and main points as a background, we come to the next group of psalms in Book V, Psalms 135 to 145. In these, the saints&#8217; praise to God in the house and the city of God eventually turns to the reigning Christ and His Kingdom. There are eleven Psalms to cover this point.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING</h2><p>Psalm 135 opens with Hallelujah. Surely, whenever a Psalm begins in this way, it must contain something marvelous. &#8220;Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, praise the Lord&#8221; (vv. 1-3). God&#8217;s servants have to praise Him in His house. Bear in mind that these verses are an exhortation to the saints in ancient times, in the Old Testament. If these verses were written for them, how much more should they be applied to us! If in ancient times the saints should praise God in such a way, how much more should we! How greatly we have been led astray by Christianity! I have been a Christian for many years, but no one has ever told me that I must praise God like this. I was continually taught and even trained to be silent. Oh, the deplorable teaching of Christianity today concerning silence! &#8220;Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, praise the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.&#8221; I can still remember attending the meetings in that kind of Christianity: I never felt free to laugh or rejoice; I was always careful to keep a sober face and not disturb the hushed atmosphere. But Psalm 135:3 says that to praise the Lord is pleasant. Oh, it is really pleasant to praise the Lord!<p>Psalm 135 closes with this verse: &#8220;Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah&#8221; (v. 21). In Psalm 134 we have, &#8220;The Lord bless thee out of Zion,&#8221; but in Psalm 135 we have, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord out of Zion.&#8221; The Lord who dwells at Jerusalem is blessed out of Zion. The last word in Psalm 135 is &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; Psalm 135 begins with Hallelujah and ends with Hallelujah.<p>Now we come to Psalm 136. &#8220;O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever&#8221; (v. 1). To give Him praise is one thing, and to give Him thanks is another. We must give Him both praise and thanks. &#8220;O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever&#8221; (vv. 2-3). The Psalmist here gives thanks to the Lord, the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, for His mercy endureth for ever. What can we do but just give Him thanks.<h2 class=head1>SWEET REMEMBRANCE OF CAPTIVITY</h2><p>Now we have another wonderful Psalm, Psalm 137, one which we should never forget. This is a Psalm regarding the remembrance of the experience of desolation, the remembrance of the experience of captivity. What I am about to say may sound strange to you, but please try to understand me. We must believe that our Lord is really sovereign. Since He is sovereign, if He had never allowed us to be captured, we could never be captured. Though we had attempted to be led into captivity, unless He had allowed it, it could not have been accomplished. He is sovereign, and all His people were brought into captivity. So many of us have had the same experience as the Psalmist in Psalm 137. But we can even praise the Lord that we have been captured! In eternity, when we recall how we failed the Lord so miserably, how we were captured, and how the Lord eventually brought us back, the remembrance will be sweet. Do you not agree with me? When the captives of old returned, when they were enjoying the Lord together in His house, they reminisced concerning their time in captivity: &#8220;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion&#8221; (v. 1). This kind of remembrance is so sweet. Though the Lord allowed us to be captured, it was for our ultimate enjoyment. Many times when I have spoken concerning my experience in Christianity, I have bowed and worshipped the Lord and told Him, &#8220;Lord, without that experience I could never have realized how sweet your house is.&#8221; If we have never fallen and been brought back, we have never tasted the sweetness of the Lord&#8217;s mercy in restoring us. Even that kind of failure and captivity is sovereignly a part of the Lord&#8217;s own economy. Just recall all your experiences throughout the past two years, and you will taste something of this sweetness.<p>Let us read this Psalm. It shows how much Zion and Jerusalem were to the captives. I am much inferior to the Psalmist; I could not utter anything better than he did-it is really poetic. &#8220;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.&#8221; Zion was in the remembrance of the captives. When they remembered Zion, the tears flowed. There they were at some other rivers; they were not drinking at the river of the house of God, the river which makes glad the city of God. They were sitting by the rivers of captivity, and when they remembered Zion, they wept. &#8220;We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof&#8221; (v. 2). We went on strike. We shut our mouths. This was prison; this was not the place for us to worship. How meaningful! To sing praises to the Lord requires a certain place. How can we sing praises to the Lord in Babylon? We cannot play our harps in Babylon. The only thing we can do in Babylon is weep. How significant! &#8220;For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and our tormentors required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion&#8221; (v. 3). To sing one of the songs of Zion in Babylon would be a real shame to the Lord. So the saints said, &#8220;How shall we sing the Lord&#8217;s song in a foreign land?&#8221; (v. 4). It is really good! I could never utter anything better than this.<p>Verses 5 and 6: &#8220;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her skill. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.&#8221; The Psalmist was saying, &#8220;If I would not strike, let my tongue and my hands strike. If I would not hang up my harp, let my tongue and my right hand be hung up. Jerusalem is not only my chief joy, but better than my chief joy. It is something which is better than the best.&#8221;<p>Psalm 137 is the sweet remembrance of the sorrowful experience of captivity. When we are in eternity, we will never forget all those experiences of Babylon.<p>Verse 7: &#8220;Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.&#8221; This is poetry, but according to the present situation, the principle is exactly the same. You simply do not know how much some of the so-called Christians (I do not say the unbelievers) hate the church life today. They hate the recovery of the local church. If the church in Los Angeles would close today, so many would clap their hands. Their desire is expressed in the words, &#8220;Rase it, rase it, even to the foundations thereof! Get rid of the whole thing.&#8221;<p>Verse 8: &#8220;O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rendereth unto thee as thou hast meted out to us.&#8221; In the book of Revelation we read of the rejoicing that occurs when Babylon is fallen: &#8220;And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen&#8221; (Rev. 18:2). &#8220;And again they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever&#8221; (Rev. 19:3). &#8220;Happy shall he be, that rendereth unto thee as thou hast meted out to us.&#8221; This is the vengeance of God. Time will vindicate His word. The enemy of Jerusalem is to be punished and Babylon is to be destroyed. Babylon will fall, but Jerusalem will stand forever. Regardless of how much the haters say of Jerusalem, &#8220;Rase it, rase it,&#8221; we and God are saying, &#8220;Build it! Build it!&#8221; Eventually Babylon will be rased, and Jerusalem will be built twelve thousand furlongs high. Jerusalem will stand forever. Hallelujah, praise the Lord!<h2 class=head1>PRAISE FOR THE CHURCH</h2><p>Now we must go on to Psalm 138. &#8220;I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name&#8221; (vv. 1-2). The Psalmist says, &#8220;I will worship toward thy holy temple.&#8221; At this point, all that was in the Psalmist was the house and the city. In these last few Psalms how many times the Psalmist has referred to Zion and Jerusalem! &#8220;Blessed be the Lord out of Zion.&#8221; &#8220;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem....&#8221; &#8220;If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.&#8221; The Psalmist was fully and thoroughly occupied by the experience of the house and the city. In the entire universe nothing was so precious. In the recovery of the church life you and I will come to such a stage. Day by day we will say, &#8220;Oh, the church! Praise the Lord for the church! Oh, look at the church! How much I prefer the church above my chief joy! I worship God for the church.&#8221; May the Lord bring us all to such a stage.<p>Verse 4: &#8220;All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord.&#8221; After the house and the city have been established, all the kings of the earth praise the Lord when they hear the words of His mouth. &#8220;Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord&#8221; (v. 5). That means that they will praise the Lord&#8217;s way, the Lord&#8217;s doing. They will say, &#8220;Great is the glory of the Lord.&#8221; This is the reigning of Christ; this is the Kingdom of Christ, with Christ Himself reigning over the entire earth. In that day, all the kings of the earth shall praise Him, they shall sing praises regarding the way of the Lord, and they will say, &#8220;Great is the glory of the Lord!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS CONTINUE TO ENJOY GOD</h2><p>In the meantime, while the saints were praising concerning the house and city of God, they were still in the enjoyment of God. We have read Psalm 136, verses 1 to 3, concerning giving thanks unto the Lord, the God of gods and the Lord of lords, for His enduring mercy. Undoubtedly that is a kind of enjoyment of God.<p>Psalm 139:7 says, &#8220;Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?&#8221; The saints here were enjoying the Lord&#8217;s presence. It is clear from this verse that the Lord&#8217;s presence is simply the Spirit. I just cannot escape from this presence of His. What enjoyment this is! Hence, verses 17 and 18 say, &#8220;How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.&#8221; Oh, the thoughts of the Lord are so precious to us! We cannot tell how many thoughts the Lord has toward us, and all of them are so exceedingly great and precious. These verses tell us poetically how the saints, while they were praising the Lord for His move through the city to the earth, were still in the enjoyment of God. &#8220;When I awake, I am still with thee&#8221;-this is the enjoyment of God.<p>Psalm 140:7, &#8220;O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.&#8221; The Psalmist spoke of the Lord as his helmet of salvation, his protection in the battle. We are still in the day of battle, but, praise the Lord, we are under His covering. He Himself is the helmet which covers our head in such a day. This is the enjoyment of God.<p>Psalm 142:5, &#8220;I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.&#8221; While they were praising the Lord, they were still enjoying the Lord. Don&#8217;t wait until you die to praise the Lord. If you praise Him in the land of the dead, I do not think that praise will be so sweet. Praise the Lord, He is our portion today; He is our portion in the land of the living. When I was young, I was taught that today we must suffer a little, we must be patient and wait till we are brought to a wonderful place called heaven. In a sense, that is not wrong; but we must realize that within today&#8217;s sufferings there is more enjoyment. In today&#8217;s trials the Lord is our sweet portion. O Lord, thou art our portion today in the land of the living. Praise the Lord!<p>Psalm 143:6, &#8220;I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land.&#8221; The Psalmist is saying, &#8220;I am dry, but I am not in a dry place. I am thirsty, but the place where I am is not thirsty; it is a place full of water.&#8221; Then verse 10: &#8220;Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy Spirit is good; lead me into a plain country.&#8221; The plain country here means an even land, a place where nothing is unbalanced. Praise the Lord, if we are under His good Spirit, He will continually lead us to an even land, a plain country. Even though we may be subjected to some form of suffering on one hand, we will be balanced on the other hand by our enjoyment of God. On one hand we may sense our poverty, but on the other hand we will realize that we are so rich in Christ. If we had only the riches without the poverty, we could not be so even. Praise the Lord, we are in an even land. The land where we are spiritually, under the leading of God&#8217;s Spirit, is really a plain country. &#8220;Thy Spirit is good; lead me into a plain country.&#8221; This is the saint&#8217;s enjoyment of God.<p>Psalm 145:18, &#8220;The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.&#8221; This corresponds exactly with Romans 10: &#8220;Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)... The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.... For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221; (vv. 6-8, 13). We need not ascend to the heavens to bring Christ down; neither need we descend to hell to bring Him up. He is so near to us, even in our mouth and in our heart. All we need to do is call upon Him in truth, in reality. How good!<h2 class=head1>PRAISE FOR THE KING AND THE KINGDOM</h2><p>Psalm 145 tells how the saints praise God for His reigning in Christ and His Kingdom. Verse 1 indicates that God is the King in Christ: &#8220;I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.&#8221; To extol is higher and deeper than to praise. Here the Psalmist extols Christ as the King. Verses 10 to 13 reveal that God&#8217;s Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom with glory and majesty: &#8220;All thy works (all things on this earth) shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power (power now comes from the city to the kingdom); to make known to the sons of men (all peoples, races, and nations in the entire earth) his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.&#8221; Now you can see how the praises of the Psalmists have turned to the reigning Christ and His Kingdom. In all the previous Psalms the praises have been mostly occupied with Christ, the house, and then the city. Now the praise concerns the reigning Christ and His glorious Kingdom over the entire earth. &#8220;Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations&#8221; (v. 13).<p>Now verse 21: &#8220;My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.&#8221; What can we do now but use our mouth to praise the Lord. Do not tell me that there is no need to shout, that you need only praise the Lord from within. The Psalmist says here, &#8220;My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord.&#8221; You must use your mouth. &#8220;And let all flesh (the human race, all people) bless his holy name for ever and ever.&#8221; My mouth shall speak His glory, and all flesh shall bless His holy name through all eternity.<p>We must never forget these Psalms concerning Christ, concerning the house and the city, concerning the life of unity, and now concerning the Kingdom:<ol class="none"><li>Psalms 110, 118 -<br>Christ</li><li>Psalms 122, 126, 132 -<br>the house and the city</li><li>Psalms 133, 134 -<br>the life of unity</li><li>Psalms 137 to 145 -<br>the Kingdom</li></ol><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CONSUMMATE PRAISE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 146 to 150</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 146:1-2, 10; 147:1-2a, 12-14, 20b; 148:1-5, 7a, 11-14; 149:1-3, 5-9; 150:1-6; Rev. 19:1-9</h1><p>After passing through the first one hundred and forty-five Psalms, we are now on the peak. All we have to do now is to shout &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; The last five Psalms-146, 147, 148, 149, and 150-begin and end in every case with Hallelujah. In these five Psalms there are ten instances of Hallelujahs. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah! In these five Psalms, nothing new is presented. There is only praise, consummate praise.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE FOR THE CITY AND FOR THE LORD&#8217;S REIGN</h2><p>Firstly there is praise in Psalm 146 for God&#8217;s reigning in Christ through Zion. &#8220;Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being&#8221; (vv. 1-2). Regardless of what kind of being I am, though I am weak or strong, I will still sing praises to God. In verse 10 the Psalmist gives the reason for his praise: &#8220;The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.&#8221; This is the main point of Psalm 146. &#8220;The Lord shall reign for ever...O Zion.&#8221; Zion is the city, and the Lord&#8217;s reigning is for the earth. There is nothing new; there is just praise for the city and for the Lord&#8217;s reign in the earth. This is Psalm 146.<p>In Psalm 147 we have praise for God&#8217;s building of Jerusalem: &#8220;Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem&#8221; (vv. 1-2a). Again we have praise for the city. Verse 7: &#8220;Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God.&#8221; Verse 12: &#8220;Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.&#8221; It does not say, &#8220;Praise the Lord, O saints,&#8221; or, &#8220;Praise thy God, O David.&#8221; It says, &#8220;Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.&#8221; This is the city. Verses 13 and 14: &#8220;For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.&#8221; Here in the city we have the strengthening, the blessing, the peacemaking, and an abundant supply of the best food. Then in the last part of verse 20 we have, &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; Hallelujah for the city! Hallelujah for Jerusalem! Hallelujah for Zion! Hallelujah for the strengthening of the bars of the gates! Hallelujah for the blessing of all the children within the gates! Hallelujah for peace in the city! Hallelujah for the rich and best food! Psalm 147 is a Psalm of the city. It is really marvelous.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE FROM THE HEAVENS TO THE EARTH</h2><p>In Psalm 148 the praise starts from the heavens and transfers to the earth. &#8220;Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord&#8221; (vv. 1-5). In verses 7 and 11 to 14 the praise moves to the earth: &#8220;Praise the Lord from the earth...Kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. (Now Psalm 8 is fulfilled: &#8216;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.&#8217;) He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.&#8221; Verse 14 mentions that the Lord exalts two things: the horn of His people, and the praise of all His saints. Do not say that we are too loud in our praising. When we praise, the Lord exalts our praises. We must be even more loud in extolling Him, &#8220;for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.&#8221; There are no new points in Psalm 148. It is a Psalm of praise beginning from the heavens and coming to the earth.<p>Psalm 149 is another Psalm concerning the city and the earth. &#8220;Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King&#8221; (vv. 1-2). Zion is the city, and the King (Christ) is for the earth. Verses 3 and 5: &#8220;Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp...Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.&#8221; The saints are joyful in glory because now they are in the Kingdom, now they are reigning. Let them sing aloud upon their beds-in the night, not only in the day; in the bedroom, not only in the living room or in the meeting hall. &#8220;Let the high praises of God be in their mouth (not the low praises), and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honor have all his saints. Hallelujah&#8221; (vv. 6-9). At this time the saints are reigning over the earth and executing the judgment of the Lord. Again, there is no new concept presented in this Psalm. Psalm 149 is another Psalm of the city and of the earth.<p>These last five Psalms are all Psalms of praise for the house, the city and the earth, and mostly for the city, because it has come to its ultimate consummation. Revelation 21 describes the final scene in the entire Bible-it is a revelation of the city for the earth, the New Jerusalem and the earth, with all the kings bringing their presents into it. Eventually we just have the city and the earth.<h2 class=head1>ALL PRAISE</h2><p>Finally we come to Psalm 150: &#8220;Hallelujah, praise the Lord, praise the Lord!&#8221; In this Psalm we have ten different ways to praise the Lord: (1) &#8220;Hallelujah. Praise God in his sanctuary.&#8221; We must praise Him in the church, in the sanctuary; (2) &#8220;Praise him in the firmament of his power&#8221;; (3) &#8220;Praise him for his mighty acts&#8221;; (4) &#8220;Praise him according to his excellent greatness&#8221;; (5) &#8220;Praise him with the sound of the trumpet&#8221;; (6) &#8220;Praise him with the psaltery and harp&#8221;; (7) &#8220;Praise him with the timbrel and dance&#8221;; (8) &#8220;Praise him with stringed instruments and organs&#8221;; (9) &#8220;Praise him upon the loud cymbals&#8221;; (10) &#8220;Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.&#8221; Then the Psalmist exclaims, &#8220;Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.&#8221; Of all the ten ways to praise Him, notice that the first is to praise Him in His sanctuary, His house. Hence, Psalm 150 is a Psalm for the house. Praise the Lord, at the close of the Psalms we are left in the &#8220;hallelujah house.&#8221;<p>Psalm 150 is not merely the conclusion of the Psalms; it is the consummation of the entire Bible. The whole Bible ends in this way. When we have read all the Psalms, from Psalm 1 to Psalm 150, we have read from Genesis to Revelation in abbreviated form, passing from the law, to Christ, to the house, and eventually to the city with the earth. Then we have the Hallelujahs.<p>Revelation 19:1, &#8220;And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah.&#8221; This is the conclusion of the Bible, just exactly like that of the Psalms. No more do we have anything about the man being blessed who keeps the law. There is only a great multitude saying, &#8220;Hallelujah; salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great harlot...and again they said, Hallelujah...and the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord our God the Almighty reigneth. Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb (the house and the city). And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God&#8221; (vv. 1-9). Praise the Lord!<p>The Psalms are just the entire Bible in miniature. The whole Bible is for Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. Hallelujah!<p>I am so grateful to the Lord that He has given us such a wonderful time in reading through all these one hundred and fifty Psalms. I do not have adequate utterance. I trust in the Holy Spirit that He will speak something further and deeper than all I have said to you.<p>In 1956, in Taipei, we had a life study on the Psalms. At that time the line was only with Christ and how God has turned the saints from the law to Christ. This time the line is with Christ, the house, the city, and the earth. It is much richer and more wonderful. Hallelujah! In all the history of the church, the Lord has never opened the Psalms as He has today. I am so grateful to the Lord for showing us these things. I have no words to say. I believe that the timing of these messages under the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty is truly wonderful. He has opened the Psalms to us at exactly the right time. Now we only care for Christ; the Lord has turned us from the law to Christ. And Christ has brought us to the house. What can we say but Hallelujah! He is enlarging the house into the city, and from the city He will gain the entire earth. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>A CONCLUDING WORD</h1><p>I believe we have all been deeply impressed with these four words, Christ, house, city, earth. Let us forget about the negative one, the law. We must always remember God&#8217;s Christ, the house of God, the city of God, and the earth. We have seen clearly that the entire book of the Psalms just covers these main points in a wonderful sequence. We have also seen that the picture given us by the book of Psalms is exactly the same as that portrayed by the entire Bible. The whole Bible reveals only Christ, then the church, and then the reigning of Christ over the whole earth with the New Jerusalem as the center.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING CHRIST</h2><p>Let us consider now all the main aspects of Christ in the Psalms:	<ol class="decimal">	<li>His divinity-Psalm 45:6; Heb. 1:8</li>	<li>His incarnation-Psalm 8:4; Heb. 2:6</li>	<li>His humanity-Psalm 8:4; Heb. 2:6</li>	<li>His human living-Psalm 16:1-8</li>	<li>His death-Psalm 22:1-21</li>	<li>His resurrection-Psalms 2:7; 16:10; 22:22; Heb. 2:12; Acts 2:25-32; 13:35-37</li>	<li>His ascension-Psalm 68:18; Eph. 4:8</li>	<li>His exaltation-Psalms 80:17; 110:1</li>	<li>His crowning-Psalm 8:5; Heb. 2:9</li>	<li>His enthronement-Psalm 2:6</li>	<li>His dominion, kingship, and authority-Psalms 2:8; 8:6; 47; 72; 89; 110</li>	<li>His priesthood-Psalm 110:4</li>	<li>His fighting-Psalms 110:5, 6; 45:3-5</li>	<li>His victory-Psalm 110:5, 6</li>	<li>His indwelling-Psalm 22:22</li>	<li>His shepherding-Psalm 23</li>	<li>The stone for the building-Psalm 118:22</li>	<li>His coming-Psalms 72; 96; 110</li>	<li>His reigning-Psalms 93-101</li>	</ol><p>The main Psalms concerning Christ: Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23, 24, 45, 68, 80, 91, 110, 118<p>These are just the main aspects; there are many details which could be filled in. It is clear that through the Psalms we can know Christ much better than through the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING THE HOUSE</h2><p>Now we must go on from Christ to the house. Here we are confronted with a problem. Prior to the last century, before the so-called Brethren in England were raised up, the Old Testament verses concerning the temple and the city were misused in Christianity. The common teaching was that the temple and the city were the church itself. That, of course, was a wrong application. Then the Brethren came forth and received much light upon the Scriptures. They pointed out that to say the temple and the city are the church is wrong The church is the church; the temple of ancient times was the temple, not the church, they asserted. Using the book of Ephesians, they showed that the church was a hidden mystery in the Old Testament. Christians before the last century had gone to one extreme: they said that the temple and city of ancient times were the church. But then the Brethren went to the other extreme, saying that the temple and the city had nothing to do with the church. They did not see so clearly that the temple and the city were both types of the church. Today we have been brought by the Lord to such a point of revelation. We now see that the temple, the house or the city were indeed not the church, but types of the church. Similarly, we do not say that the Passover lamb and the manna were Christ, but that they are types of Christ.<p>How may we prove that the building up of the temple and the city in the Old Testament are types of the building up of the church? It is important that we have a strong basis and proof for this in order to substantiate our position that the building up of the temple and city are types of the building up of God&#8217;s house today. We have such proof in Psalm 68:18, &#8220;Thou hast ascended on high. Thou hast led captive a train of vanquished foes. Thou hast received gifts in man, and even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell with them.&#8221; The key is in the last part of this verse: &#8220;That the Lord God might dwell with them.&#8221; The purpose of Christ&#8217;s ascending on high and receiving gifts was that the dwelling place of God might be built up. Surely, according to Psalm 68:18, this refers to the building up of the temple. We all know this, and we all agree with this. But Paul the apostle quoted this very verse in reference to the church: &#8220;Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto man...and he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ&#8221; (Eph. 4:8, 11-12). When we put these two passages in Psalm 68 and Ephesians 4 together, we have strong proof that the building up of the temple in ancient times was a type of the building up of the church today. This is the ground we have in saying that the temple and the city are types of the church. We do have the basis for saying that all the verses in the Psalms concerning the temple, the house and the city are verses which typify the building up of the church.<p>Now let us see something concerning the aspects of the church as God&#8217;s house in the Psalms. This is a deeper matter. In all the Psalms we have Christ revealed, prophesied, and mentioned in so many aspects; now in all the Psalms we also have the house, that is, the type of one aspect of the church. In many instances the Psalms do not specifically mention the house, but instead they refer to Zion, the holy hill, or the holy mountain. These latter terms refer to the site or the ground upon which the temple was built. When we speak of God&#8217;s house, we must make mention of the house principally as God&#8217;s dwelling and the place of His presence, beauty, glory, and riches. We must also refer to its ground and its foundation. Now let us list these aspects and others as well together with their references. We could add many more aspects than are shown here, but these would be sufficient to indicate that nearly every spiritual blessing is related to the house of God.	<ol class="decimal">	<li>God&#8217;s dwelling-Psalms 68:18; 84:1</li>	<li>The ground, the site-Psalms 24:3; 68:16; 76:2<br>	There was only one site in the entire earth where the house could be built. If it were built in any other place, it would not be God&#8217;s house with the unique unity.	<li>Its foundation is Christ-Psalm 87:1</li>	<li>The place of God&#8217;s presence, which is God&#8217;s glory (Psalm 27:4), God&#8217;s beauty (Psalm 36:7-9), and God&#8217;s riches (Psalms 26:8; 29:9). God&#8217;s presence is His glory, just as the presence of electricity is the glory of electricity. And with the glory is the beauty and the riches.</li>	<li>The place of revelation-Psalm 73:18</li>	<li>The hiding place-Psalm 27:5</li>	<li>The saints&#8217; desire-Psalm 84:2, 10</li>	<li>Its holiness-Psalm 93:5</li>	<li>Its loveliness-Psalm 84:1</li>	<li>Its fatness-Psalm 36:8</li>	<li>Its praise-Psalms 65:1; 84:4</li>	<li>Its salvation-Psalm 53:6</li>	<li>Its victory-Psalms 68:11-12, 21; 76:3</li>	<li>Its two altars-Psalm 84:3</li>	<li>The birthplace-Psalm 87:5</li>	<li>The place where we may be planted-Psalm 92:13</li>	<li>The place where we may flourish-Psalm 92:13</li>	<li>The place where we may bear fruit-Psalm 92:14</li>	<li>The place of springs-Psalm 87:7</li>	<li>The place where we are strengthened-Psalms 68:35; 96:6</li>	<li>The place of the way of God-Psalm 77:13</li>	<li>The place of the goings of God-Psalm 68:20</li>	<li>The place of worship-Psalm 99:9</li>	<li>The place of God&#8217;s answer-Psalms 3:4; 18:6</li>	<li>The place where we are mingled with God-Psalm 92:10</li>	<li>The place where God is our portion-Psalm 73:26</li>	</ol><p>The main Psalms concerning the house: Psalms 27, 36, 68, 84, 92, 122, 132, 150<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING THE CITY</h2><p>We have seen the aspects of Christ and the church as the house in the Psalms; now let us consider the aspects of the church as the city. These are even more wonderful.	<ol class="decimal">	<li>It is a strong city-Psalm 31:21</li>	<li>There is a river with streams within it-Psalm 46:4</li>	<li>God is in the midst of her-Psalm 46:5</li>	<li>She shall not be moved-Psalm 46:5</li>	<li>God shall help her-Psalm 46:5</li>	<li>The Lord is great in her-Psalm 48:1</li>	<li>The Lord is greatly praised in her-Psalm 48:1</li>	<li>It is the mountain of His holiness-Psalm 48:1</li>	<li>It is beautiful in elevation-Psalm 48:2</li>	<li>It is the joy of the whole earth-Psalm 48:2</li>	<li>It is the city of the great King-Psalm 48:2</li>	<li>God is known in her-Psalm 48:3</li>	<li>God is a high fortress in her-Psalm 48:3</li>	<li>She is a terror to the enemy-Psalm 48:4-6</li>	<li>God will establish her forever-Psalm 48:8</li>	<li>It is a city of towers-Psalm 48:12</li>	<li>It is a city of bulwarks-Psalm 48:13</li>	<li>It is a city of palaces-Psalm 48:3, 13</li>	<li>She is the perfection of beauty-Psalm 50:2</li>	<li>She is the goal of God&#8217;s good pleasure-Psalm 51:18</li>	<li>She is the salvation of God&#8217;s people-Psalm 53:6</li>	<li>Kings shall bring presents unto her-Psalm 68:29</li>	<li>God will save her-Psalm 69:35</li>	<li>Those within her shall flourish-Psalm 72:16</li>	<li>There God conquers the enemy-Psalm 76:2-3</li>	<li>God has chosen her and loves her-Psalm 78:68</li>	<li>God&#8217;s foundation is there-Psalm 87:1</li>	<li>Glorious things are spoken of her-Psalm 87:3</li>	<li>She is the birthplace of the saints-Psalm 87:5</li>	<li>She is the birthplace of Christ-Psalm 87:6</li>	<li>The singers and players are there-Psalm 87:7</li>	<li>All our springs are there-Psalm 87:7</li>	<li>All the wicked will be cut off from her-Psalm 101:8</li>	<li>She is built as a compact city-Psalm 122:3</li>	<li>The thrones of judgment are set there-Psalm 122:5</li>	<li>They shall prosper that love her-Psalm 122:6</li>	<li>Peace is within her walls-Psalm 122:7</li>	<li>Prosperity is within her palaces-Psalm 122:7</li>	<li>All shall be put to shame and turned backward that hate her-Psalm 129:5</li>	<li>It is God&#8217;s rest forever-Psalm 132:14</li>	<li>God will abundantly bless her provision-Psalm 132:15</li>	<li>Her saints shall shout aloud for joy-Psalm 132:16</li>	<li>The horn of David will bud there-Psalm 132:17</li>	<li>The Lord blesses others out of her-Psalm 134:3</li>	<li>The Lord is blessed out of her-Psalm 135:21</li>	<li>She is preferred above our chief joy-Psalm 137:6</li>	<li>She is built up by the Lord-Psalm 137:2</li>	<li>The Lord strengthens the bars of her gates-Psalm 147:13</li>	<li>The Lord fills her with the finest of the wheat-Psalm 147:14</li>	<li>Her children are joyful in their King-Psalm 149:2</li>	</ol><p>The main Psalms concerning the city: Psalms 46, 48, 68, 87, 122, 126, 132, 133, 134, 137, 146, 147, 149<p>When we put all these verses together, we see how wonderful this city is. Comparing the aspects of the city with the aspects of the house, we see the difference. The main aspects of the house speak of God&#8217;s presence, whereas the principal aspects of the city bespeak God&#8217;s authority, God&#8217;s ruling power, God&#8217;s reigning. Hence, the house is for the expression of God, and the city is for the dominion of God. The house and the city of God fulfill the purpose of God in the creation of man as expressed in Genesis 1:26, &#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion...&#8221; The image is for the expression, and the dominion is for the authority. Eventually, through Christ and with Christ we have the house for God&#8217;s presence, as God&#8217;s expression, and we have the city for God&#8217;s authority, as God&#8217;s dominion. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is fulfilled by the house and the city. In the house God is a Father, and in the city God is a King. Both the house and the city are the church, or we may say, the local churches. A local church, in one sense, must be the house of God, and in another sense it must also be the city of God.<p>A city evidently is much stronger and larger than a house. Therefore we say that when the house is enlarged it becomes the city, just as the New Jerusalem. We are told that in the New Jerusalem there will be no temple (Rev. 21:22), no house, but just the city. It is because the entire city of the New Jerusalem is the enlargement of the temple. The temple enlarged becomes the city. It is larger, stronger, and safer than the house.<p>We can apply the principle of the house and the city to the local churches in this way: If the presence of God is among us, if when people come to our meeting they worship and say, &#8220;God indeed is among you,&#8221; this is the house. If, on the other hand, when people come among us and realize that there is not only the presence of God, but some kind of divine rule and authority, this is not only the house, but the house with the city.<p>Sometimes in a local church we sense the presence of God, but not much of God&#8217;s authority. We sense that God is among them, but that on the other hand there is a shortage of divine order. That means that in that local church there is the reality of the house, but not much of the city. In other churches we sense not only the presence of God, but also something of divine government and heavenly authority. That is the city. If a local church is in this kind of situation, that church is considerably stronger and safer. It is more elevated, more established, and more enlarged. It is not only the house, but the house with the city.<p>By looking into all these aspects of Christ, the house, and the city as presented in the Psalms, we see how wonderful Christ is, how marvelous the house is, and how glorious and terrifying the city is!<p>Either for Christ to gain the earth, or for the earth to turn and worship Christ, both are through the city. Christ gains the earth and rules over the earth through the city, because He will be in the city. Then the earth will turn to Christ, remember Christ, worship Christ, and praise Christ-all through the city. The city is for the earth.<h2 class=head1>CONCERNING THE EARTH</h2><p>Now let us consider briefly the aspects of the earth as seen in the Psalms. The word earth appears about 190 times altogether in the Psalms.	<ol class="decimal">	<li>The earth has been given to Christ as an inheritance-Psalm 2:8</li>	<li>His name will be excellent in all the earth-Psalm 8:1</li>	<li>The earth is the Lord&#8217;s and the fulness thereof-Psalm 24:1</li>	<li>The earth was created by the Lord-Psalm 24:2</li>	<li>Christ will come back to take the earth-Psalm 96:13</li>	<li>Christ will reign over the earth-Psalm 72:8</li>	<li>Christ will make His saints princes in all the earth-Psalm 45:16</li>	<li>The earth will turn to Christ-Psalm 22:27</li>	<li>The earth will remember Christ-Psalm 22:27</li>	<li>The earth will worship Christ-Psalm 22:27, 29</li>	<li>The earth will praise Christ-Psalm 98:4</li>	<li>The whole earth will be filled with His glory-Psalm 72:19</li>	</ol><p>The main Psalms concerning the earth: Psalms 47, 68, 72, 89, 145, 146, 148, 149<h2 class=head1>THE PURPOSE OF GOD</h2><p>God&#8217;s purpose in the entire universe is to express Himself in a corporate way, not just to express Himself through you or me or some other individual. This is what the enemy opposes and seeks to frustrate more than anything else. The problem on the earth today is headed up in the enemy&#8217;s frustration to God&#8217;s fulfillment of His purpose. The earth became and still is a real frustration to God. With God&#8217;s will there is no problem in heaven, but there is a real problem on this earth (Matt. 6:10). With many Christians there is a religious concept concerning heaven, which causes them to continually consider heaven and their going to that place. But God&#8217;s concern is for the earth; the earth is His desire. We would like to go to heaven, but He would like to come to earth. Eventually, the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven (Rev. 21:2). God&#8217;s problem is now on this earth, which is under Satan&#8217;s usurping hand. God&#8217;s enemy is still usurping the earth to frustrate God&#8217;s purpose; hence, the struggle between God and Satan is over this earth. The key to this struggle is humanity. If God could gain humanity, He would win. If Satan could keep humanity in his hand, he would win. Humanity today is also a problem to God; so out of humanity God is building up a church. The church, a building of Christ in humanity, is the key for God to win the victory. If God today could obtain a church, it is certain that He would have the victory. The Lord has ascended, two thousand years have passed, and still He has not come back. The reason He has not returned is that the church is not ready. Today God has not yet obtained the key, the church that is built up with Christ in humanity.<p>The Psalms show us that God&#8217;s intention is to recover His title, His legal rights, over the whole earth through Christ in the church, through Christ in the house, through Christ in the city. Hence, there is the need of the holy hill of Zion. We not only need Christ, but Christ in Zion, Christ in the holy hill. Thus, we have seen that the beachhead, the steppingstone, for God to take over the earth is the church. The building up of the church is not a small matter; it is the key to God&#8217;s purpose. This is His work; it is not ours, and we have no ambition in this affair. But we are burdened today that God must have His key. Without the house, without the city, there is no beachhead for God to launch back and recover the earth.<p>In past years and even at the present time we have seen that wherever and whenever there is a real expression of God, there we find God&#8217;s presence, and there we sense God&#8217;s anointing. God honors such an expression so greatly because it is the key for the fulfillment of His purpose on earth. He needs a church, a proper church. He needs a house and even a city that He may consider as a stepping-stone for Him to return. His full and longing desire is to step into the earth, but there is as yet no stepping-stone; there is no place where He may put His feet. He yearns to recover the entire earth from the usurping hand of the serpent, but without a beachhead established here it is difficult for Him to accomplish it. He is waiting for a built up church here and there in so many cities on this earth.<p>All five books of the Psalms show us that the earth is the ultimate intention of God&#8217;s desire. He must conquer the earth, recover the earth, and bring it back under His rightful rule. That is why the Lord taught us to pray in Matthew 6:9-10, &#8220;Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.&#8221; But His will is not yet done on the earth. That is why He taught us to pray, &#8220;Thy name be hallowed.&#8221; But His name is not yet hallowed on earth. That is why He taught us to pray, &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; But His kingdom has not yet come. Psalm 8 tells us, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.&#8221; But His name is still not excellent in all the earth. God is waiting for the building up of the local churches. When He has this, His name will be hallowed, His Kingdom will come, His will be done on earth as in heaven, and His name will be excellent in all the earth. The building up of the local churches is a tremendous matter.<p>In the four or five centuries since the reformation the Lord has recovered many things. He has fully recovered the preaching of the Gospel. From the beginning of the last century to about 1930 the Gospel was brought to nearly every corner of the earth. Wherever you go today, in any leading city, there the Gospel is preached, and there are a number of believers. The Lord has spent much time to spread His Gospel throughout the earth and to raise up so many believers. Now, in such a situation, what more must the Lord recover? Undoubtedly, He must recover the practical building up of His local churches in many places with so many believers as the materials. It is entirely reasonable to arrive at such a conclusion. In this day, before His soon coming, He must have such a building on this earth, at least in all the leading cities. But where is the building? Is it in so many small free groups, denominations, and organizations? Certainly not. It is in the local churches that He is recovering the practical building for His coming back.<p>We are living today in a very crucial time. We are standing at an extremely strategic point in history. The issue of God&#8217;s work in the earth today is tremendous. May the Lord be merciful to us and grant us His grace that we may go on with Him. May He open our eyes to see and appreciate His recovery. We appreciate other works which are being done for the Lord, but the unique, strategic work of the Lord today is the practical building up of the local churches in the leading cities of this earth. After a few years you will see what will come forth all over this earth. The Lord will honor this move. He must have the building up of the house and the city that He may recover the entire earth. This is our burden. For this reason we have spent so much time studying the Psalms. There is not one book, even in the New Testament, which reveals these things so clearly as the Psalms. The local churches are the stepping-stone, the beachhead, for Him to take the earth and fulfill His purpose. He will certainly do it. How glorious this will be. What a wonderful experience we will have at that time!<p>The more we pray-read the Psalms, the more we see how good it is that God has turned us from the law to Christ, that He has brought us from Christ to the house, that we may be enlarged from the house to the city, and that from the city He is recovering the whole earth. Then God&#8217;s purpose will be fulfilled. Then we will all say, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
