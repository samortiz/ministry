   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not to Contact Those Who Do Not Abide in the Teaching of Christ the Teaching concerning Christ's Deity and Incarnation by Divine Conception</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works" 2 John 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses reveal that we should not contact those who do not abide in the teaching of Christ the teaching concerning Christ's deity and incarnation by divine conception.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Literally, the Greek word translated "goes beyond" in verse 9 means to lead forward in a negative sense , that is, to go further than what is right, to advance beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who go beyond in this way go beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ and thus deny the deity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consequently they do not have God in salvation and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 9 John speaks of not abiding in the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not the teaching by Christ but the teaching concerning Christ, that is, the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today's modernists go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They also claim to be advanced in their thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to them, it is out-of-date to say that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin through divine conception, that He died on the cross for our sins, and that He was resurrected both physically and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Denying this truth concerning Christ, the modernists claim to be advanced in their philosophical thought.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to verse 9, the one who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But he who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To "have God" is to have both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to verse 10, we should not receive the one who does not bring the teaching concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The pronoun "him" in this verse refers to a heretic, an antichrist, a false prophet, who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we should not tell such a one to rejoice, to be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not have any contact with those who do not abide in the teaching of Christ; that is, we should have a severe and clear separation from those who do not have the teaching concerning Christ's deity and incarnation by divine conception.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this point I would like to say a word concerning the conception and birth of the Lord Jesus, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 1:20 says, "While he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse the King James Version uses "conceived" instead of "begotten."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "conceived" is a proper, normal, ordinary description of conception within a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "begotten" is a particular expression used to describe the conception that had taken place in Mary's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within Mary something was not merely conceived but was begotten.</S>
