   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYING AT EVERY TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians, a book on Christ, the Head, and Ephesians, a book on the Body, both end with the same charge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 6:18 says, By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Praying at every time means not only on every hour or every half hour, but all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All prayer means all kinds of prayers short prayers, long prayers, loud prayers, silent prayers, public prayers, private prayers, prayer by yourself, prayer by a number of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It doesn t mean whenever you pray you need to do these things; it means that at every time you need to pray; even every minute you have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Pray at all times, pray at every time, in spirit watching unto this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Watching unto this refers back to the prayer at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means you should be wakeful to such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You shouldn t be sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It even says watching unto this in all perseverance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means not only one kind of perseverance, but all kinds of perseverance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to persist; you have to insist to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that there may be something holding you down, holding you back, suppressing, oppressing, depressing, hindering you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So you have to persevere; you have to be persistent; you have to insist; you would not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus Paul also picked up the thought to combine pray and watch.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seed of praying and watching was sown in Matthew and the development is here in Paul s Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of us know that Ephesians is a book on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But how can you have the Body life?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not just to understand it, although we surely need to understand because we are complicated people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The enjoyment of food comes from the taste of the food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you don t have any knowledge of the taste of a certain food you could never love that food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once you have some knowledge concerning a certain food you will have an emotional aspiration for that food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then you need a strong will to get the food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then you will eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, to have the church life we need Ephesians to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after being taught shall we simply keep the knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After being taught with the knowledge concerning the Body of Christ, you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And you need to pray at every time, not only in the morning or at noontime or in the afternoon or before bedtime.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to pray at every time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the revelation of Ephesians we have to pray in order to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although you may have the knowledge concerning the church, without praying unceasingly you cannot have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church life does not remain with your knowledge; it remains with your praying, even with your continual and persistent prayer all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of Ephesians such a charge is given, indicating that the church depends upon our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we don t have a prayer life, we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may have a lot of knowledge, a lot of revelation concerning the Body, but this does not mean we can have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have the church life depends upon our continual prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 6:18, like other verses in these four books, uses many modifiers: By means...of all prayer...praying at every time in spirit...in...petition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to pray and watch unto prayer in petition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way to watch unto prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means you have to pray every minute and then you have to be awake, not sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to be awake to this kind of continual prayer, and this watching is in all petition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that while you are praying, you are watchful; while you are praying, you are awake.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Lord s word in Matthew 26, we are all sleepy persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you don t sleep physically, you sleep spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And many times you sleep psychologically.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While I am speaking some may be sleeping physically while others are sleeping psychologically.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means their mind and their attention and their hearing and their realization are absent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes you are sleeping spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means your perception is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be a person who prays unceasingly you must be a watchful person, a person fully awakened, fighting against your sleeping nature and your sleeping being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How do you fight?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By petitioning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Prayer is a general thing; petition is a special, particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have to watch unto the general prayer by special petition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Matthew the Lord Jesus only said watch and pray, but Paul developed it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul s speaking corresponds with the Lord s. The Lord said, The spirit indeed is ready, and Paul said, Praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul s word indicates we should forget about our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You shouldn t let your body sleep so much, but let your spirit pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But nearly all the day long we have been subdued and controlled either by our body or by our psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So we have to let our spirit rise up over our body and over our psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we can pray, and we can watch unto prayer in the way of all petition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Of course, this will tire you out, but you need to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you re going to get strength, you have to spend strength.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If your automobile doesn t run for a certain period of time, the battery will be run down.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While the car is running it exhausts the battery, but it also charges the battery.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How do you get more strength?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Exercise!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you don t pray today you cannot pray tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you don t pray in the morning you cannot pray at noontime or in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One time of prayer strengthens you to pray two more times.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Two times of prayer strengthens you to pray four times.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more you pray the more you will have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more you pray the more you will like to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>And the more you pray the more you will be able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am in good physical condition because I get a lot of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If I miss two or three days of walking I feel awkward when I begin to exercise again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I may start out walking only sixty minutes a day, but every day I add a minute, and soon I can walk one and one-half hours.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When I exercise every day my walking is so refreshing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It doesn t give me an awkward feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Exercise increases your strength.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you don t pray, you just don t like to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you pray, your appetite for prayer will be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>So you have to pray and watch unto prayer in all petition.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This means don t cease in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Don t stop your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Pray all the time and keep yourself all the time wakeful.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You have to fight against the threefold sleep: physical, psychological, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This word concerning prayer is the concluding charge in the book of Ephesians, a book which reveals the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Isn t this meaningful?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you don t have such a kind of watchful prayer, it would be difficult to have the church life.</S>
