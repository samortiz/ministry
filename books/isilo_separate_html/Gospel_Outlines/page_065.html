<h1 class="title">WHO IS JESUS?</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Matt. 16:13-17<br />
The Lord Jesus and His disciples discussed one subject in these verses: &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of man is?...Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; This was mentioned in Subject 61, but was not a complete message. Now, we make it a full subject. This subject is more difficult to preach.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Who did the Jews say that Jesus was?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Those who opposed Him said that Jesus was a carpenter from Nazareth, the son of Joseph; they said that He was only a man.</li>
	<li>Those who favored Him said that He was one of the prophets, like Elijah, Jeremiah, or John the Baptist.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Who did the Gentiles say that He was?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Gentiles of the past generations said that He was a religious revolutionary or a noble philosopher.</li>
	<li>Others said that He was a servant who sacrificed Himself. To summarize, men have said that Jesus was one of four things: (1) a religious revolutionist, (2) a noble philosopher, (3) a noble moralist, or (4) a sacrificial servant.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Who does He Himself say that He is?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He said that He is the Son of God.</li>
	<li>He accepts man&rsquo;s worship as God. He told people that He was the Son of God. The Son of God is God. Therefore, He accepts man&rsquo;s worship to Him as God.</li>
	<li>His doings substantiated His words. His word says that He is the Son of God. He called not being as being; He commanded the storm and the waves, and they were calm. He healed the sick, He cast out demons, and He gave life to the dead. All these proved His words.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Who does the Bible say that He is?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Old Testament says that He is God. In Isaiah 7:14 He is called Immanuel. Isaiah 9:6 says that a child is born, and His name shall be called the Mighty God. Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;Out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The New Testament tells us more clearly that He is God, the Son of God (John 10:30; 3:16).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Who does history say that He is?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The two thousand year history of the Christian faith proves that He is an extraordinary One. History reveals to us that no matter how people on this earth have opposed Him, He has always been victorious.</li>
	<li>The fact of today&rsquo;s continued evangelism proves that He is God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fruits of the gospel prove that He is God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man receives inner peace whenever he accepts Jesus. Because He is God, He can forgive man&rsquo;s sins and give peace to man&rsquo;s conscience.</li>
	<li>When man accepts Jesus as Savior, his life is changed. From deep within to his outward living, there is a great change. This wonderful change proves that Jesus is God.</li>
	<li>Many believers had sicknesses which were healed when they called upon the name of the Lord. This also proves that He is God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What shall we do with Him?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Turn to Him and repent.</li>
	<li>Accept Him; believe in Him.</li>
	<li>Follow Him, that is, serve Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
