   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S EXPRESSION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament began not with nine great men but with one unique man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This man is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is God in the heavens becoming a man on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So this man joined the heavens to the earth and brought the earth up to join the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was surely the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream Gen 28:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This ladder is the very gate of heaven and also the house of God, Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While He was on this earth He was tabernacling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The tabernacle, the first stage of God's dwelling place in Exodus, was not grounded, but was traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth He also was traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He traveled from Galilee to Judea, from Nazareth to Bethlehem, from Jerusalem to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was really a traveling tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But He was God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As God's temple He was destroyed, and He raised Himself up in the way of enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His resurrection He raised us up with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Don't think that you were saved in the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You were resurrected in the first century when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of us were resurrected with Him and became the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The temple was on a bigger scale than the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus was the tabernacle traveling on the earth, He only traveled in a small country, the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was the infinite God in eternity, yet He became a finite man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after He raised Himself up in an enlarged way, that tabernacle became a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This temple today is all over the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the four Gospels, God was manifested in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But from Acts to Revelation God is expressed in a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So the New Testament is also easy to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It contains a unique man who was God's tabernacle and the church which is the enlargement of this unique man as God's dwelling place on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION IN ITS MODEL</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The nine great men in the Old Testament issued in God's dwelling place for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But that was still not the real thing; that was just a model.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the last chapter we pointed out that the Old Testament and the New Testament reveal the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Old Testament reveals the model, while the New Testament reveals the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Exodus 40:17-33 there is a depiction of all the details of this model.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In these seventeen verses one clause has been repeated seven times: "As the Lord commanded Moses."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that the model is of seven sections.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever one section is completed in its rearing up, that section ends with this word, "As the Lord commanded Moses."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first section is that of rearing up or erecting the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First the foundation was laid, not with cement blocks, but with one hundred silver sockets, each of which was made of one talent of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A talent weighs over one hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It may be that at least four persons were needed to carry the sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means four hundred young men were needed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They must be matured, otherwise how could they carry the silver sockets as the foundation?</S>
