   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today there are not many who know the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, there are a few who recognize the indications of the Lord's deeds and realize that what happened to them was of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our knowing of the Lord, most of us are exactly like Joseph's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not consider Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we consider our money, our possessions, and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Joseph's brothers did not search for the reason that a high ruler would do such things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were fully occupied with their own interests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They had no thought that the man who was dealing with them might be Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter how many good things the Lord has done for us, we still do not understand what the Lord is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord does everything with a good intention, but we regard it as a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if we knew it was a blessing, we still would not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Joseph's brothers had no discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even after he had seated them according to the sequence of their birth, they still did not realize who he was.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They had become preoccupied even before they had left home to travel to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Joseph's heart was good, but their thought concerning him was evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were totally preoccupied by their evil thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would do the same thing if we had evil thoughts towards someone who, with a good intention, invited us to his home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to our evil thoughts, we might fear that poison had been injected into the food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we might not be able to refuse the invitation, we would be afraid to eat the food set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our host's intention is love, but our thought is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph's brothers were filled with such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These thoughts were the colored glasses that kept them from seeing who Joseph was.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to all these indications of Joseph's identity, there are two further indications.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 32 says, "And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Three tables were prepared, one for Joseph, one for the Egyptians, and one for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the Egyptians did not eat according to the Hebrew way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In what way do you suppose Joseph ate, in the Egyptian way or the Hebrew way?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Certainly he must have eaten in the Hebrew way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Joseph's brothers should have recognized that here was an Egyptian eating in the Hebrew way, a way that was abominable to the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph ordered the tables to be set up this way in order to indicate to his brothers that he was a Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The brothers should have considered that this ruler was a Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How stupid Joseph's brothers were!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I had been there, I would have said, "Levi, this man is a Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, he is younger than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Look at his face.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isn't he Joseph?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although Joseph spoke the Egyptian language, they should have recognized his voice and his intonation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, they still failed to recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Still another indication is found in verse 26: "And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Joseph's brothers were bowing down to him, they should have remembered his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Twenty-two years before Joseph had had a dream, and now it was being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you had been one of Joseph's brothers bowing down to him, you might have said, "This might be Joseph, the master of dreams."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Joseph's brothers had heard about the dream and were in the fulfillment of the dream, they did not recognize Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps you are wondering why Joseph did not simply reveal himself to his brothers at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If Joseph had done this, he would have been very childish.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He preferred to give them some indications to help them to recognize who he was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How sweet it would have been if they had recognized him!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, due to their preoccupations and stupidity, it did not happen this way.</S>
