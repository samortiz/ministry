   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mephibosheth's heart was a widow's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the king was not there, he lost his heart for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A very deep believer once said, "Wherever Jesus is, there is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If Jesus is in hell, then hell is heaven too.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Jesus is not in heaven, then it is not heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time I thought that there could not be such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But today I want to say that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the beginning all we thought about was the problem of sins, but now all we think about is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Formerly our thoughts were on being delivered from the punishment of hell, but now we think about the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, if the Lord is in heaven, heaven is lovely, but if the Lord is in hell, even hell will be lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This world is nothing but a wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is a wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that the beauty, art, and natural scenery of the world are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But all these mean nothing to us anymore because He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can we love the world when it looks down on the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have said before that wherever our lover is, there is the land of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The house, clothes, food, and drink may be the same, but if our beloved is not there, all of these things will seem different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My hometown is Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have often thought about going back to it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it is not Foochow that I miss, but the brothers and sisters who are of the same mind there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They suffered difficulties and poverty together with me, and they also were opposed by other people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I could forget Foochow easily if they were not there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same is true with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot find rest and happiness in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only attitude we should have toward the world is that of a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Mephibosheth came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>25-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see that he did not mention anything about the bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He only mentioned that he was deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His heart felt that it was sufficient that the king had returned peacefully; it really did not matter that much about being slandered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a person wants to express his heart, he does not necessarily have to use words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If someone has become a slave of the Lord's love, he will not be able to express his heart with words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The deeper the love, the more secretive it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you really love the Lord, you will still keep yourself pure when others are opposing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the day we meet the Lord, we will not tell Him, "Lord, such have I given up for You on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On that day you will not say anything about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You will say, "I regret that while living on earth, I did not love You more deeply and did not serve You more faithfully."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time you will feel that even if you have a million words to offer to the Lord, it would still not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mephibosheth did not say anything else, other than of his being deceived by his servant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was only one thing in his heart: it is good enough that David my king has returned; being slandered does not mean that much.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as I can sit at David's table, that is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do not need to say anything more about being slandered, nor do I need to vindicate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as the king has returned, that is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every time when I read this word of Mephibosheth, I say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the King can come back in peace, what does it matter if I gain or lose?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If my Lord has gained something, even if I lose something, what does it matter?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All that matters is whether He is safe or not; it does not matter if the things He gives still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" Job 13:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One martyred saint said on the night before he was going to be executed, "God, if You do not come in and interfere, tomorrow I will go blindly just as I am, come heaven or hell."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was a hero of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord will not wrong us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But even if He ill-treats us, we should delight in His ill-treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as He is pleased, and as long as it is according to His heart's desire, we will feel sweet even when we are ill-treated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Of course, the way David handled Mephibosheth was wrong, but our Lord will not do so to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By being wronged, Mephibosheth's heart was clearly revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord wants to save us to the extent that we care only for the Lord's gain or loss and not for our gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's gain or loss is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our own gain or loss matters nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once I needed to obey the Lord, yet I could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Finally, I had to tell the Lord, "Do not give in, please allow me to give in."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We ought to give in, not God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The One who once captured my heart has captured it forever.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since my heart had been captured by Him, all that I have is His.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, what is our hope and expectation before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Are we still making plans for ourselves, or are we for Him?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From now on may we regard all that we have as His and only care about His gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As long as He gains something, that is good enough.</S>
