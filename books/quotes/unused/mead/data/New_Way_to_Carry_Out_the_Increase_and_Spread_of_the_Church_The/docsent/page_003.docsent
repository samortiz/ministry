   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BRINGING A MEETING TO THEM IN THEIR HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, when we are going to knock on people s doors we must learn one thing we are not going out to invite people to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are going out to send a meeting to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we go to them, we bring the meeting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some dear saints have been absent from the church meetings for years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we asked them to come back to the meetings, it would be hard for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Out of one hundred, maybe three or five would come back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the new way we have found out is so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you go to visit some saints who have been absent from the meeting for five years, you can go to them and have a meeting in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then they would ask you to come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Right away in a backslider s home, a meeting is set up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are happy to have home meetings in their homes by your going there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past we had big gospel meetings with gospel campaigns and conferences, but very few were really caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we found out that it is so easy to knock on the doors and establish a home meeting in another person s home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To knock on people s doors and invite them to our meeting is to practice the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you open up your mouth in this way, you will lose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You will receive no for an answer most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our intention is not to bring people into the church life in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Taipei we scheduled that from 1985, within five years five hundred new full-timers would be produced every year.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Right away the Lord did something in Taipei since these full-timers took the new way to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The news came back that hundreds were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At first all the elders were happy, but after two or three months they became disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They said, Where are the baptized ones?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We supplied all the full-timers to go out to baptize people, but thus far we have not seen one coming to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, the more full-timers we supply, the more of them we lose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the church meeting time they do not come to the meeting but go out to baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, our number is reduced in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I told the brothers not to be in so much of a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you sow you apparently lose something, but your labor needs a period of time for the fruit of it to be seen Psa 126:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you have a harvest you will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all would like to have a quick harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Tonight I sow and tomorrow I reap.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then everyone is happy immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we must realize that a quick harvest only yields artificial things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It takes time for real flowers to grow into many blossoms, but factories can produce artificial flowers overnight by the thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Constantine the Great did something like this when he accepted Christianity and made it a state religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Millions of unbelievers became Christians by Constantine s edict, without having to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The millions that became Christians were artificial believers, not genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to exercise patience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not expect to reap quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to go out to sow like the Lord Jesus did.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to read the four Gospels again to see how much the Lord sowed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At one time He fed five thousand Matt 14:14-21 , and at another time He fed four thousand 15:32-39 , not including the women and children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord sowed Himself into thousands of people, but eventually in Acts there were only one hundred and twenty in the upper room 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those one hundred and twenty were the cream of the result of the Lord s work after three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His resurrection He showed Himself to over five hundred disciples 1 Cor 15:6 , but not all five hundred were there in Jerusalem only one hundred and twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to follow the Lord to sow, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do the best to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sooner or later whatever you sow will become your reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you go, you must first get yourself prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The best way to get yourself prepared is to pray to contact the Lord, not to pray for your going out, not to pray for the gospel work, but to pray to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let Him enlighten you so your entire being will be brought fully into light; let Him shine in you, upon you, over you, and through you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the light you will see all your shortcomings, all your weak points, all kinds of sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Spontaneously you will make a thorough confession.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more you confess, the more you will be filled by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To prepare yourself for going out to visit people by knocking on doors, you should be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Acts 4:31 says that after praying the believers were all filled with the Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For the brothers and sisters to go out to knock on others doors may be quite threatening, but if we get ourselves prepared by being filled with the Spirit, we will have the boldness.</S>
