   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REJECTING DEPUTY AUTHORITY BEING TO REJECT GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The whole parable in Luke 20:9-16 is on deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God leased the vineyard to the vinedresser, but He did not come to personally collect the rent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first, second, and third time He sent His servants; the fourth time He sent His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of these were His representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God could have come Himself, but instead He sent His representative.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's eyes all those who rejected His servants rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot hearken to God's word, yet refuse the word of His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to submit to God's authority as well as to His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other than in Acts 9:4-15, which speaks of the Lord's direct authority, the Lord entrusts His authority to deputy authorities in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One may say that almost all authorities are entrusted to man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many think that this means submitting to man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you have met authority, you will know that this is God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need for humility for one to submit to God's direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But there must be humility and brokenness for one to submit to the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only by laying the flesh completely aside can one accept and obey the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We constantly have to see that God does not come personally to collect His rent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God sends representatives to collect rent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What should we do with God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Should we wait for God to come personally?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He comes personally, it will not be for rent, but for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord showed Paul at one point that for him to withstand the Lord was to kick against the goads Acts 26:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Paul saw the light, he saw authority as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was Paul putting himself directly under the Lord's own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But then the Lord placed Paul under His appointed deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord said, "Rise up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do" 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that time on Paul knew authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did not say, "It is so rare that I meet the Lord Himself; let Him tell me what to do."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time, the Lord placed Paul under a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It did not please the Lord to tell Paul directly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the time we have believed in the Lord until now, how many deputy authorities have we submitted to?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How many times have we submitted to them?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Prior to this, we did not have the light, but today we have to see in a serious way God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have been talking about submission for five or ten years, but how much have we submitted to indirect authorities?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What God looks at is not His own direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He looks at His established, indirect authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who do not submit to God's indirect authorities cannot submit to God's direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the sake of clarity in explanation, we have differentiated between direct authority and indirect authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, in God's eyes it is just one authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot despise authority in the family or in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot despise any deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Paul was blind, it was as if he were waiting for Ananias with open eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he saw Ananias, it was as if he saw the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he listened to Ananias, it was as if he was listening to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The deputy authority involves such serious matters that if you offend him you get into trouble with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is impossible for you to reject light from the deputy authority and hope to receive light from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul did not say, "Since Cornelius asked for Peter, I also can ask God to send Peter or James.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not want this little brother Ananias to be my authority."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is impossible for us to reject the deputy authority and to submit to God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because the rejection of deputy authority is a rejection of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only foolish ones will want the deputy authority to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He who dislikes God's representative dislikes God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man's rebellious nature likes to submit to God's direct authority, but reject God's appointed deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>GOD HONORING HIS DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Numbers 30 speaks of a woman's vow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a woman was young in her father's house, her father had to silently acknowledge the vow before it would become effective.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the father disallowed it, the vow would not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If she was married, then the vow had to be silently acknowledged by the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the husband disallowed it, then the vow was annulled vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the deputy authority consents, the direct authority fulfills it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the deputy authority disallows it, the direct authority disowns it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God is pleased with having deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He also honors the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a woman is under the authority of her husband, God will not uphold her vow as long as the husband disallows it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God only wants her to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if the deputy authority is wrong, God will deal with him; he will have to bear the iniquity of his wife, and the submitting wife is guiltless v. 15 . This chapter tells us that man cannot overstep the deputy authority to submit to the direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since God has handed out His authority, even He Himself will not overstep His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even He Himself is bound by the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God establishes through the establishment of the deputy authority, and He annuls through the annulling of the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God wants to maintain His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, we have only one way with the deputy authority, which is the way of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The whole New Testament upholds deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only in Acts 5:29, when the Sanhedrin persecuted Peter by forbidding him to preach in the Lord's name, did Peter say, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only when the deputy authority obviously defies God's commandment and offends the Lord's person can we refuse the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, this kind of word can only be spoken under such a circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Other than this, we have to submit to the deputy authority in any other circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We cannot be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must not fulfill submission by exercising rebellion.</S>
