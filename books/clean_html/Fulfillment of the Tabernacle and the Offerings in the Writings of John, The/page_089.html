<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 8</h1><p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that today in actuality and practicality for our experience Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the extract of the last Adam, God incarnate. Let us now go on to consider the essence of this divine extract.<h2 class=head1>THE SON OF THE FATHER</h2><p>The greatest argument between the Lord Jesus and the Pharisees in chapter eight of the Gospel of John concerned who the Lord was. The Jews said to Him, “Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Whom are you making yourself?” (v. 53). It was difficult for the Lord Jesus to answer this question, because who He is and what He is, are not simple matters and cannot be expressed in simple terms. According to John 8, the Lord Jesus is the Son of the Father. The first element of the divine extract is the Son of the Father. The One who is the Son of the Father is the Emancipator, the One who sets us free.<p>In this chapter it is revealed very clearly that the wonderful Emancipator is the Son of the Father. The Father is the unique source. He is the source of the divine economy and of all that the Triune God is. The Emancipator, the One who sets us free from the slavery of sin, is the Son of this source. He is the expression, the coming forth, of the Father.<h2 class=head1>THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2><p>In 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, “I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” This indicates that the whole world is in darkness and is filled with darkness. Darkness implies sin and death. What is the darkness that fills the entire world? This darkness is sin, which issues in death. All of human society, the entire human race, is under darkness. Sin is darkness, and sin results in death. Consider the situation in the world today. In every country, including remote backward countries, the people are living in sin. They do not have any light, but instead live in darkness.<p>John chapter eight deals with fornication as the basic sin. In principle, fornication is the base for all sin. The first sin committed by Adam and Eve was, according to its spiritual significance, the sin of fornication. This means they committed fornication in turning to something other than God. Although they were made by God and for God, they left God. They turned their heart and their being to something in place of God. In principle, that was the committing of fornication. Hence, the first sin committed by Adam, according to its spiritual significance, was the sin of fornication. For this reason, we say that fornication is the basic sin, the base for all other sins.<p>In chapter eight John uses a case of fornication as an illustration of what sin is. This case is a sign that, in principle, every sin we commit is a sin of fornication. To commit spiritual fornication is to turn away from God to something apart from Him. Today the entire human race is turning away from God to other things. This means that, no matter what they are doing, in principle they are committing fornication. Whenever we enjoy other things, such as worldly entertainments and amusements, in place of God, in His sight that is fornication. John 8 deals with fornication as the basic sin.<p>We have seen that in this chapter the Lord Jesus declares that He is the light of the world. This light shines in the darkness, repels it, and even swallows it. Only light can swallow darkness. When light comes, darkness vanishes immediately. Only light can repel darkness. There is no way to get rid of darkness unless light comes. Who is the light that repels the darkness of sin and death? This light is Jesus, the Son of God.<p>When we receive the Lord Jesus, He becomes the light of life to us. This means that the light becomes life and brings in life. According to Genesis 1, when there was light, it was possible for living things to come into existence.<p>Light issues in life. As the Son of God, Christ is the light of the world. When we receive the shining of this light, we receive life, for the light, as the light of life, issues in life. This light is different from natural light or electrical light, which are not living. The light we have received from Christ is living. It lives in us, it grows, and it reproduces because it is the light of life.<p>Now we have seen three elements of the divine extract: the Son of the Father, light, and life. Let us now go on to consider the great I Am.
