The reason that they are not merely forgiven is because our sins are also judged before they are forgiven. Our sins are not forgiven without being first judged by God. Brothers and sisters, you can remember many sins of yours, and I can remember many sins of mine. God is not ignorant of our sins and does not gloss over them; He does not skip over the judgment of our sins. He does not do this. We have the Lamb of the Passover. How did God pass over the firstborn among the Israelites? The lamb of the Passover received the judgment. Judgment has also truly passed over us. We have the Lamb of God to take away our sins. If we are clear about this matter, we will be able to peacefully say that we are saved. Many people wonder if they are saved. How do we know that we are saved? Let me say this: God is never careless. He judges sin according to His righteousness. I have said before that grace never reigns directly. It does not reign directly; it always reigns through righteousness. Grace does not come to us directly. Rather, it comes to us through the cross. Apart from the cross and from God's judgment and punishment, there is no grace! We are not forgiven because God has mercy on us when He sees our regret, sorrow, and weeping. God will never respond to this. Weeping, regret, and reform will never win God's forgiveness. We are first judged and then forgiven and saved.</P><P>The title of a gospel tract says Salvation through Faith and Not through Prayer. We are not saved through prayer but by fully trusting in the Lord's death and precious blood which cleanses and redeems us from our sins and from punishment. Therefore, we are saved not directly through grace; we are saved because, after believing, we deserve to be saved. This is righteousness. It would be very painstaking if we had to beg the Lord to save us. We could cry and earnestly beseech, but not know if the Lord had answered us. We would not know that He wanted to sacrifice His life for us and save sinners like us. If He did not answer our prayers, no one could say that He was not righteous or wrong. Thank God that He Himself caused the Lord Jesus to come to the earth, die on the cross, be buried in a tomb, and resurrect and ascend on the third day. Thank God that His Son accomplished redemption. He died because of our sins and was resurrected for our justification. From that day on, God could save sinners. From that day on, everyone who believes in and receives His Son is saved. If He did not save us, He would be unrighteous. This may sound presumptuous, but even if God does not want to save us, there is no way for Him not to save us. He cannot hold back His salvation, because He has accepted the redemption that the Lord has accomplished on the cross. The Lord died and paid all the debts of sins. Therefore, He has to save us.</P><P>I really like the following story. Once two sisters were playing together. Both were very young, and both were saved. The younger one asked the older one, "How were you saved?" The older one said, "By God's grace." The younger one then said, "But I am saved by God's righteousness." She was right. God has accepted the Lord's death and resurrection. The punishment and judgment that we deserve have all been executed on the cross of the Lord. Now we can be saved through God's righteousness.</P><P>Concerning the matter of forgiveness, many people have lost sight of the fact that we are dealing with God within the confines of the covenant. Is it by grace that we are now saved and freed? No, it is by righteousness. Suppose a rich man has written a ten thousand dollar check to a poor man. Whenever the poor man lacks something, he can go to the bank and cash it. This is clearly tremendous grace. But if, when the poor man takes the check to the bank, the bank refuses to cash it for him, this would be unrighteousness. The rich man does not have to give the poor man the ten thousand dollar check. But if he has given it to the poor man, and the bank does not cash it, then this constitutes unrighteousness and is no longer just a lack of grace. The denial is a matter of unrighteousness and unfaithfulness. The Lord has been crucified. If God did not forgive us, He would be unrighteous, and I say this most reverently. If God had not given us His Son, we could only say that He does not love us or is not gracious to us. But He has given us His Son, who died for us. He was crucified, and His blood was shed. He has passed through God's judgment and punishment. If God did not save us, would this not be unrighteousness? God saves us according to righteousness. However, today we are not lifting up God's righteousness; we are lifting up His grace and the cross. Only the greatest grace can accomplish this.</P><P>Some people have asked how they can know that they are saved. They did not have the peace and joy of salvation that others had after they prayed. They did not dare say that they were saved. I asked them, "Have you received the Lord Jesus? If you have, you are saved." God cannot sin (which I say most reverently); in the same way, He cannot be unrighteous. Being unrighteous is to sin. Since God cannot sin, He cannot be unrighteous either; He has to save us. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, shed His blood, and was judged and punished, we were also judged and punished. God can no longer punish us or send us to the lake of fire. He has to save us. If we have believed in Jesus and accepted Him as the redeeming Savior, God can say nothing more to us. Brothers and sisters, this is all I can say. Today God has confined Himself to His covenant; He is no longer free. Everyone who has believed in His Son is saved. Do you still doubt His ability to save you?</P><P>Today I will ask one question. Please answer and pardon me for asking in this way. Do you know for sure that your sins are forgiven? Will you still perish? You have accepted the Lord Jesus and believed in Him, but do you know that you are saved? Will you still perish? Truly I tell you, even if heaven and earth passed away, you and I would never perish. The devil has no way to make you perish; the angels have no way to stop you from being saved; even God Himself has no power to make you perish (I say this most reverently); even if you wanted to perish and no longer be saved, you could not do so anymore.</P><P>What does Hebrews 8:12 say? "For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore." This refers to God's forgiveness of us in Christ Jesus. Since Christ has died for us, God can be propitious to our unrighteousnesses. The next clause says, "And their sins I shall by no means remember anymore." What does this mean? Why will God not remember our sins? Does this mean that He has forgotten our sins? Precisely! Many times, the things that God remembers, we forget, and the things that God forgets, we remember. What has God forgotten? Has He not fully forgotten our sins to the extent that they have disappeared as clouds and smoke? God said that He has erased our sins and that there is nothing more to them. Unfortunately, many people still remember their sins. They think that they have committed many gross sins and wonder if God will ever forgive and forget these sins. They think that it is unlikely that God will ever forgive or forget these sins. Many people have a memory that is too good. Their memory is better than God's. Many people think that God has merely rubbed away our sins and that when He sees the rubbed-away marks, He will be reminded of our sins. I can tell you that God has forgotten all your sins. Through the blood of the Lord Jesus, God has forgotten all of our sins, both big sins and small sins, both this sin and that sin, both the sins we remember and the sins we have forgotten, both intentional sins and unintentional sins-every sin-so that it is as if we have never sinned. Everyone who has heard this gospel will say, "Hallelujah!" There is no gospel better than this gospel. Through the Lord Jesus, God has forgotten the sins of everyone who has believed. All our sins have been washed away by the blood of the Lord.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
