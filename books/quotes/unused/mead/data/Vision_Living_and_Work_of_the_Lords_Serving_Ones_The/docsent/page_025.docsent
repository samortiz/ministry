   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Coming out of Christ s Life and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Built Up as His Unique Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Peter said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus said, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens Matt 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the Lord continued, And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 . The word and at the beginning of the verse is crucial; it indicates that verse 18 is a continuation of verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From this verse we know that the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we lead people to salvation and to live the Christian life, we must also lead them to experience the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the anointing we experience Christ as life, and we also experience the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result of these experiences, the church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam and Eve are a wonderful type in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God did not first create a man and then create a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Genesis 1:27 says that God created male and female, according to chapter 2 He first created a man and then took a rib out of the man and built a woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these verses we see life, indicated by the rib, and building, indicated by the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The rib was something organic, and it came from Adam s body, out of the life of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This rib was merely the raw material of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God built this rib into a woman, Eve, who was Adam s other half.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam was only one half, and Eve was the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When these two halves were put together, they became one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Adam is a type of Christ, and Eve is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the cross Christ slept, and from His pierced side life flowed out John 19:34 , signified by the water, to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The life that flowed out of Christ is typified by the rib in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, it still needs to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life is for producing, and building is for accomplishing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament shows two important matters concerning the church: producing and accomplishing, that is, life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To produce is to regenerate so that we may have life, and to accomplish is to build so that the element of Christ may be built into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result is that the church is not only produced but also completely built up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The words in Matthew 16:16 and 18 are profound: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God...Upon this rock I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need light in order to see that these simple words are comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be brought out of the thick religious atmosphere into a clear sky in order to receive a revelation from the Father, who is in the heavens, so that we may know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the Son of the living God, the expression of God, the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is also the Christ, who came to accomplish God s economy to produce the church and to build up His unique Body as His unique counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows that the church is of life and is building; it is also unique and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God s creation He ordained that a husband have only one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This typifies Christ having only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the universe Christ has only one church, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE LORD S SPEAKING CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE CHURCH IN MATTHEW 18:17</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second time that the Lord Jesus spoke of the church is in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The context of this verse is quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a brother sins against you, you should go and reprove him between you and him alone to gain and recover him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he does not hear you, you should go to him again, taking one or two more brothers with you; and if he refuses to hear them, you should tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord is speaking of how to recover a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this context He mentions the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He then goes on to say that if the brother refuses to hear the church, Let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 16 speaks of the universal church, which is a matter of life and building, whereas chapter 18 speaks of the local church, which is a matter of administration and management.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From the context of chapter 18, we know that the church spoken of in verse 17 is involved with administration and management.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The universal church is of life and building, and the local church is of administration and management.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church has these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The universal church is uniquely one, and the local church in every locality is the expression of the one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church in Taipei is an expression of the universal church; so is the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No matter in which city the church is expressed, it is an expression of the unique church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can use the moon as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although there is only one moon, it can be seen from every city.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The moon that we see in Taiwan is the same moon that is seen in America; there are not two moons.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the same with the church; there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This church is expressed in Taipei, New York City, and Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is expressed in every locality is the unique universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Matthew 18 shows the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there is only the universal church and no local churches, where can the saints go when there are problems between the saints and there is a need to tell the church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, on the one hand, the church is universal, but on the other hand, the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you are in Taipei and you have a problem that you need to tell the church, it is easy to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank the Lord that wherever we are, there is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our knowledge of the church must include both the universal and the local aspects.</S>
