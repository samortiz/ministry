   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Not Asking Evilly</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should ask, but there is a second condition to prayer; we should not ask evilly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly James 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should ask God out of necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not ask mindlessly, unreasonably, or wildly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should never ask carelessly or evilly for any unnecessary things according to our lust or our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do, our prayers will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While God often gives us superabundantly above all that we ask or think Eph 3:20 , asking evilly is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Asking evilly means asking beyond one s capacity or real need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have a need, you can ask God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But you should only ask God to take care of your need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Asking beyond what you need is asking evilly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have a great need, it is not wrong to ask God to satisfy such a need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if you do not have a great need, and you ask for it, you are asking evilly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You can only ask according to your capacity and need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should never ask foolishly for this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Asking carelessly is to ask evilly, and such asking will not receive any answer from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Asking evilly before God is like a four-year-old child asking his father for the moon in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is not pleased with evil asking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every Christian should learn to confine his prayers within the proper scope.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not open your mouth rashly and ask for more than you actually need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. Dealing with Sins</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some do not ask evilly, but God does not answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because there is a basic barrier between them and God sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I regard iniquity in my heart, / The Lord will not hear Psa 66:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person has obvious and known sins in his heart, yet is unwilling to drop or part with them, the Lord will not answer his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Note the words in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord cannot answer a person s prayer when there is such a great hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does it mean to regard iniquity in my heart ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It means to keep a sin in one s heart, being unwilling to part with it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a person knows something is a sin, yet he continues to cherish it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not only a weakness in conduct or appearance but also a craving in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is different from the person spoken of in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the person in Romans 7 has failed, he hates what he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The person here, however, regards iniquity in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means he keeps the iniquity to himself and is unwilling and reluctant to let go of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sin remains not only in his conduct but also in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord will not hear such a one when he prays.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So long as there is one sin, it will hinder God from answering our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not keep any favorite sin in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should acknowledge all sins as sins and should put them under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord can sympathize with our weakness, but the Lord will not allow us to regard iniquity in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our prayers will not prevail if we have removed all the sins outwardly but still regard them in our heart and are unwilling and reluctant to part with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The moment we begin our Christian life, we have to ask for the Lord s grace to keep us from falling and to sanctify us in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we must thoroughly reject all sins in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not retain or regard any sin in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our prayer will be useless if sin remains in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord will not listen to such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Proverbs 28:13 says, He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: / but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must tell the Lord, I have regarded a sin in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I cannot give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I ask You to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I want to forsake this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please deliver me from this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not let this sin remain in me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you confess to the Lord this way, the Lord will forgive; you will receive forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then, your prayer will be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You must never be loose in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You will not receive anything if you do not ask.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You also will not receive anything if you ask evilly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if you do not ask evilly, the Lord will not answer your prayer as long as you keep back a favorite sin and regard it in your heart.</S>
