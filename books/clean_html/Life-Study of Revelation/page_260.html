<h2 class="head1">VI. SERVING GOD AND THE LAMB</h2><p>Revelation 22:3 also says, &ldquo;His slaves shall serve Him.&rdquo; To serve God and the Lamb will also be a blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. The pronoun &ldquo;Him&rdquo; in this verse refers to God and the Lamb; God and the Lamb are one in eternity. It is the same with &ldquo;His&rdquo; in the next verse.</p><p>Although God&rsquo;s redeemed will serve God and the Lamb in eternity, they will not serve Him as priests. Strictly speaking, in the new heaven and new earth there will be no priests. There will be service, but there will be no priesthood. Priestly service always includes the aspect of redemption. Because in the new heaven and the new earth there will no longer be the problem of sin, there will be no need for any redeeming work. Hence, there will be no priestly service there. Nevertheless, we shall still be the servants of God and of the Lamb, and we shall serve Him for eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. SEEING THE FACE OF GOD</h2><p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;And they shall see His face.&rdquo; This also is a blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. The &ldquo;His&rdquo; in this verse refers to both God and the Lamb. Seeing His face means seeing the face of God and the Lamb.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. HAVING THE NAME OF GOD<br />AND THE LAMB ON THEIR FOREHEAD</h2><p>God&rsquo;s redeemed will have the name of God and the Lamb on their forehead (v. 4). This is still another blessing of God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. We shall not have two names; we shall have just one name, the name of God and the Lamb. This is similar to Matthew 28:19, which speaks of being baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In eternity both God and the Lamb will have one name. Because we belong to Him, this name will be written on our foreheads forever. Not only shall we belong to Him; we shall also be one with Him.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. GOD ILLUMINING THEM</h2><p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them.&rdquo; Being illumined by the Lord God is another blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. We shall have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God. God Himself will shine upon us, and we shall live under His illumination.</p><h2 class="head1">X. REIGNING FOREVER</h2><p>Verse 5 also says, &ldquo;And they shall reign forever and ever.&rdquo; To reign forever will be the final blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity. These are the blessings we shall enjoy for eternity in the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
