   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING THE CHURCH WITH LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT, AND THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today there is a great debate concerning the way to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those in the Pentecostal movement say that the way to build the church is by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this is a shallow understanding of the way to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Pentecostal movement in the United States began at the turn of the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1906 it spread to Azusa Street in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this movement there was an outpouring and a burning from the Holy Spirit among the believers for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But later they found out that they could not build the church just with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Assemblies of God, one of the groups within the Pentecostal movement, made this discovery, set up a printing press, and began to educate their people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They told their people that they could not go out to build up the church by the Spirit alone; they had to build by the proper teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within the fifty years after the founding of the Assemblies of God in 1914, that denomination had the highest rate of increase among all the major Christian denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They increased because they exercised themselves in the matter of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is proof that in order to build up the church, there is the need of proper teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Southern Baptists also have stressed the matter of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have stressed the Word of God and have discouraged their preachers from speaking about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To them the Word is solid, but the Spirit is too abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have also depended upon the teaching of the Bible in their Sunday school classes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They use so-called laymen to teach the Sunday school classes, and they have built up their churches by the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others have said that to build up the Body of Christ, only life is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks was a typical example of those with this view.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I knew him very well, and I went to stay with him for about five weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was very strong not to use any teaching or doctrine, but to stress only life, especially the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the 1920s Brother Nee and I both appreciated his books.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In those years Brother Nee translated a number of his books into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Sparks was very much for the resurrection life, but he missed the importance of the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The effectiveness of his ministry in building up the church was diminished because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we have learned the lessons of church history, we stress life, the Spirit, and the truth continually.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The truth is a kind of doctrine or teaching, but not all doctrine or teaching is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to realize that these three things life, the Spirit, and the truth are of one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this verse the word, life, and the Spirit are combined together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then John 17:17 says, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to this verse, God's word, which may be considered as doctrine or teaching, is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the word, the Spirit, life, and the truth are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To receive "truth" from the word and yet not touch the Spirit is emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we touch the truth, we should touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit always goes along with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, the word and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word is the truth, and the truth is the Spirit 1 John 5:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, the Spirit is called "the Spirit of life" Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the word is the Spirit and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we touch the word as truth, we surely need to touch the Spirit, and this Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, there is no difference between the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is by these things life, the Spirit, and the truth that the church is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word, the Spirit, and life are all wrapped up with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we must learn to study the Word by exercising our spirit, and we must also learn to study with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever we study, we must turn into prayer, and then we must turn our prayer into our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the word in the Spirit becomes our experience, the issue is life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The issue of the word and the Spirit is the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The only way for us to grow is by touching the word with prayer and turning the word with prayer into the Spirit, which issues in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the life of the Spirit from the word, we can build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word is the base for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because they realize their shortage of the word, some of the elders invite speakers to come to their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this is the practice of the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The new way is to replace the speakers by equipping all the saints to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By the practice of prophesying, the need for the word on the Lord's Day morning is met.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, the burden of giving a message each Lord's Day would become a killing burden to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even when there are good speakers in a locality, after two years they will be exhausted, and the listeners will lose their taste for their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The God-ordained way is to replace the speaking of one or two speakers with the prophesying by all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To prophesy is not merely to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To speak may be to talk loosely, but to prophesy is to speak something from the Word with definite points.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The sisters as well as the brothers must prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The New Testament shows us clearly that the sisters can prophesy 1 Cor 11:5; 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the sisters should not teach with authority in the way of defining doctrine 1 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To do so is to overstep their limit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The sisters should prophesy to minister Christ, to minister life, to others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is for the building up of the church.</S>
