He Who Opens and Shuts</h2><p>Verse 7 also says that Christ is the One who &ldquo;opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.&rdquo; Because the universal key, the key of God&rsquo;s economy, is in His hand, He opens and shuts.</p><p>As we have pointed out, nearly everything found in the book of Revelation is not new but a fulfillment of things revealed in the Old Testament. This is also true of the key of David. Isaiah 22:22-24 is a prophecy concerning Christ as the One who holds the key of David. The deep thought in Christ&rsquo;s holding the key of David is found there. In Isaiah 22 it was prophesied that Christ would not only be the One holding the key of David, but that He would also be a nail or peg. Very few Christians have heard that Christ is a nail. If you consider the context of Isaiah 22 and if you read the context of the word regarding Christ as the One holding the key of David in Revelation 3, you will realize that Christ&rsquo;s holding the key of David is for God&rsquo;s house, for God&rsquo;s building. The crucial subject in Isaiah 22 is the house of God. And the epistle to the church in Philadelphia eventually speaks of the New Jerusalem. The overcomers in Philadelphia will be pillars in the temple of God, and the temple of God will ultimately be enlarged into the New Jerusalem. According to Revelation 21:22, there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, for, in eternity, the temple will be enlarged into a city, which, having three equal dimensions (21:16), will be the enlargement of the Holy of Holies. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s house. Christ&rsquo;s holding the key of David, fighting the battle for God, and building the temple and establishing the kingdom of God are all for God&rsquo;s building.</p><p>Christ holds the key of David and He opens and shuts, not that we might be holy or spiritual, but that we might be built up. He does not care for so-called holiness or spirituality. During the past two centuries, certain people claimed to be holy and spiritual. Although they saw something, they were rather short-sighted. Holiness is not for holiness, and spirituality is not for spirituality. Both holiness and spirituality are to enable us to be pillars in the temple of God. Eventually, we shall not bear the name of holiness or spirituality but of the New Jerusalem. In 3:12 the Lord did not say, &ldquo;I will write holiness upon you,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I will write spirituality upon you&rdquo;; He said, &ldquo;I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; What we have here is neither holiness nor spirituality but God and the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s purpose is not to make us holy or spiritual; it is to make us part of the New Jerusalem. God already has all the holiness He needs, but He does not yet have the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s desire is not for more spirituality. He is seeking the New Jerusalem. God desires a builded church. He wants today&rsquo;s Bethel, the house of God which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Are you willing to see this?</p><p>When I saw this light eighteen years ago, I made a strong declaration in my message that God does not want spirituality. Some opposers took this sentence out of context and said, &ldquo;Listen, Witness Lee says that we don&rsquo;t need spirituality and that God does not want spirituality.&rdquo; In that message I said again and again that any spirituality which is not for God&rsquo;s building is not genuine. Our spirituality must be tested by the church life. If our spirituality does not fit into the church life, it is an abnormal spirituality. It does not supply the Body; rather, it is a cancer. Many so-called spiritual persons are cancers. Cancer is a disease of the cells in the body. Unlike germs, cells are constituents of the body, and there is nothing wrong with them. But if the cells are not properly balanced and become too concentrated, they will develop into a cancer. The so-called spirituality that cannot be tested, adjusted, or balanced and that cannot fit into the building of the church is a cancer.</p><p>The Speaker to the church in Philadelphia holds the key of David, not to make us holy or spiritual, but to deal with us that we might be transformed and built up. Once we have been built up, He will become a nail to us, and we shall be the vessels hanging on Him. Firstly, Christ holds the key of David and eventually He holds us. Christ used the key to open the door of our prison. Before we came into the church life, we were all imprisoned. For example, some were imprisoned in the dungeon of Catholicism. But wherever we were, Christ, the One who holds the key of David, opened our prison and released us. According to our experience, all the doors opened for us by Christ are prison doors. Although the opposers are trying their best to imprison us, and to make the church a prison, we are released by the key held in the hand of Christ. As today&rsquo;s David, He has the key to open whatever God desires to open. Once He opens the door and we are released, we enter into the house of God where we become the household with many vessels held by Christ as the nail. If we remain in our mentality, we shall not have the realization or the sense of being held by Christ in this way. Nevertheless, Christ is the nail in God&rsquo;s house, and by this nail, we all are held up from the earth.</p><p>Firstly, Christ uses the key to release us from prison. After we have been released and have entered into the house of God, He becomes the nail holding us off the ground. The purpose of His doing this is that we might be transformed into a pillar in God&rsquo;s house. Eventually, we, the pillars, will become parts of the New Jerusalem. As we shall see, Christ&rsquo;s writing the name of the New Jerusalem upon us means that we have been transformed into a part of the New Jerusalem. If you see this, your view will be changed. In the past, you might have pursued holiness or spirituality, but you sought holiness and spirituality in an aimless way. You did not have God&rsquo;s goal in view. You did not see that both holiness and spirituality are for God&rsquo;s building. Today, Christ, the real David, uses the key to release us from prison. He then brings us into God&rsquo;s house that we might be transformed to be pillars and parts of the New Jerusalem. This is the church life, and this is the temple of God. Within this temple our Christ is a great nail holding us off the ground for God&rsquo;s building.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Revelation &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
