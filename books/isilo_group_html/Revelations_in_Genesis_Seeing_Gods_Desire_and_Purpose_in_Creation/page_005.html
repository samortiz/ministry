the Second Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light; and there was light.&rdquo; When the word of God comes, it brings in light. God&rsquo;s work always begins with light. God judges with darkness and restores with light. Darkness involves death in an old situation, but light generates a new situation. Water and darkness came in because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Therefore, God&rsquo;s restoration of creation involved the elimination of death and darkness by the Spirit and light.</p>
<p>The light in verse 3 signifies Christ as the light of the world (John 9:5; 8:12; 1:4-9; 12:46). The life of God enters into man through the shining of Christ. Wherever the light of Christ shines, there is life. Second Corinthians 4:6 says, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This means that the life of God shines into us through light. When the word of God comes, it brings light, and light brings life. Therefore, the coming of the word and of light is a requirement for generating life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Separating Light from Darkness&mdash;<br />
the Third Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:4-5 says, &ldquo;God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.&rdquo; Shining is the work of God, and the result of shining is separation. Nothing remains unseparated from darkness after being shined upon by God. Only that which is in darkness remains unseparated.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s work always separates light from darkness. God never allows that which is of Him to be joined to that which is of Satan. Second Corinthians 6:14-16 says, &ldquo;What partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? And what concord does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever? And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols?&rdquo; Light and darkness can never be joined; they must be separated.</p>
<p>The result of the separation of light from darkness is the establishment of day and night, the demarcation of which is related to light. God continued His work in the light in order to generate life. Therefore, the separation of light from darkness is also a requirement for generating life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Separating That Which Was Above<br />
from That Which Was Below&mdash;<br />
the Fourth Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:6-7 says, &ldquo;God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters. And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse.&rdquo; God separated light from darkness on the first day, and He separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse on the second day. Deep waters were on the surface of the earth, which was full of death, but God created an expanse to separate the death waters.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God does not only bring light; He also separates that which is above from that which is below. When the Spirit of God comes, light shines to separate that which is above from that which is below, the heavenly from the earthly, the spiritual from the fleshly, and that which is of God from that which is of the devil. These separations give God the ground to continue His work of generating life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Separating the Waters from the Land&mdash;<br />
the Fifth Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Verses 9 and 10 say, &ldquo;God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas.&rdquo; On the third day God did not create dry land; rather, He restored the land that had been judged and was covered by deep waters. By this time light had been separated from darkness, and the waters were separated from the land. God&rsquo;s work always involves a series of separations.</p>
<p>God separated the waters from the land in order to generate life, because water symbolizes death, and the land is where life is generated. Plants and animals grow on land. Hence, the land symbolizes life. However, the separation of that which was above from that which was below was not enough; life still had to be separated from death. With the separation of the waters from the land, all the requirements for generating life were met.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Generating the Plant Life&mdash;<br />
the Generation of Life</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so.&rdquo; When the five requirements for generating life were met, God began to create life on the third day. After dry land appeared, life was generated.</p>
<p>Our receiving the life of God followed this principle. We were fallen men living in sin, darkened in our understanding, and blinded by the evil one. We were completely alienated from the life of God because of our ignorance and the hardness of our heart (Eph. 4:18), and we were utterly ignorant of spiritual things. The wrath of God was abiding upon us (John 3:36). This was also the condition of the judged and cursed earth.</p>
<p>But because of His mercy, God sent His Spirit to touch us, and the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ shined upon us and manifested our darkened condition to us (2 Cor. 4:4). Then we understood that our past deeds were shameful and would end in death. We also realized that light is versus darkness, that what is heavenly is versus what is earthly, and that life is versus death. As a result, we repented of our past, rejected darkness, and accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior. Then the life of God entered into us to regenerate us, and we were saved. This shows that in order for the life of God to be generated in man, God must carry out several steps of His preparatory work. As soon as these requirements are met, the life of God is generated in man.</p>
<p>However, the life that is generated at this stage is like the immature plant life. The plant life is the lowest and most primitive form of life. Plant life does not have feeling or consciousness. This indicates that the condition of the life that we received when we were regenerated was immature; it was not yet solid, nor did it have a keen sense of feeling or consciousness. Hence, it is not sufficient for us to remain in this stage. We must grow.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Desire and Purpose in Creation &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
