   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Cast Himself Down</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from the Wing of the Temple a. Tempted to Make a Show</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That God Would Protect Him</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 5 says, Then the Devil took Him into the holy city and set Him on the wing of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Devil s first temptation of the new King was in the matter of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Defeated in this, he turned his second temptation to religion, tempting the new King to demonstrate that He is the Son of God from the wing of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 6 the Devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to His angels concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was no need for the Lord Jesus to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was simply a temptation to show that as the Son of God He was able to do things in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any thought of doing things miraculously in religion is a temptation of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second test is a matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most exciting thing in religion is miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the human concept, any religion that does not have miracles is powerless; the most powerful religion is a religion of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Satan brought the new King to the wing of the temple and tempted Him to leap down from it by saying that the angels would protect Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that you have never had the thought of doing this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In my early days I often thought of doing things to show people that I was a supernatural person and that I had supernatural powers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you not had this kind of concept in your Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes we are tested when there is a need to do something, and at other times we are tested when there is no need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this instance, there was no need for Jesus to leap down from the wing of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes there does seem to be a need for a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once my youngest brother-in-law became seriously ill.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time I was tempted to make a show of myself by praying for his healing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I thought, Now is the time for me to prove to my in-laws and relatives that I am a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I shall pray just one prayer, and my brother-in-law will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Doesn t the Bible say that Jesus heals, that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that we must pray for others?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I do this miracle for my brother-in-law, my mother-in-law will be convinced that I am a supernatural person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In her eyes I am too religious, daily talking about God, Christ, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Imagine what would happen if I went to my brother-in-law and said, Lord Jesus, heal him, and he immediately rose up!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only would he be healed, but I would be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a wonderful person I would be in the eyes of my mother-in-law!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Was that the Lord s anointing, the Lord s leading and guidance, or was it a temptation?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Surely it was a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you not had such a temptation in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many young Christians have peculiar concepts regarding the performing of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some may say, Since I am one following the Lord and I am in the Lord s presence as my Emmanuel, I must do something to show others that God is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I know of one dear brother who had such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Convinced that the Lord was with him, he asked the Lord to give him two hundred thousand dollars within a certain number of days.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said, Lord, You must show the people that You are one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You must show them that whatever I ask in Your name, You give me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, I am asking You for two hundred thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within a certain number of days, You must give it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This brother stopped eating and sleeping and began to pray for this amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What kind of prayer was that?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was leaping from the wing of the temple to make a show of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In principle we have all done this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every Christian has been tempted in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Devil does not tempt us in the matter of our living, he will tempt us in the matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may desire to be a great one in religion, to be recognized as a powerful person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone else must walk down from the wing of the temple, but you, a supernatural person, one who is more powerful than others, can leap down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By doing this you become great in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the religious big shots are those who have yielded to this temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you have become famous in Christianity, if you have succeeded in becoming recognized as a supernatural person, then you have already yielded to this temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You have already been defeated by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, if you desire to defeat the enemy in this test, you must not leap from the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, you must walk down from it as slowly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let others think that you are weak and incompetent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But you must tell yourself, I am not walking in power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am walking in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not care for power I care for life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is easy to say this, but it is difficult to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the opportunity presents itself, although you may not leap from the wing of the temple, you will run down, at least showing that you are a good runner, able to run faster than others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nevertheless, if we would defeat the enemy, we must be a nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Never do anything to prove that you are somebody or something.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let others think that you are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, I am nothing, and my Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you take the standing of being a nobody, you will kill the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You will slay the tempter.</S>
