<h1 class="title">THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONTENT<br />
OF THE NEW COVENANT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. CLEANSING</h2>
<p>We will now look specifically at the characteristics of the content of the new covenant. We have seen in previous chapters that according to Hebrews 8:10-12 the contents of the new covenant include three major parts. According to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, He first imparted His life and power into us; then He became our God in the law of life that we might be His people in the law of life, that we might have a deeper knowledge of Him, and that we might live Him out through us. Since forgiveness of sins is only a procedure by which to achieve His purpose, Scripture puts forgiveness of sins at the very end. However, according to our spiritual experience, we first obtain cleansing, that is, the cleansing which comes from forgiveness; then we become God&rsquo;s people in the law of life, and then we possess a deeper knowledge of God in an inward way.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the matter of forgiveness of sins. Hebrews 8:10 and 11 form one continuous thought, while verse 12 is another start. Notice the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in verse 12. It says, &ldquo;For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; shows us that God&rsquo;s being propitious to our unrighteousnesses and no longer remembering our sins occurs before we receive the life. In other words, what is mentioned in verse 12 occurs before that which is mentioned in verses 10 and 11. For this reason, the first thing to see is how our sins are forgiven and cleansed according to the covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Two Aspects of Sin</h2>
<p>According to the Scriptures, sin has two aspects: the nature of sin and the act of sin. The nature of sin is sin that dwells in man, mastering and governing him and inciting him to commit sins (Rom. 6:17; 7:20-21). Sinful acts are the sins which are manifested outwardly in our daily life. Concerning each of our sinful acts, whether small or great, hidden or deliberate, there is a charge against us before God. God has also passed judgment upon them (Rom. 1:32; 6:23). This causes our conscience to feel uneasy whenever we think of them. Whenever we are dominated by sin and struggle without release, we feel wretched within (Rom. 7:23-24). Therefore, the sinful acts need to be forgiven and cleansed, but we also need to be delivered and released from our sinful nature (Rom. 6:7, 22). Praise God, the blood of the Lord Jesus deals with the charges of sin against us before God and purifies our conscience (Matt. 26:28; Rev. 1:5; Heb. 9:14); and the cross of the Lord Jesus deals with our old man, delivering us from the power of sin and freeing us from sin itself (Rom. 6:6, 18). For this reason, when Romans 1:1 through 5:11 speaks of our sins before God, the blood is mentioned. When Romans 5:12 through chapter eight speaks of the sin that is in us, the same portion mentions the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ to annul the body of sin that we may no longer serve sin as slaves. Now let us see that our sins need to be forgiven and how they are forgiven and cleansed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sins Need to Be Forgiven</h2>
<p>Without exception everyone who has truly been quickened will be conscious of his own sins. For example, when the prodigal son in Luke 15 came to himself, he felt that he had sinned against Heaven and against his father. A person who is truly enlightened by the Holy Spirit cannot help but condemn himself concerning sin (John 16:8). It is at this moment he needs God&rsquo;s forgiveness. As soon as he sees his sin, he will consider the charges of sin against him before God; he will consider the punishment which his sin deserves; he will consider the unceasing pains of hell; and he will also hope to have a way to be saved. Perhaps at this time the gospel is preached telling how the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross and how He shed His precious blood for the forgiveness of sin (Matt. 26:28) that men might be washed of their sin (Rev. 1:5). When a person hears this gospel and believes, his sins are forgiven (Acts 10:43; 26:18) and his conscience is purified (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>Luke 7:36-50 shows that God&rsquo;s forgiveness may not mean much to a self-righteous Simon, but to a sinner who is considered &ldquo;what manner of woman&rdquo; (v. 39) by others, it is very much needed. All that this sinful woman had received her entire life was mockery and contempt. This only caused her to pity herself and feel ashamed of herself. But on this particular day there was One before her named Jesus, who appeared so holy and yet was so accessible&mdash;who even allowed her to stand behind Him weeping at His feet. Her weeping indicated several things: (1) her suffering because of sin, (2) the hidden story in her heart, (3) her helplessness, and (4) her hope for a Savior! However, her weeping did not obtain Simon&rsquo;s sympathy; it only caused him to be full of thought (v. 39). Weeping for sin simply could not be understood by a self-righteous person like Simon. But Jesus understood! First He corrected Simon; then He spoke on behalf of this weeping woman, saying that her many sins are forgiven (v. 47). Then speaking directly to the woman, He said, &ldquo;Thy sins are forgiven....Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace&rdquo; (vv. 48, 50). This forgiveness to her was a great gospel! It enabled her to no longer feel sorry for herself, but rather to be full of peace. This forgiveness henceforth would become a gospel to many great sinners.</p>
<p>Mark 2:1-12 shows us that to those self-righteous scribes, God&rsquo;s forgiveness was mere empty doctrine. It only caused them to criticize and judge the Son of God regarding His authority to forgive sins (vv. 6-7). But to the man sick of palsy, who was carried by four men, it was really beneficial. How many times sin causes not only torment in our heart, but ruin in our bodies! We realize that many illnesses are results of natural causes, contagion, or over exhaustion. But the Scriptures also indicate that some illnesses are the result of committing sin (Mark 2:5; John 5:14). When illness results from committing sin, whether obvious or hidden, the one who commits the sin knows. When a person commits sin which results in some incurable disease, all he can do is regret it; there is nothing more to say. The Lord knew that with this man sick of palsy, the cause of his illness was sin. For this reason He first spoke to the sick man, &ldquo;Son, thy sins are forgiven&rdquo; (Mark 2:5). Then He said, &ldquo;I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house&rdquo; (v. 11). The sins were forgiven and the sickness was healed. What a great gospel this is! Henceforth, this forgiveness would become a great gospel to many who were sick because of sin.</p>
