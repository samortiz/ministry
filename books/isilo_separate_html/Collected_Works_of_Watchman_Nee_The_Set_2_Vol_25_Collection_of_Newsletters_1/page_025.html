If we do not have them, there will be many problems. Many people are still in the denominations even though they have been meeting and breaking bread with us for many years. They still are not able to leave the denominations. It is true that they are brothers, but we cannot say that they are clear about the truth. Do you see this brothers and sisters? There must be these three letters of recommendation before many difficulties can be resolved.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: How do we know whether or not a letter of recommendation is genuine? If a brother from Chefoo went to P'ing Yang carrying a letter of recommendation, how would the brothers in P'ing Yang know that it was a genuine letter of recommendation? How can we know whether the letter was written by the locality the person came from?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: I have personally considered this matter also. According to my personal opinion, we should know the condition of the meetings in each locality and the names of the responsible brothers in each place. In this way, the number of forgeries can be greatly reduced. If a person comes from Chefoo with a letter of recommendation signed by Brother Witness Lee, we do not have to worry at all. This matter can be resolved simply. If his letter is a forgery and he has written several names on it by himself, we should know once we have seen the letter. Actually, all problems can be solved through fellowship, and the genuineness of a person can be proven through correspondence. For example, if a person comes from Fukien with a letter of recommendation asking us to receive him, we cannot refuse him. But after we receive him, we can write a letter to Fukien immediately, saying, "Thank the Lord, Brother So-and-so has arrived at our locality." If his letter is false, the meeting in Fukien will most certainly write a letter to tell us.</P><P>But according to my personal thought, this type of thing will not happen among us. I do not believe people will forge letters of recommendation for the purpose of coming to us. These letters are not checks; they cannot receive any money for them. Nor can they enjoy any special privileges with them.</P><P>However, I think one case is probable. If a brother among us has been excluded from the fellowship (he would certainly be clear about all the matters among us), he might go to Nanking with a false letter of recommendation to meet with the brothers there. But I think this matter can be resolved easily. After you receive a letter of recommendation, send a confirmation to Shanghai. In this way we can be at rest.</P><P>Brother Hu Chi T'ang answered: If you are afraid of forgeries, you can ask the locality sending the letter to write not only a letter for the brother, but also to write and send one to you directly.</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung said: The letters of recommendation should be written by the responsible brothers.</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee said: The letters of recommendation are also written by the elders. They are written by the ones responsible for the church in that locality. If any other brother writes the letter, then the brothers in the other localities will not know how many responsible brothers you have among you. They will not know which brothers are responsible for your affairs.</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung said: I think that the letters of recommendation should be written by the responsible brothers, and we should be able to recognize their handwriting. If it is that person's handwriting, we will know if it is genuine or false. Furthermore, the responsible brothers should not only sign the letters, but they should also affix their personal seal after their signatures; this is the best way.</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee said: You are right. I have thought that if we lack fellowship among ourselves to the extent that we do not recognize the handwriting of the responsible brothers in each locality, we are very short. When that happens, we do not need to wait for false brothers to come in among us; we already are not acting like genuine brothers.</P><P>Brother Shih Chiu Jung asked: Does a brother need to carry a letter of recommendation every time he goes out?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: I think we should carry letters of recommendation. We cannot say that we do not need a letter of recommendation because we know the people in that locality well. How will the people in that place know whether or not you recently have been excluded from the fellowship? How will they know whether or not you have had some problems? The only way to know is by letters of recommendation. In this way, if we carry letters of introduction each time, we can avoid many problems. Please remember that we should do everything to avoid problems for others.</P><P>For example, Brother Lee has been among us for two or three months. On Tuesday he will return to Chefoo. I should write a letter of recommendation for him to take back to Chefoo telling the brothers in Chefoo that he did not have any problems in Shanghai. If he were really excluded from the fellowship in Shanghai but we did not write a letter to tell the meeting in Chefoo, they would still receive him when he returned to Chefoo. In this way they would overturn his exclusion from fellowship, would they not? Therefore, every time a brother or sister leaves us to return to his original locality, it is best that we write a letter of recommendation.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: If a brother goes out and plans to visit several meetings in one trip, how should we write that letter of recommendation?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: If we go on a trip to visit several churches but we do not have a specific locality in which we plan to stay for a long while, we do not need to give our letter of recommendation to the brothers of any one locality. We only need to show it to them and then put it back into our own pocket. If there is a brother who wants to visit every locality (there are more than one hundred churches), the letter of recommendation should not be addressed to any one church. For example, he may arrive at a locality on the Lord's Day in time for the meeting. He should go in before the table. But if he does not have time to fellowship with them, he can place his letter of recommendation on the table and sit down, and the matter should be settled. If they believe him, that would be the end of the story. If they do not believe him, they can open the letter and read it. After the meeting, he can still take the letter back. Then he can go to the next locality on the following day. In this way our letters of recommendation are something like a passport issued by the government.</P><P>(This article is the record of a discussion we had after the Third Overcomer Conference.
