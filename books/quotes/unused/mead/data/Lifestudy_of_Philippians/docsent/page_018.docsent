   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE SIX MAGNIFYING CHRIST BY LIVING HIM Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the matter of magnifying Christ by living Him 1:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 20 Paul said, According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Paul s bodily sufferings, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great shown to be without limitation , exalted, and extolled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only Christ would he have magnified in him, not the law or circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Philippians is concerned with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. MAGNIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 20 a number of expressions are related to Paul s statement that Christ would be magnified in him: with all boldness, as always, even now, in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul does not simply say with boldness, but says with all boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then he specifically points out that Christ would be magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said this because his body was in chains.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At least during the night, if not all the time, Paul was chained to a guard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, even though his body was in chains, Christ would be magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, Christ would be magnified whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that no matter what the circumstances were, Paul expected Christ to be magnified in him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we must consider what it means to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word magnify means to make something large to our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps you are wondering how Christ can be magnified since He is already universally great.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Ephesians 3, the dimensions of Christ the breadth, length, height, and depth are immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are the dimensions of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of the praetorium, the imperial guard of Caesar, Christ was virtually nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In their eyes, there was not such a person as Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, some eventually turned to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Evidence of this is found in 4:22, where Paul speaks of the saints of Caesar s household.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through Paul s magnification of Christ, even some in Caesar s household were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the time of Paul s imprisonment, the Jews were despised by the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Romans were the conquerors, and the Jews were the conquered ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among these conquered ones there was a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although He is great and most wonderful, in the eyes of the Romans He was nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But as Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him to appear great in the eyes of his captors.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our daily living we also should magnify Christ, making Him great in the eyes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where you work or go to school people may look down on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They may ridicule Him and take His name in vain, in violation of the third commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, you need to let others see Christ not in a small way, but in the way of enlargement, of magnification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should also magnify Him at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The parents of some of the young people may not believe in Christ, but rather may despise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, these young people must bear the responsibility to enlarge Christ before their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of simply preaching to their parents about Christ, they need to magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need not simply the life within, but also the living without.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through the proper living Christ will appear to be great in the eyes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Young people, let your parents see Christ s greatness in you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can magnify Christ even in situations where we have little or no liberty to speak about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although teachers may not be able to preach the gospel to their students, they can magnify Christ in the classroom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They can cause Christ to appear great in the eyes of their students.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not believe that when Paul was in prison, he was free to do much preaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, he was very limited and under strict control.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, even in such circumstances, Christ was magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With all boldness Paul sought to magnify Him always.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul says that Christ would be magnified in him whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter what faced him the opportunity to go on living or martyrdom Paul expected to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In his living Paul magnified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to magnify Him through life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As he was expecting to be martyred, he also magnified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is to magnify Christ through death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, whether through life or death, Christ was magnified in Paul s imprisoned and chained body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Obviously this is not mere doctrine; it is the genuine experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In verse 19 Paul mentions the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we allow the bountiful supply of the Spirit to work in us, our daily living will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We shall be burdened to magnify Christ always and with all boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through our magnifying of Christ, others will see His greatness and His unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To magnify Christ in such a way surely is to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was an elderly person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No doubt, the guards expected him to be exhausted by his imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But far from being exhausted, Paul was full of joy and rejoicing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am confident that he was shining forth Christ and expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ and a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our love is eventually exhausted, but Christ as love is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Likewise, our natural patience is limited, but Christ as our patience is without limit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all have the capacity to be patient, but only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then we become provoked and angry.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For example, a brother may exercise patience with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eventually, however, this patience reaches its limit, and he becomes angry with her.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although our natural patience is so limited, Christ as patience is inexhaustible and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could be happy and display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In particular, Paul displayed Christ s inexhaustible patience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ certainly was magnified in Paul s physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Day by day, Paul was happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His happiness did not diminish as time went by.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In his happiness he could show forth the immeasurable Christ he experienced and enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>By this way Paul expressed, exhibited, exalted, and extolled Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I do not believe that Paul was offended by the jailers or that he offended them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, he was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The guards may have considered Paul to be strange or peculiar, viewing him as possessing something which they did not have.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What they sensed in Paul was Christ magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>While he was in prison, Paul expressed the greatness of Christ in an enlarged way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He magnified Christ with all boldness both through life and through death.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>By magnifying Christ in this way, Paul could overcome any situation.</S>
