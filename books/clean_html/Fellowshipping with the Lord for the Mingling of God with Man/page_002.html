<h1 class="title">THE TWO ASPECTS OF PRAYER<br />
BEING FELLOWSHIP AND INQUIRING</h1>
<p>A person who is used by the Lord must be a person of prayer. The apostles said that they would &ldquo;continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). To carry out the ministry of the word is to work for the Lord and to be used by Him. Prayer enables a person to work for the Lord and to be used by Him. The apostles could be used by the Lord because they continued steadfastly in prayer. A person who neglects prayer cannot be used by the Lord. In terms of function, the two aspects of prayer are fellowship and inquiring.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER FOR FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Filled with God<br />
and Letting God Flow out of Us</h2>
<p>The first function of prayer is to use our spirit to fellowship with God, that is, to contact and absorb God with our spirit. Our fellowship with God gives Him the opportunity to reveal Himself in us and to transfuse Himself into us so that our mind, emotion, and will are gradually mingled with Him. In this way, God can reveal His intention to us so that we may understand His will. Furthermore, while God operates within us, He exposes and deals with our weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. Hence, the first aspect of prayer is to fellowship with God by contacting Him and by letting Him mingle with us and clear up our problems.</p>
<p>When we enter into God&rsquo;s presence, we must consider fellowshipping with Him to be of primary importance. We should not begin with petitioning. Rather, we should first turn to our spirit, behold the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s face, and wait for His operating, enlightening, revealing, anointing, infusing, mingling, filling, and saturating. We should also let the Lord expose our weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. If we are willing to thoroughly confess these problems, our conscience will be at peace and without condemnation, and our spirit will be filled with His presence. At this time, we can mention to the Lord the things that we want to pray for.</p>
<p>In the past we have said that we should continually fellowship with the Lord in spirit, but such continual fellowship is often not deep or thorough. Hence, in addition to constant, spontaneous fellowship with the Lord, we must set aside an amount of time in order to focus on turning away from everything other than the Lord and contacting Him in the depths of our spirit. In this time His work in us is often deep and thorough and causes us to prostrate ourselves before Him. As a result, we sense our mistakes, and we are willing to let our mind be broken, our insubordinate will be subdued, and our impure emotion be purified.</p>
<p>Such deep and quiet fellowship enables the Lord to reach every part of our being so that we are subdued, broken, purified, occupied, and possessed by Him. It is during such a time of prayer that the Lord can mingle with us in a deep and thorough way. This is how we pray ourselves into the Lord, absorb Him, fellowship with Him, and are mingled with Him. This is when the Lord touches our mind, emotion, and will, and we are subdued, purified, broken, occupied, and possessed by Him. Furthermore, we are mingled with the Lord, His will is revealed in us, and He can then anoint us with a burden for His work.</p>
<p>The result of our being filled and saturated with God is that the river of water of life can freely flow out of us. Therefore, prayer causes us to be used by God. Prayer causes us to flow out the divine life into others, that is, to impart God into others. This is what it means to be used by God. Every believer who desires to be used by God should learn to pray in such a way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in Fellowship</h2>
<p>The prayer that we are talking about seems to be rather similar to what is ordinarily referred to as the prayer during devotions and retreats; actually, there is a big difference. The believers who promote devotional prayer often do not contact the Lord regularly or live in fellowship with the Lord. They have a set time for spiritual pursuit. This is not what we are referring to. We need to fellowship regularly with the Lord and live in this fellowship. It is not that we fellowship with the Lord only during our time of prayer. We must live in moment-by-moment fellowship with the Lord. However, since we sense that such regular fellowship with the Lord is not deep or thorough, we also set aside time to seek deeper fellowship with Him. If we do not live in constant fellowship with the Lord, our fellowship during a specific time of prayer will not be deep or thorough. If we desire to have thorough fellowship with the Lord during our prayer time, we must live in constant fellowship with Him.</p>
