        <h2 class="head1">A PROPER FOCUS</h2>
<p>A believer should focus on grace, not on things. Matthew 6:31-32 says, &ldquo;Do not to be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&rdquo; The Gentiles seek only to exist on the earth; they do not know the purpose of their existence. They think that by solving the problems related to their basic necessities&mdash;such as food, clothing, dwelling, and transportation&mdash;they have solved the problems of human life. They do not understand that even when their need for basic necessities is met, one problem will remain unsolved, which is that they have not received God as their life. The provisions of food and clothing are God&rsquo;s care related to His procedure for their existence so that they can obtain God Himself as grace. This is His purpose. People who receive these provisions but do not receive God are merely in His procedure; they are not in His goal. Gentiles do not know God&rsquo;s goal; hence, they seek only outward blessings. As God&rsquo;s children, we should not seek merely outward blessings; we should seek grace. We should seek to gain God more than we seek things and matters outside of God. We should enjoy being filled with God more than we enjoy outward material things.</p>
<p>We need to seek grace, but this does not mean that we do not need God&rsquo;s outward care. We cannot exist without the outward care. For the sake of our existence, God measures out to us necessary things for our existence so that we may receive Him and be filled with Him. We must know, gain, experience, and be filled with God. Otherwise, everything that we know and pursue will be outward.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:8 Paul says that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ. The expression <em>all things</em> refers to the outward things that are treasured by many. To Paul such things were dung; hence, he forsook and despised them so that he might gain Christ. To gain Christ is to gain the manifested God. This is also to receive grace.</p>
<p>Outward things and matters are a procedure to enable us to gain God. Whenever outward things and matters become the goal of our human life, they hinder and usurp us from gaining God. We should count such things as dung and put them aside. Regardless of how good or valuable a thing may be, if it hinders us from gaining God and from being filled with Him, we should despise it, condemn it, and forsake it. The life of God is a treasure in us (2 Cor. 4:7), and God is our excellency (Phil. 3:8). In order to pursue and gain this treasure, this excellency, it is worthwhile to despise and forsake outward things. We should pursue the treasure, the excellency, more than we pursue outward things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING GRACE</h2>
<p>Blessings refer to matters, things, and environments, which are a procedure that enables us to receive grace. Grace is God in us to be our life and power. Hence, no matter what environment, matter, or thing that we encounter, we should know, experience, and gain more of God.</p>
<p>In Philippians Paul says that he had learned, in whatever circumstances he was, to be content. He knew how to be abased and how to abound. In everything and in all things he had learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. He was able to do all things in Christ who empowered him (4:11-13). Paul&rsquo;s circumstances and situations caused him to depend on the Lord, experience Him, and gain Him more, that is, to gain more of God. In every situation Paul grasped one thing: he depended on the Lord, experienced Him, and gained Him. This was Paul&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says that he labored more abundantly than the rest of the apostles, but it was not him who labored but the grace of God which was with him. Paul knew that God was grace in him, and he depended on this grace and experienced this grace. He knew that the grace of God in him was sufficient and was his power (2 Cor. 12:9). For this reason, he depended on this grace and experienced this grace in every environment. Some believers are good Christians when they do not have any lack, but they are defeated when they experience a lack or a trial. This shows that they do not adequately know grace. When other believers experience a lack, they receive grace. Some may think that it is impossible to bear such a lack, but there is grace, power, in these believers that causes them not only to endure the lack but even to love their condition. This power is the grace of God in them and with them, enabling them to know, enjoy, experience, and gain God in the midst of their lack.</p>
<p>There are still other believers who are strong and maintain their fellowship with the Lord when there is a lack, but when the situation turns for the better, they fail the test of abundance. God does not only place us in situations of lack. He will also place us in situations of abundance. Some people are able to withstand the trial of lack but cannot withstand the test of abundance. They are defeated by abundance. They are short of the grace to deal with the test of abundance. Abundance is not only a test; it can also become a temptation. Many people cannot withstand the temptation of abundance. Paul received grace, was filled with God, and depended on the Lord; hence, he could be abased, and he could abound. Neither lack nor abundance could drag him down; instead, they gave him the opportunity to experience and gain God. Having a lack caused Paul to experience and gain God, and being in abundance also caused him to experience and gain God. There was not one circumstance that could prevent him from experiencing and gaining God. All his outward circumstances caused him to experience grace and to obtain grace.</p>
<p>If we have God&rsquo;s grace and His presence as our power, every circumstance will become an opportunity for us to receive more grace. If we know the grace of God, we will say, &ldquo;I want to lose all the outward things and matters so that I may receive grace. O Lord, if poverty can cause me to gain more of You, I would rather choose poverty. If being abased and despised can cause me to gain You more, let me be abased and despised. If sickness can cause me to gain You, I would rather have sickness than be healthy.&rdquo; To gain God is higher than to gain outward blessings.</p>
<p>May all God&rsquo;s children see what grace is and what it means to receive grace. We do not want to lose grace, nor do we want to lose any opportunity to receive grace. May we be those who testify in the meetings of touching God, experiencing God, and receiving grace.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
