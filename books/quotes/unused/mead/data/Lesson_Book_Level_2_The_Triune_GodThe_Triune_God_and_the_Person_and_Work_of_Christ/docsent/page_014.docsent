   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament begins with the birth of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think, though, that we cannot see the Father, Son, and Spirit in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, the Old Testament is full of the Triune God for our experience; it is just that He is still somewhat hidden and presented in symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But what is often very hard to describe with words can be understood much better by seeing a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is true of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With the help of the New Testament to explain the pictures in the Old Testament, we will see how excellent and experiential our God is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first sentence in the Old Testament states, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Hebrew language the subject "God" is triple in number, whereas the verb "created" is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that God is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the very first verse of the whole Bible, we see that God is triune!</S>
