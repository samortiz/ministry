   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b God's Calling</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second factor of the motive and strength was God's calling Acts 7:3-4; Gen 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God did not appear to Abraham without speaking to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When He came to Abraham, He called him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God spoke to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Calling means speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not a small thing to hear God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time we were saved, we all experienced the appearing of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time that He appeared to us, He spoke to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was a divine speaking, a kind of speaking in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many of us can testify that at the time we were saved, deep within us we had the consciousness that Jesus was speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps the Lord Jesus came to you when you were a student and said, "What are you doing here?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You answered, "I am studying to get my degree."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the Lord asked, "For what?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You replied, "To make a good living in the future."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this, the Lord asked, "Then what?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What about your future?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With others, the Lord Jesus has spoken in a different way, saying, "Look at how sinful you are, at how bad and poor you are!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In response to this, some have said to the Lord, "Don't bother me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the Lord said, "I love you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I want to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't you know that I'm Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want to rescue you from your poor situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Aren't you willing to take Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To others of us the Lord Jesus said, "Don't you know that I am the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am the only One who can give you eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of us have heard words such as these, not out of the mouth of a preacher but out of the mouth of the living Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you recall the kind of speaking you heard from the living Jesus when He appeared to you at the time you were called and saved?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The non-Christians, including the professing Christians, have not had this kind of experience and they consider it as superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But it is not superstition!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The God of glory has come to us and spoken to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham could say, "Don't tell me that this is a superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I heard Him speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, 'Get thee out of thy country!'</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This word did not come from my father or from my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was spoken by the God of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tell me honestly, have you not heard the speaking of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not believe that any saved person will ever be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although a saved one may backslide, he can never forget the appearing and the speaking of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He might even say, "I don't believe in Jesus anymore," but deep within the Lord says, "How can you say that you don't believe in Me anymore?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can never forget His appearing and His speaking to you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A good number of young people have asked me what is the difference between a true Christian and a false Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of them profess to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The best answer that I can give is this: a true Christian has had the speaking of Jesus, but the professing Christian only has the preaching of a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A genuine Christian has, at least once, heard the speaking of Jesus by the living Spirit directly in the depths of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That speaking was the strength that enabled all of us to accept God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>c God's Promise</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third aspect of the motive and strength to accept God's calling is God's promise 12:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most of God's speaking to us is His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God says, "I don't want to bother you; I want to save you," that is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If He says, "I love you," that also is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most of what He speaks to us is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What did the God of glory say to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Firstly, the God of glory said, "Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred" 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may think that this was not a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But it implied a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When God told Abraham to get out of his country, it implied that God was promising Abraham a place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, Abraham would have said, "If I get out of my country, where should I go?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God had a place for Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even the command to get out of the country implied a promise, the promise of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Abraham could say, "Since God commands me to get out of my country, this must surely mean that He has a place for me."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God told Abraham to get out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house, unto a land that He would show him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That certainly was a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's promise was an incentive for him to leave his country.</S>
