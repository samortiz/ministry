<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Additional Letter Written<br>by the Brothers and Sisters of Kuang Jau<br>to Leave the Denominations</H2><P>Greetings to the director of the Kuang Jau<br>Christian Presbyterian Church:</P><P>The Bible is the standard for the beliefs and practices of Christians. All decisions about the faith should have the Bible as the highest court of appeals. After carefully studying the matter of denominations, we have found that it is not only not in the Bible, but it is also forbidden by the Bible, because Christ is not divided (1 Cor. 1:10-13; Gal. 5:20). The Lord Jesus prayed, "Keep them..that they may be one" (John 17:11). The word in Acts 15:14 says, "To take out from them a people for His name." Second Corinthians 6:14-18 commands the believers to separate themselves from the unbelievers. It does not command the believers to separate themselves from other believers. The Bible forbids divisions of the Body (1 Cor. 12:25). For this reason, we will not confess to being the member of any denomination from now on in order to obey God's Word and to keep the oneness among all the children of God. We will only confess that we are Christians, and we will meet in the Lord's name according to the Bible. We will fellowship with all the children of God according to the regenerated life. We do this, not as a matter of personal affection, but to leave the denominational names. We are not leaving the brothers and sisters in the Lord. When we meet, we are still friends. In conclusion, those in the denominations are not unsaved, but the Bible says that believers cannot denominate themselves. We are not leaving the denominations in a hasty way. We have spent much time in study before taking this step. We are explaining our action to you with this letter. We greet you.</P><P>Sincerely,<br>Nieh Tao Hung, Nieh Tao Sheng, Nieh Fu Sheng,<br>Nieh Yun Chi, Nieh Cheng En<br>July 17, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM THE MEETING IN KU T'IEN,<br>FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>To Brother Ho, whom I do not forget before the Lord:</P><P>I received the card and the bundle of tracts. Thank you. I also received the Bible and other books a few days ago. I think you must have already received my letter of response. Our meeting (the Lord's table) began on July 8 (a Lord's Day), and our gospel meeting did not begin until July 15. Only thirty to forty came to our gospel meeting this time because the rain hindered some. Most of those who came were from the various denominations. There were also many students. We now have the prayer meeting on Wednesday afternoons at 4:00. There is a children's meeting at 9:00 Saturday morning. On the Lord's Day, the table meeting is at 9:00 in the morning, and the gospel meeting is at 3:00 in the afternoon. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>When I first arrived in Ku T'ien, I went and testified in the four denominational schools and one chapel here. At that time, I only preached salvation and expounded on the various aspects of salvation. Therefore, they were all very happy to come to my meetings. Even the pastors in the denominations did not oppose much. But now they have begun to attack. They are afraid that their members will leave them because we have begun to meet separately. Therefore, every Lord's Day, they preach against us. We preach salvation by faith, so they preach salvation by works based on James 2. Thank the Lord, there are quite a few people in each school who understand salvation by faith. Even many who are not saved know that salvation is by faith. After the pastor began preaching this way, many people began to worry that he was not yet saved. On June 30, I baptized some brothers, and the pastor began to preach that baptism was a ritual and said that we were the Baptist Church. When the brothers and sisters did not go to his chapel to worship, he preached Luke 4:16 on Sunday to rebuke us. He said we did not follow the Lord Jesus in going into the synagogue according to custom. The enemy is setting traps to hinder us, but we know that the foolishness of those who oppose the truth will be exposed (2 Tim. 3:8-9).</P><P>The house which the Lord prepared for us is also very marvelous. Originally this house was rented to someone else. The brothers all felt that this house was good because (1) it is separate from other houses, and there are no houses connected to it, and (2) it is in a good, quiet, central location. For this reason we begged the Lord strongly. Later, the Lord accomplished it for us. The Lord also prepared everything that we need in the meetings now.</P><P>Brother Chung left us yesterday to return to Foochow because he received a telegram from his family. Our hearts were very sad. At this time the number of our co-workers should have increased instead of decreased. However, this is the Lord's arrangement, and we should also praise the Lord. Our hymn is #61.</P><P>Now only Brother Wei and myself are living in the room next to the meeting place. If the Lord is willing, we would also like to study Bible Studies for Beginners for those who desire the Word, but we do not know the Lord's time. If we wait until the schools are in session, we think we can also help more than a few dozen students. We have begun to pray for this matter now. Brothers, if you feel a burden before the Lord, please do not forget to pray for all these matters. I believe the strength of the work depends completely on your prayer and ours. If Brother Shen, Brother Witness Lee, Brother Lee Teh Hsiu, Brother Fu Feng Yen, Brother Tai En Chao, or Brother Sun Hung En want to know about the condition of Ku T'ien and want to bear the burden in prayer, please show them this letter.</P><P>Brother, you know that the most difficult thing to deal with is the people who have joined us from all the denominations. We must first tear down before we can build up. Most of what fills their brains is not the truth. At present there are many questions before us that need our explanation. If the Lord Himself does not do it, there is really no way. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Brother, I do not have time to tell you everything in detail. I will tell you later if I have the chance. I bless you with victory. Greetings to the brothers!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Pi Yin<br>July 18, 1934</P><P>Mailing Address: 1 Er Pao Hou Alley, Ku T'ien, Fukien</P>
