<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING AND NOT REPLACING</h2>
<p>There are three steps in the building up of the church. The Lord first gives gifts to the church, and the gifts perfect the saints in different places. Then the perfected saints are able to function according to their measure because their organic function has been activated through the perfecting. As a result, the perfected saints are the ones who build up the church directly. To perfect means to make a person useful. Hence, to perfect a saint is to make him useful in the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Does a worker build up the church in a locality directly, or does he perfect others? The direct building up of the church should be carried out by the perfected saints, not by the workers. A worker perfects the saints; he does not build up the church directly. If we labor in a locality, but the building of the church stops after we leave, our work is wrong. What kind of work are we doing? Are we building up the church directly? Of course, there is a portion of the building up that we do directly according to our function, but our primary work is to perfect the saints. Otherwise, what will happen if we, like Philip, are suddenly caught away (Acts 8:26, 39)? What will the churches do if we are suddenly raptured? Whether we are raptured will not matter, if the saints are perfected and can build up the church directly.</p>
<p>If we, the workers, build up the church directly, we are replacing the saints in the building up of the church. However, the fact that we perfect the saints to build the church does not mean that we absolutely do not build up the church directly. Rather, it means that we perfect the saints instead of replacing them. Some saints do not know how to build up the church, so we teach them. Other saints are not able to build up the church, so we perfect them and make them able. We do not replace the saints, but we perfect them and let them do the building work directly. This needs our consideration.</p>
<p>The ability to accomplish a task by yourself is not necessarily an indication of great capacity. However, a worker who can teach the saints to do something better than he can, truly has great ability. The workers should perfect the saints. Then the saints will be as capable or even more capable than the workers.</p>
<p>We should not replace the saints in the building up of the church; rather, we should perfect the saints. We should make the saints useful and let them build up the church directly. We may think that we are very clear about this principle, but we may be clear only while we listen to a message. We may not be clear when we serve in our localities. Our work proves that we are still not clear concerning this principle. Some workers say that since they are neither an apostle nor a prophet, they cannot perfect anyone. In their display of humility, they even ask whom they should perfect. Although this sounds right, their words are used to enable them to continue to replace the saints. This is not right. Under no circumstance should we replace the saints. It is not a matter of whether we are gifted but of whether we can perfect others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS PERFECTING<br />
THE SAINTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH DIRECTLY</h2>
<p>The elders and the saints responsible for the group meetings must remember this principle. When they labor, they must perfect the saints. Otherwise, their work replaces the saints. For example, the elders know how to administrate the church. When an elder labors, he should have some saints with him in order to perfect the saints. The saints responsible for the meetings must also labor by this principle. A brother may work in such a way that the more he works, the more responsibility he bears; however, the other saints participate less, and he is unable to perfect the saints. In this situation his work is not proper.</p>
<p>The apostles, prophets, and even the saints responsible for the meetings must work according to this principle. Initially, the elders bear the responsibilities in a church. The saints who are raised up to share the responsibilities tend to do everything themselves because few saints are perfected to serve. However, after the responsible saints serve for a few months, they should bring other saints into bearing responsibilities. This does not mean that the responsible saints lightly relinquish their responsibilities. The responsible saints perfect the saints by serving the saints. They should teach the saints according to the ability of the saints. A saint can be taught to bear responsibility, and if he makes a mistake, he can be corrected. Soon he will be able to bear responsibility by himself.</p>
<p>Then another saint can be taught to bear responsibility. In two or three years all the saints will be able to do what you are able to do. In addition, when the number of saints in a meeting increases to a hundred saints, the meeting should split into two meetings. Then there will be many saints who can bear responsibility in the new meeting, because they were perfected by the leading of the responsible brothers.</p>
<p>In the building up of the church it is crucial for the saints who know how to build to perfect the other saints to build. In principle, the gifts know how to build up the church. We may say that there is no prophet or apostle in our locality, but we must admit that we can build up the church a little; we do have a little gift. A brother who has a desire to serve in a locality for five years must have a &ldquo;five-year plan.&rdquo; What will happen to the saints when he leaves? Will the church become weak and &ldquo;close its doors,&rdquo; or will it continue to function with a stronger service? Whether a local church will be able to continue after we leave is what matters.</p>
<p>A person who knows how to work will always seek to perfect others. This does not mean that he does less work. Rather, he works more than the rest of the saints, because most of his work is to perfect the saints. After he has served for three to five years, the saints can do and are doing whatever he can do. This requires a great deal of consideration. This is the way for us to build up the church. Leading others to be spiritual does not mean that we are building up the church, because to be spiritual is not the same as to be useful. We may lead others to be spiritual without leading them to exercise their function according to their measure. Hence, there are many spiritual saints in the church, but there is not much building.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for this frank word. I serve and work with you, and I am responsible before the Lord to observe the condition of the localities. Perhaps you feel that I cannot understand your situation because I am not in your locality, and I did not fellowship with you. However, there may not be another person who is as concerned for your situation as I am.</p>
<p>Some of the workers lack spiritual weight in their work, and therefore there is no result. Some workers render spiritual help to the saints, but they do not perfect the saints to be useful. The saints whom they serve do not become useful. A good carpenter can use wood of any quality to make something useful. However, even though some of our workers render the saints spiritual help, the saints are still not useful vessels. This can be compared to a carpenter who works on different pieces of wood until the pieces are smooth and have nice colors but are not useful. They are just pieces of wood; nothing useful, like a desk or chair, has been produced.</p>
<p>We need to see our lack and be humbled. It is foolish for us to be proud. If a local church has been in our hands for many years, what is the result? We should not be proud. Our condition should humble us. Many saints have passed through our hands; we contacted and led them. How many of these saints did we perfect to become useful? We should not say that we have poor quality material. Some of the material may be poor, but not all the material is poor. The problem is not the quality of the material; it is whether we can make useful vessels out of the material that we have. It may be a waste to make a chair out of top quality wood, but the chair is useful. It may be an even greater waste to make a chair out of pure gold or diamond, but the chair can still be used. Even if we use wood of the poorest quality, the chair will be useful. Hence, it does not depend on the kind of material that we have but on whether we have perfected the material. The saints in our locality may be &ldquo;poor quality wood.&rdquo; They might not be good material, much less gold or diamond, but we still must make them into something useful.</p>
<p>The building up of the church is not done directly by the gifts but by the gifts perfecting the saints. The perfected saints then build up the church directly. In principle, the gifts are the saints who know how to do things. A believer who receives the Lord&rsquo;s grace is able to do things. However, the Lord does not want us to do things by ourselves. He wants other saints to accompany us when we do things so that they can be perfected to do what we do. We must learn how to perfect the saints; otherwise, the church will not be built up.</p>
<p>This problem is not obvious in smaller churches. In the larger churches, however, it is visible. This problem is the reason that the church in Taipei is not built up. The saints who met in the six or seven district meetings were not built up. Even after we formed twenty smaller meetings, the saints were still not built up, because few saints know how to perfect others. There are many saints who know how to do things, but they do not know how to perfect others. The church needs a group of saints who not only know how to do things but also know how to teach others to do the same things and thereby perfect them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to give examples of spiritual matters because they are abstract. Business affairs, however, are concrete and clear. Some saints are very good at doing things in the large meetings, but they do not know how to perfect others. As a result, there were not enough saints who could handle the church affairs when we formed smaller districts and needed more responsible saints. Hence, the church affairs suffered. This shows that our urgent need is to learn to perfect others. If there are not enough perfected saints, the church cannot be built up, and our numbers will not increase. Moreover, when there are not enough perfected saints, any increase makes the meetings chaotic. If we have only three or four stones, they do not need to be built. But thousands of stones must be built; otherwise, there will be chaos. Even if the stones are polished and look nice, they are of no use because they are not built; they are a pile of stones. For the sake of the building up of the church, we must have a plan to perfect the saints.</p>
<p>The material in the church is for building; it is not for display. Construction workers build with materials; they do not beautify materials. However, some co-workers only beautify the building materials. They do not know how to perfect others, which is the real building. The saints who know how to perfect others are genuine co-workers of God.</p>
