   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outwardly, we are justified, having Christ as our righteousness, but inwardly we are still empty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we need Christ to be something else to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need Christ as the divine life, the divine life that is wrought into our inner being Jer 31:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This life is a law which works in us to dispense into our being all that God is in His rich being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result of this dispensing, this transfusing of God Himself into us, we are no longer empty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the contrary, we are filled with the dispensing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The inner law of the divine life within us has the capacity to make us one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this life with its law, God is our God, and we are His people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way for God to be our God is His divine life, and the way for us to be His people is also the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, in the divine life and by the working of the law of the divine life, God will be wrought into us, and we will live Him and be constituted with Him in His life and nature but not, of course, in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we can see what God wants from us, what we are in our fallen condition, and what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants us to take Him as our source and to drink of Him every day so that He may become the river of the water of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our fallen condition we are hopeless, utterly corrupt, incurable, and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Christ has come to be our righteousness and our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outwardly, He is our righteousness for us to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Inwardly, He is the divine life to fill us, to make us one with God, and even to constitute us with God that we may live God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will be a corporate Body, the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the kernel of the book of Jeremiah.</S>
