   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is not only our Judge because of His righteousness, but He is also our Savior-God because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God judged man according to His righteousness after man sinned in the garden of Eden; yet because He loved man, He also promised to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. MAN S BIRTHRIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TO CONTAIN GOD AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man was made by God to contain Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is man s birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A birthright means something that is rightfully yours by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The birthright of a young prince is the kingship, that is, to become the king to rule and to enjoy all the privileges of being king.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the prince were kidnapped and taken away to another land, he would lose his birthright, even though he is still the son of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When man was deceived by Satan to disobey God and to take in the satanic life and nature, he was kidnapped away from God s purpose and lost his birthright to contain God as life.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God promised to rescue man from Satan s control.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He also promised to give His life to man to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis 3:15, God promised that the seed of woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 22:18, God promised that in the seed of Abraham all the nations would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SAVIOR PROPHESIED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to these promises God prophesied in the Old Testament concerning this coming One who is just God Himself coming in the flesh to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, the Old Testament prophesies concerning His birth; that is, of whom He would be born Isa 7:14 and where Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Next, it tells us how He would look Isa 52:14; 53:2 and how He would minister Isa 61:1; 42:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, it foretells the year, the month, the day, the place and the way in which He would die Dan 9:24-26; Exo 12:1-6; Gen 22:2; Deut 21:23; Zech 12:10; Psa 34:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It tells in a picture that He would enter into death and the tomb and resurrect on the third day Jonah 1:2,17; 3:2-10; Matt 12:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ came, He fulfilled all these promises and prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The subject of the entire Old Testament is just this wonderful One, this One promised and prophesied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE GOD-MAN SAVIOR A. Incarnated</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 1:1 says that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Word who became flesh is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is truly God and truly man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He came, He fulfilled all of the promises and prophecies of God in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the God-man, He was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, and lived for thirty-three and a half years as a genuine human being, yet without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then He was crucified in the year, month, day and place which were prophesied hundreds of years earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. Crucified</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The death of Christ has accomplished many wonderful things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are redeemed, forgiven, washed, justified and reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Redeemed means a price has been paid to buy us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Justified means God considers us to be as righteous as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Reconciled means that we, who were God s enemies, have now made up with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On top of all that, His death also bruised Satan s head, as God had promised to do in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>See Heb 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>C. Resurrected</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the third day, He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to give life to man, thus fulfilling the promise in Genesis 22:18.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>See Gal 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He became the promised Spirit to give man life as the eternal blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man s negative problem was solved and his birthright was restored by the death of this Man, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All of man s problems with sins before God were solved, and the head of Satan, the serpent who had kidnapped man, was crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now, man can believe in this Jesus to be saved from sin and death, and to receive the life of God to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have been restored back to God and can now enjoy our birthright, which is to contain God s life.</S>
