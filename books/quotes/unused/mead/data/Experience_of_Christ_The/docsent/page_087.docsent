   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFORMED TO CHRIST'S DEATH FOR THE RELEASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND IMPARTATION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A stanza of a hymn in our hymnal says:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we see the ripened harvest</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of the golden countryside,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may know that many seeds have</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fallen to the earth and died.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before there can be a harvest, many grains need to fall into the earth and die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But who is willing to die?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead of dying, nearly everyone wants to receive glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, no life is imparted into others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easy to have a crowd, but difficult to impart life into others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To do this, we need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is my burden in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Lord's recovery we do not need a crowd; we need the death that releases life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to experience this aspect of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be conformed to Christ's death is the real and practical experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To experience Christ to the uttermost is to die and be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the conformity to Christ's death, we experience Christ in the release of His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not be content with mere outward increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must care for how much life the new ones receive through our impartation, for how much life is infused into others through us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This infusion of life depends not on our ability, strength, or teaching; it depends on our being conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be conformed to His death so that the divine life within us may be released and imparted into others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Time will tell how much life we have imparted into others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may be able to stir up people or excite them, but what counts is how much life is in them after a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life lasts; it is enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that does not last is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, it is merely something of emotion or excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I repeat, the Lord Jesus was not happy to have a large crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He preferred to fall into the ground and die so that life could be imparted into others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had a baptism to undergo, and He was compressed until it was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "I am compressed, limited, confined.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The divine life in Me is eternal and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet, it is confined in the shell of My humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I need to pass through baptism to break the shell of My humanity so that the divine life within Me can be released."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apart from being conformed to Christ's death, there is no way to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In today's Christianity there are many big revivals, and thousands, even millions, of people claim to have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But where is the power of today's so-called church?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is so little power because there is so little life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is difficult to tell a Christian from someone who is not a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not repeat the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only way for us not to be a part of Christianity is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to pray, "Lord, grant me the grace to be willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, I want to follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You said that wherever You are, there will Your servants be.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lord, since You are in death, we must be in death also."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What a need there is for the release of the divine life from within us!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this, we all need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have a baptism to be baptized with, and I am compressed until it is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I need to be released by death, by falling into the ground and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah, Christ died!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through death, the one grain has become the many grains.</S>
