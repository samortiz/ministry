   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament there are three verses that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are important verses that you should memorize.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 3:6 we read: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse speaks of two distinct "spirits": one is capitalized and the other is not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first occurrence of the word refers to the Holy Spirit of God, and the second to the human spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That which is born of the Holy Spirit is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another verse showing these two "spirits" is John 4:24: "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Again, the first "Spirit" is capitalized and the second is not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must worship God, who is the Spirit, in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8:16 further confirms the existence of two spirits: "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The pronoun "our" definitely designates the human spirit and removes any ground to doubt the reality of both the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many who have been Christians for years have never seen the two spirits in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet, this is a crucial truth concerning God, His purpose, and our Christian experience.</S>
