   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Opening the Door 5:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4 says, "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the bowels to be moved means that her deepest feelings are touched.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Her questions are not a rejection, but an indication of the weakness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her will has fully been subjected to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The expression of delay is caused by her natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Inwardly, she has no problem at all, but she is somewhat feeble outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Lord encourages her with new invitations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If her heart were indeed hardened, the Lord would not have pursued her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, He "put in his hand by the hole of the door."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a calling, not a chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This hand is the hand that once embraced her, the hand that was once under her head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This hand is the nail-pierced hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord beckons her once again with such a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Putting the hand through the hole of the door means that the Lord is doing all that He can to reveal a part of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the revelation of His hand, the Lord hopes that she will begin to think about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His hand represents His heart, and it reveals Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All spiritual experiences are the result of the attraction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Men must see the Lord's revelation before they will rise above their present condition of ease to advance further with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who truly see the Lord cannot fail to be moved in their bowels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But how few are those who are moved by the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How many are there who can tell the difference between being touched by the teaching and being touched by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The maiden rises to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of the Lord's attraction, she is willing to accept the cross of shame, just as she was once willing to accept the cross of power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hands that open the door, the hands that signify faith and obedience, surely drop with myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see not only the power of the Lord's death, but the smell of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's life, which has passed through death, is in her hands and it is rising up as a tide, enabling her hands to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the lock of her will cannot help but be permeated with the smell of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>D. Withdrawal 5:6</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 6 says, "I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person who is experienced in the Lord's dealing does not experience discipline from God when he is disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's discipline comes to him only after he is obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a person is obedient, the Lord will show him the evil of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With a beginner, the discipline comes before obedience, and discipline brings him into obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With an experienced person, discipline comes after obedience and gives the person the taste of the bitterness of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the maiden's feeling, her beloved is gone once again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, she lost the Lord's presence because of her foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the pain she experiences is in her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Her spirit seems to be bound in darkness, and there is no light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She recalls how she was beside herself when the Lord first called, and how her soul was raptured away to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He spoke, her heart was ravished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now she hates herself and does not know why she cannot have the outward strength to match her inward desires.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She hates the fact that she gave a false excuse which caused Him to hide His glorious face.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She can only look and call; she cannot find Him, and He will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This search is different from the one she had before.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This search is not on the streets or in the broad places, but before God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even prayer seems to be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>E. Wounded 5:7</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 7 says, "The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This time she does not go out to look for the watchmen, and she does not ask them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, they meet her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They wonder how a person as beautiful as she, who has gone through as much change as she, would lose her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They may try to help her, but their words only serve to hurt her more and increase her pain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She yearns for consolation, but she receives only wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis quoted a good verse regarding this portion: "For they persecute him whom You have stricken,/And they recount the pain of those whom You have wounded" Psa 69:26 . They do not know how to take care of her problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They think that she must be wrong if the Lord has withdrawn.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They do not realize that she has suffered enough blows already; they think that their rebukes can help her.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They give her more blows through their words.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this time, she cannot help but proclaim, "Reproach has broken my heart, /And I am sick;/I looked for pity, but there was none; /And for comforters, but I found none" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Her pain does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only are the others not able to help her or comfort her; they joke about her condition.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who are responsible to keep watch over her do not cover her; rather, they publicize her affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result, she loses her veil, and she is without any covering; her shame is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Her failure becomes public news among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She is indeed like Job, who tried to find a friend who would help him, but ended up with those who condemned him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These keepers are the ones who take responsibility in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Spiritually speaking, they ought to be her guides.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But often even the discernment of a spiritual person can be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our brothers' attitudes toward us may be wrong many times, but this is something under the Lord's permission; the purpose of it is for us to become conscious of our own failures.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we go on with the Lord according to His will, He will have a way to deal with our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we fail, however small this failure may be, the Lord will allow our brothers to deal with us more severely than He Himself will deal with us.</S>
