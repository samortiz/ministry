   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING CHRIST IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our married life we may try to imitate Christ, or we may exercise ourselves to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians have been taught to follow Christ's steps in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, a pastor may advise a married couple, saying, "Christ never quarreled with others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now you should follow His example and not quarrel with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are tempted to quarrel, you must remember to follow Christ and live as He lived."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a brother takes this advice and determines to follow Christ in his married life and never quarrel with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, one day his wife begins to bother him, and the Devil tempts him to argue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He resists for a while, but eventually he loses his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This, of course, is a failure in following Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of failure is very common among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A few strong-willed persons, however, are able to gain the victory over the temptation to quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter how much they are provoked, they do not lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have determined to imitate Christ, following Him not to quarrel, and by their strong will they succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is this the genuine experience of Christ in His experiences?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is merely the practice of a religious teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was born into Christianity, and from my youth I was taught from the Bible to take Christ as my pattern and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later I learned the classical teachings of Confucius, which are very similar to the Christian teachings I had learned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was bothered and began to wonder why we in China needed the foreign religion of Christianity to teach us the same things we had learned from Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because I was troubled about this, for a period of time I set Christianity aside.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the age of nineteen, I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, I still had a problem concerning the similarity of the ethical teachings of Confucius and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Confucius gave us certain good patterns to follow, and Christianity taught us to follow Christ as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I could not answer this question until I received help through the so-called inner life teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I saw that there is a great difference between following ethical teachings and living Christ, and I began to see the vision of Christ living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, in the four Gospels the Lord Jesus did say, "Follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word, however, cannot be found in the Acts and in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of exhorting us to follow Christ in an outward way, the Epistles speak about being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul says, "I know a man in Christ" 2 Cor 12:2 and expresses the desire to be found in Christ Phil 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says that he has been crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives but now Christ lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Philippians 1:21 he tells us that for him to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a great difference there is between trying to imitate Christ outwardly and being in Christ, living Christ, and having Christ live in us!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our married life, we need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a brother is tempted to quarrel with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If at such a time he considers how to follow Christ, he will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the temptation to quarrel comes, the brother should already be living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He should be a person living Christ in his married life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If while living Christ he is tempted to quarrel with his wife, he will not quarrel with her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because he is living Christ, he is living a life that never quarrels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is altogether different from a strong-willed person making up his mind not to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of making up our mind not to quarrel with our spouse, we should live Christ, a life that is not ourselves, a life that never quarrels.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am concerned that when some saints, especially the new ones, hear about experiencing Christ in His experiences, they may try to follow Christ merely in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we try to imitate Christ, we shall be like monkeys trying to imitate human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not try to follow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we need to be enlightened to see that in ourselves we are a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are "monkeys."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can we imitate a man?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should forget about imitating Christ and see that we have One within us who is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This One is our Savior, the very Triune God, living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is not only our life He is even our person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our testimony should be that we do not know what it is to do good or evil; we only know to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We love Him and we fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Early in the morning, the first thing we do is call on Him dearly and lovingly, saying, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we begin to talk to Him, to fellowship with Him, and to take Him in. To take Christ in is to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we shall enjoy Him, live Him, and be what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are such persons, we will not yield to the temptation to quarrel with our husband or wife no matter how much we are tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are now living another life, a life that can defeat the Devil and all the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This life is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Living this kind of life, a life that lives Christ, has nothing to do with religion, and it is absolutely different from the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>My burden in these messages is not to teach doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the contrary, my burden is to minister Christ to you, to share with you my enjoyment, which is one unique person, Jesus Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a wonderful fact that we have such a person living within us, and we can live Him and take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a help to the new ones and the young ones, I would like to share an experience I had when I was a young Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Shortly after I was saved, my sister, who was a student at a theological school, tried to help me in my living as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day she told me about a certain Bible teacher who was very patient and who always walked slowly with Bible in hand, stopping on occasion to gaze into the heavens or to look at the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I heard about him, I decided that I too would be patient and walk slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, I was a "monkey" trying to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am a quick person and in myself I cannot live a slow, patient life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually, I learned some of the inner life teachings, and I was enlightened to see that I had been crucified and buried with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I saw that it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of imitating Christ, we should live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to live Christ, we need to call on Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the way to live a victorious life, which is actually the overcoming Christ as our life.</S>
