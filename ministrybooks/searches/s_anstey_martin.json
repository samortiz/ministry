      "snippet": " We are now approaching the end of the six thousand years. According to the \u201ccreation calendar,\u201d by September 18 this year the Jews will have reached the 5,686th year of their calendar, only 314 years short of six thousand years. This is only a little over three centuries. Mr. Martin Anstey of the former London Missionary Society once did an even more accurate and scriptural calculation. If we consider his calculation, we will become more clear. He reckoned that from the year Adam was created, which was roughly the beginning of the \u201ccreation calendar,\u201d until today, there are 5,967 and one-third years, being thirty-two and two-thirds years short of six thousand years. This is only a little over thirty years from the end. "
