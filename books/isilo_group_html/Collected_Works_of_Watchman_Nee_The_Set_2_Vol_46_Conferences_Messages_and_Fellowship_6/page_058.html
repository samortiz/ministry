The special question in view is worship in relationship to man's creation and man's salvation. Just being a good Christian is too small. John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness." God is Spirit; therefore, we must use our spirit to worship Him. If we do not use our spirit, we cannot worship Him. The creation of man is unlike the rest of creation. Man's constitution has a part that is like God's constitution. If man has a question about his spirit, he will also have a question about worship. First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." If we pour water into water, the result is water. But water with oil does not mix. We are joined to the Lord because our spirit can be mingled with His Spirit. When we are joined to Him, we do not become one body but one spirit. Flesh and blood and will and feelings are useless to God; only our spirit can touch God the Spirit. When God created man, He put a spirit within him. This is the only part of man which is like God. Man has an element in him which is like an element in God. He is Spirit, and a little part of us is spirit. This little part in us can touch God; it can touch eternity.</p><p>The lower forms of created life have feelings; they can choose, but they cannot worship, because they have no spirit. Although man is very small, he is very precious. He is a special creation. If man wants to use his spirit to worship God, he must live in the spirit. He must maintain his fellowship with God, his communication with God. Man's fall not only resulted in wrong acts; it affected man's whole constitution. In the fall we see the record of human behavior and the change in the human constitution. Man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and as a result, his will changed, his feelings changed, and his thoughts changed. Then he was able to understand the difference between good and evil. Through their sin, Adam and Eve changed the constitution God had created in them. Before the fall man had a spirit and could touch God. After the fall his spirit died. Sin affected his constitution. Man became different. Biologically, he was changed. He added his own feelings to his power of decision. If Satan wants worship, he needs something in man that will worship him. Through his soul, man can worship Satan. Satan did not keep his original position. He said, "I will be like the Most High" (Isa. 14:14). When he deceives man, he induces him to abide by his soul, not his spirit. It takes the life of God to enliven and nourish the spirit. Satan originally had a spirit. After he sinned, his spirit was cut off from fellowship with God. Satan now lives by his "I." As such, he works through the self, the "I" of man. We must see the difference between the spirit and the soul. The soul is now a faculty that can decide for itself. Man can be independent of God. In this way Satan receives worship.</p><p>This is the meaning of the story in Eden. Before the fall man had to trust in God for everything. After the fall it was no longer necessary for man to trust in God; he could decide for himself. Man was never created with such power, but through the fall his constitution was changed.</p><p>The spirit is forever tied to dependence; whereas the soul is forever tied to independence. The man God created was of no use to Satan; he had to have an independent and proud man for his purpose. When man lives by his soul, he has an arrogant attitude, and Satan gains his worship. Every means is used today to enlarge man's soul through education, knowledge, etc. This generation of men is very independent and stubborn. God wants people who are dependent upon Him. Satan wants men who can do everything by themselves. So we must learn how to live by the spirit and ask the Lord to deliver us from the power of the soul. If one is spiritual, there will be humility; if he is soulish, he will be proud.</p><p>What is salvation? Salvation not only deals with our sins, but also restores our constitution. Man is wrong both inwardly and outwardly. This is why he needs both the outward restitution as well as the inward restoration. "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." This is regeneration in our constitution. When a man is saved, he is cleansed outwardly as well as changed constitutionally.</p><p>The soul cannot understand God; only the Spirit can. We must learn to lose our soul. It is a daily work to lose our soul. God does not deal with our soul in the same way that he dealt with our sins in his substitutionary work. We must lose our own souls, and we must bear our cross daily. What does this mean? It means to come to God and not make any judgment by ourselves.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:27-28 says that God has chosen the foolish, weak, and the lowborn. This is because they are those whose souls are not enlarged. If we live according to the spirit, God will gain our worship. But if we live according to the soul, Satan will gain our worship.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 46: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (6) &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
