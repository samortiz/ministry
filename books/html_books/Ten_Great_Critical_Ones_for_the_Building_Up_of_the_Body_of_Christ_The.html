Lord, we believe there is a will in You for this gathering. Carry out this will among us. Speak something to us that will impress us for eternity. Lord, give us the understanding, give us the revelation, and give us the speaking. Lord, speak with us. We believe that You are one spirit with us in this meeting. Anoint all the brothers from all the countries. Lord, it is a lovely time that we can come together to have such a fellowship. Lord, help me in the speaking. You know that I am fearful and trembling before You that I may delay You. Lord, save me from this. Whatever You want to speak to us, speak it. Speak it freely. Glory be to You, shame to Your enemy, and blessing to all Your Body. Amen.<p>I have been considering very much what the Lord would speak to us for this time. I do not want to speak anything that is not from Him. Eventually, the Lord reminded me of ten great, critical points in His revelation concerning our belief in Him for His recovery. I call them the ten &#8220;ones.&#8221; Each critical point is a &#8220;one.&#8221; These first five &#8220;ones&#8221; are the one Bible, one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one life. These five big &#8220;ones&#8221; are the factors. Then there are another five &#8220;ones&#8221;: the one salvation, one living, one testimony, one Body, and one city, which is the one consummation. These five are the issues which are produced from the preceding five factors. Each great &#8220;one&#8221; actually needs two conferences so that it can be covered adequately.<p>This is a golden opportunity for me to present to you these ten great &#8220;ones.&#8221; All of you are either co-workers or elders in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. In this sense, you are important persons. What the Lord&#8217;s recovery will be depends upon you co-workers and elders. Thus, I consider what I am releasing here to be very critical. I want to give you the proper knowledge of the ten great &#8220;ones&#8221; at this juncture. Then you will know who we are, where we are, and where we should go. &#8220;We&#8221; means the recovery. Although we need twenty conferences to speak all these points covered by these six messages, I am taking the opportunity to present an abstract of these points. We have to take these ten great &#8220;ones&#8221; back to our places to have conference after conference. First, we must get ourselves into them and then help all the saints realize what the Lord&#8217;s recovery really is.<h2 class=head1>I. ONE BIBLE-ONE REVELATION</h2><p>Upon this earth, everyone knows there is one Bible, but this one Bible is in the hands of different people. What kind of Bible people have depends upon what kind of people they are. The Jews have their Bible. Their Bible is just the first part of the whole Bible, so they have a Bible which is incomplete. The orthodox Jews do not believe in the New Testament. They believe that their Bible, the Old Testament, is the pure, holy Word of God and that nothing should be added to it. Of course, they are mistaken in what they believe.<p>Then the Christians have their Bible, the entire Bible, but there are many divisions today among the Christians. The Brethren were raised up in the middle part of the last century and they were one, but today there are over one thousand divisions among them. Nearly every division of the Brethren has &#8220;their own Bible.&#8221; This means that they have the same Bible with different interpretations, which have divided them. Furthermore, the closed Brethren use the New Translation by John Nelson Darby. The open Brethren use the Newberry Bible with its marginal notes. The Catholics also have their Bible, which has more than sixty-six books because they have added something.<p>Today I would ask, &#8220;What kind of Bible do we have?&#8221; The Bible we have determines what kind of persons we are. All the divisions among the Christians came out of different interpretations of the Bible. We should not have more than one Bible in the recovery. To have a proper Bible, which is really according to God&#8217;s revelation, depends upon the way we understand it. If we understand the Bible properly, we will have a proper Bible. The Bible itself is never wrong, but with us it can be wrong.<p>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul said, &#8220;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.&#8221; We have to cut the word straightly as in carpentry. We have to interpret the written Word of God as a carpenter cutting wood. This means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. Second Timothy 2:15 is very meaningful and should control us to the uttermost. There are different ways of understanding the same Bible. When the apostle Paul was on earth, he was contending with the unbelieving Jews and correcting them by cutting the word rightly, straightly. Now we need to see how to cut the word in a straight way.<h2 class=head2>A. The Unique Bible Being Consistent in Its Unique Revelation</h2><p>The Bible is consistent in its unique revelation. The Baptists stress baptism by their kind of immersion, whereas the Presbyterians and others practice sprinkling. But the practice of baptism is not the Bible&#8217;s unique revelation.<h2 class=head3>1. Not Interpreted according to Man&#8217;s Own Concepts</h2><p>The Bible should not be interpreted according to man&#8217;s own concepts-understandings, logic, philosophies, views, and fanciful imaginations. These concepts should be altogether abandoned. Peter indicates that we do not have the freedom to interpret the prophecy of the Bible by our natural concept, because it is revealed by God (2 Pet. 1:20-21). We have to pray for God to help us know His original meaning in speaking such a prophecy.<h2 class=head3>2. Any Interpretation of the Unique Bible Being Governed by the Principles of Its Interpretation</h2><p>Any interpretation of the unique Bible should be governed by the principles of its interpretation.<h2 class=head4>a. Interpreted Only by and according to Itself</h2><p>First, the unique Bible should be interpreted only by and according to itself. The Bible interprets the Bible. When some of the students of Confucius in China became Christians, they understood the Bible according to the teachings of Confucius. This, of course, is wrong. The Bible must be interpreted by itself and according to itself.<h2 class=head4>b. Interpreted by Discerning the Differences in the Dispensational Progress of the Divine Revelation</h2><p>The Bible should also be interpreted by discerning the differences in the dispensational progress of the divine revelation. This is a big principle. The dispensations in the Bible are important. There are the Old Testament dispensation and the New Testament dispensation. In the Old Testament dispensation the seventh day was ordained by God as the Sabbath, but in the New Testament, the Sabbath was put aside and is over. The Seventh-Day Adventists did not discern this dispensational difference, so they insist on keeping the Sabbath. They charge the New Testament saints to keep something in the Old Testament, and their way to keep the Sabbath is also according to the Old Testament way.<p>We have to see the dispensational progress in the divine revelation. Abraham&#8217;s time was different from Noah&#8217;s time. At Noah&#8217;s time God did not tell His chosen people where to go and where to stay. But God told Abraham to leave his idolatrous country and go to the good land. He also told him to circumcise all of his young males. Such things were not revealed to Noah. The time of Moses was the age, the dispensation, of the law. Then when the Lord Jesus came, that was a big change of dispensation. His coming ushered in the age of grace.<p>Today the Catholic Church mixes up the Old and New Testament dispensations. The Catholic leaders wear robes which are according to the robes of the priests in the Old Testament. The Pentecostals in their practice and concept stay mostly in the Old Testament dispensation. The verses they sing are mostly from the Old Testament. It is rare to hear them sing or give a message from the book of Ephesians, because this book is different from the Pentecostal kind of understanding. Ephesians is deep, but the Pentecostal understanding concerning speaking in tongues and miraculous things is superficial and outward.<p>In our interpretation of the Bible, we must learn one principle-to know the dispensations in God&#8217;s revelation. This is because God&#8217;s revelation is progressive from one stage to another stage, from one dispensation to another dispensation.<h2 class=head4>c. Any Interpretation of the Unique Bible Should Take Care of Its Minor Revelations but Should Not Have Any Minor Revelations Interpreted against the Major Revelation of This Unique and Consistent Bible</h2><p>The main revelation is the center of the Bible. Besides the main revelation, the central revelation, there are minor revelations. They are branches of the major revelation. A tree has a trunk with branches. The trunk is one, but the branches are many. We should stress the trunk, the central revelation of the Bible, but we should not forget the &#8220;branch&#8221; revelations, the minor revelations.<p>Also, any interpretation of the unique Bible should not have any minor revelations interpreted against, not in line or in harmony with, the major revelation of this unique and consistent Bible. First Corinthians 11 speaks of a revelation concerning the headship in which all the sisters should cover their head, but head covering is not the Bible&#8217;s central revelation. We should not neglect this branch revelation, but we should not be legalistic about it either. Some people argue about what color or what shape of head covering the sisters should wear. These arguments are nonsense. Head covering reminds us that we all have to be under the headship of our Head, as Christ is under the headship of God the Father. We must have the reality of the branch revelations.<h2 class=head2>B. The Unique, Major Revelation of the Unique Bible</h2><p>The unique, major revelation of the unique Bible is the unique contents of God&#8217;s economy (see point II. D.). The Bible has been studied by Christians for nearly two thousand years with many interpretations. It is hard to decide which interpretations are correct. Brother Watchman Nee spent much time to study and collect all the proper, major interpretations of the Bible. Thank the Lord that when I was laboring closely with him for eighteen years, he told me what he had collected. Thus, today our interpretation of the Bible is according to the proper interpretations throughout the past nineteen centuries.<p>The Recovery Version actually is not my version because my understanding of the Bible depends absolutely on Watchman Nee&#8217;s interpretation. Furthermore, Brother Nee&#8217;s interpretation depended upon the proper interpretations of all the saints in the past nineteen centuries. This does not mean that Brother Nee or I did not see anything by ourselves but that we have laid our understanding upon the proper foundation.<h2 class=head1>II. ONE GOD-ONE ECONOMY</h2><p>God is self-existing and ever-existing (Exo. 3:14), and God is triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). The Triune God has one heart&#8217;s desire (Eph. 1:5, 9). According to His heart&#8217;s desire, God made His eternal economy (1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 1:10; 3:9) to make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in His Godhead and to make Himself one with man and man one with Him, thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression, that all His divine attributes may be expressed in human virtues.<p>God carries out His eternal economy through a number of steps. First, He created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). Then God became a man in His image and after His likeness. He became a man in His incarnation to partake of the human nature (Heb. 2:14a). He lived a human life to express His attributes through man&#8217;s virtues. He died an all-inclusive death and resurrected to produce the firstborn Son of God and become the life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:29; Acts 13:33; 1 Cor. 15:45). This was all for Him to dispense Himself into His chosen people to regenerate them with Himself as their life for producing many sons-many God-men (1 Pet. 1:3)-for the forming of the churches with His many sons and for the building up of the Body of Christ with His brothers as the members to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, consummating in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression.<p>We may say that we have already heard the truth concerning God&#8217;s economy, but to hear is not sufficient. We have to present this truth to others, to give messages to them. Paul exhorted Timothy to stay in Ephesus to charge some there not to speak things other than God&#8217;s economy (1 Tim. 1:3-4). We have to be controlled by the vision of God&#8217;s economy. We should not speak anything other than God&#8217;s economy.<h1 class=series>THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL &#8220;ONES&#8221; FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>ONE CHRIST-THE UNSEARCHABLE ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Christ is the eternal and only begotten Son of God, the Second of the Divine Trinity-John 1:1-2, 18; Matt. 28:19.</li><li>He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Spirit in eternity.</li><li>He is, with the Father and the Spirit, the only God-John 1:1; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8.</li><li>He is the Creator (Heb. 1:10), and all things were created through Him (John 1:3; Col. 1:16a), cohere in Him (Col. 1:17), and will be an inheritance unto Him as the Heir (Col. 1:16b; Heb. 1:2; Rom. 11:34-36).</li><li>In time He became a man through His incarnation, a God-man having both divinity and humanity as His nature-John 1:1, 14; Heb. 2:14.</li><li>He is the Firstborn of all creation-Col. 1:15b.</li><li>He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory and the impress of God&#8217;s substance-Heb. 1:3a.</li><li>He is the embodiment of God-Col. 2:9.</li><li>He is the image of the invisible God-Col. 1:15a.</li><li>He lived in His humanity on the earth to express God for thirty-three and a half years-He is God manifested in the flesh-1 Tim. 3:16.</li><li>He is the faithful Witness of God-Rev. 1:5.</li><li>He is the tabernacle of God as God&#8217;s movable dwelling place among men-John 1:14.</li><li>He is the temple of God as God&#8217;s established dwelling place on earth-John 2:19-21.</li><li>He is the light of the world-John 8:12.</li><li>He died an all-inclusive death through which He crucified Satan-the old serpent (John 3:14; Heb. 2:14)-sin (Rom. 8:3; John 1:29), the world (John 12:31), the fallen man with his flesh (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20), the old creation (represented by the old fallen man), and the law with its ordinances (Rom. 10:4; Col. 2:14; Eph. 2:15) for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12), and released His divine life from the shell of His humanity to be dispensed into His believers (John 12:24; 3:15).</li><li>He resurrected from among the dead (Matt. 28:6-7; 1 Cor. 15:4b), and through His resurrection He in His humanity was designated to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4; 8:29; Acts 13:33), became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and regenerated with His resurrection life all the people chosen by God before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:2-3; Eph. 1:4).</li><li>He ascended to the heavens, and in His ascension He was crowned and enthroned to be:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Lord of all men and all things to rule over the whole universe-Acts 10:36.</li>	<li>Christ-the Anointed of God-to accomplish God&#8217;s economy-Acts 2:36.</li>	<li>The Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5) to arrange the situations of the world and the environment of God&#8217;s chosen people that they may be saved by Him as</li>	<li>The Savior who will be received by all His believers as their everything-Acts 5:31.</li>	<li>The Head of the church to take care of the church as His Body-Eph. 1:22-23; 5:29-30.</li>	<li>The Paraclete in heaven before God to take care of all the cases and needs of His members (1 John 2:1), and the One who is realized by His Spirit as the Paraclete in His members (John 14:16-20).</li>	<li>The heavenly Minister to minister heaven into His believers to make them the heavenly citizens-Heb. 8:2; Phil. 3:20.</li>	<li>The great High Priest in the heavens to take care of His believers&#8217; needs, intercede for them, and save them to the uttermost-Heb. 4:14-15; 7:25-27.</li>	<li>The Mediator of the new covenant, bequeathed by Him to His believers through His death, to execute it-Heb. 8:6; 9:15.</li>	<li>The surety of the better covenant to be its guarantee-Heb. 7:22.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Father, we worship You for Your word. Lord Jesus, we love You because You are the Word of God. We love You, and we thank You for tonight&#8217;s meeting. Strengthen us in the speaking and anoint us in the listening. Grant us a real revelation in every word. Amen.<p>We have covered one Bible-one revelation-and one God-one economy. Now we come to the third &#8220;one,&#8221; one Christ-the unsearchable One. Through the years because of our testimony of the unsearchable riches of Christ, some Christians in the denominations have asked us, &#8220;What kind of Christ do you have? Is your Christ not the same as our Christ?&#8221; Millions of Christians have Christ, but to what extent have they experienced Christ? As we review the following items of Christ we should ask, &#8220;Have I experienced Christ in this item?&#8221; To what extent have we experienced Christ?<p>The apostle Paul experienced the same Christ as millions of Christians, but the extent of his enjoyment of Christ reached the top. Christ in Himself is the same in nature, in essence, and in His being unlimited, unsearchable, and all-inclusive; but in the experiences of His believers, there are many different extents. This should help us all to realize that our Christ is totally all-inclusive. He is the complete God and the perfect man. Even the reality of the food we eat is Christ. He is also the living water. According to the New Testament, Christ is everything to us.<h2 class=head1>THE ETERNAL CHRIST</h2><p>Christ is the eternal and only begotten Son of God, the Second of the Divine Trinity (John 1:1-2, 18; Matt. 28:19). He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Spirit in eternity. He is, with the Father and the Spirit, the only God (John 1:1; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8). In other words, He as the Son with the Father and the Spirit is one God.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN CREATION</h2><p>He is the Creator (Heb. 1:10), and all things were created through Him (John 1:3; Col. 1:16a), cohere in Him (Col. 1:17), and will be an inheritance unto Him as the Heir (Col. 1:16b; Heb. 1:2; Rom. 11:34-36). On the one hand, Christ is the Creator, but on the other hand, He is the means through which all things were created. He is also the very center of creation because all things subsist, cohere, in Him. Eventually, all things will be an inheritance to Him as the Heir.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S INCARNATION</h2><p>In time He became a man through His incarnation, a God-man having both divinity and humanity as His nature (John 1:1, 14; Heb. 2:14). In eternity Christ was merely God, but in time He became a man. He is also the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15b). He is not only God and man but also the first item of the creation. As a man, He is a part of the creation, but how could He be the Firstborn? This is hard to answer. We need to see that with God there is only the fact without the time element. Christ was crucified about two thousand years ago, but the Bible says He was crucified from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). From the time that the earth was founded, He was crucified because the earth needs His crucifixion. We must learn to present this to people.<p>Just as light is the effulgence of electricity, Christ is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory. He is also the impress of God&#8217;s substance (Heb. 1:3a). God is a kind of substance, and Christ is the impress. We may illustrate this with a seal. The seal is a kind of substance. When we put the seal on a paper, we have the impress. Christ is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) and the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15a). God is invisible and untouchable, but one day God embodied Himself in Christ. God became visible and touchable.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S HUMAN LIVING</h2><p>Christ lived in His humanity on the earth to express God for thirty-three and a half years-He is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). He is the faithful Witness of God (Rev. 1:5). He witnessed God.<p>He is also the tabernacle of God as God&#8217;s movable dwelling place among men (John 1:14). Most of the English versions say in John 1:14 that the Word became flesh and dwelt among men. This predicate, according to the Greek text, should be tabernacled. He is God&#8217;s dwelling place among men, but movable, like a tent, a tabernacle. Abraham brought his tent through many places. Christ was such a tent of God among men. Also, He is the temple of God as God&#8217;s established dwelling place on earth (John 2:19-21). Furthermore, Christ is the light of the world (John 8:12).<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S DEATH</h2><p>He died an all-inclusive death through which He crucified Satan-the old serpent (John 3:14; Heb. 2:14)-sin (Rom. 8:3; John 1:29), the world (John 12:31), the fallen man with his flesh (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20), the old creation (represented by the old fallen man), and the law with its ordinances (Rom. 10:4; Col. 2:14; Eph. 2:15) for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). Through His death He also released His divine life from the shell of His humanity to be dispensed into His believers (John 12:24; 3:15). Christ&#8217;s death abolished all the negative things. On the positive side, He released His divine life from His human shell. He was the one grain who died to release His life and become many grains. The negative side of Christ&#8217;s death was for God&#8217;s redemption; the positive side is for life dispensing.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S RESURRECTION</h2><p>He resurrected from among the dead (Matt. 28:6-7; 1 Cor. 15:4b), and through His resurrection He in His humanity was designated to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4; 8:29; Acts 13:33), became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and regenerated with His resurrection life all the people chosen by God before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:2-3; Eph. 1:4). We were regenerated in His resurrection.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST&#8217;S ASCENSION</h2><p>Christ ascended to the heavens, and in His ascension He was crowned and enthroned to be the Lord of all men and all things to rule over the whole universe (Acts 10:36), the Christ-the Anointed of God-to accomplish God&#8217;s economy (Acts 2:36), and the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5) to arrange the situations of the world and the environment of God&#8217;s chosen people that they may be saved by Him as the Savior who will be received by all His believers as their everything (Acts 5:31). Christ rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God&#8217;s chosen people to receive His salvation. He needs to be the Ruler of all situations to save us. A person may live in a remote place where there is no opportunity for him to hear the gospel, so the Lord arranges the situation to bring him to another place where he can hear the gospel and be saved. I hate imperialism, but I thank the Lord that He used imperialism to save me. Without imperialism, the gospel could never have gone to China and to my hometown there.<p>In His ascension Christ is also the Head of the church to take care of the church as His Body (Eph. 1:22-23; 5:29-30), the Paraclete in heaven before God to take care of all the cases and needs of His members (1 John 2:1), and the One who is realized by His Spirit as the Paraclete in His members (John 14:16-20). He is the heavenly Minister to minister heaven into His believers to make them the heavenly citizens (Heb. 8:2; Phil. 3:20), the great High Priest in the heavens to take care of His believers&#8217; needs, intercede for them, and save them to the uttermost (Heb. 4:14-15; 7:25-27), the Mediator of the new covenant, bequeathed by Him to His believers through His death, to execute it (Heb. 8:6; 9:15), and the surety of the better covenant to be its guarantee (Heb. 7:22). The above items are different aspects of Christ&#8217;s ministry in the heavens.<h1 class=series>THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL &#8220;ONES&#8221; FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>ONE CHRIST-THE UNSEARCHABLE ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="18"><li>He is the Shepherd of God&#8217;s flock, the door for them to come out of Judaism, and the pasture for them to feed on-John 10:11, 14, 16, 9.</li><li>He is the resurrection, the life, the way, and the reality-John 11:25; 14:6.</li><li>He is the Bridegroom who has the bride-John 3:29a.</li><li>He is the power of God and the wisdom to His believers from God: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption-1 Cor. 1:24, 30.</li><li>He is the Passover for the believers to pass through God&#8217;s judgment-1 Cor. 5:7.</li><li>He is the spiritual food and the spiritual rock flowing with the living water for God&#8217;s people-1 Cor. 10:3-4; John 6:35; 4:10, 14.</li><li>He is the Body (1 Cor. 12:12) and all the members of the Body-the new man (Col. 3:10-11).</li><li>He is the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam-1 Cor. 15:20, 23, 47, 45.</li><li>He is the Firstborn from the dead to be the Head of the Body-Col. 1:18.</li><li>He is God&#8217;s allotted portion to the saints-Col. 1:12.</li><li>He is the body (the reality) of all the positive things to God&#8217;s people-Col. 2:16-17.</li><li>He is the life of His believers and the One whom they live and magnify-Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:20-21.</li><li>He is the Lamb accomplishing God&#8217;s redemption and the Lion fighting for God&#8217;s kingdom-Rev. 5:5-6.</li><li>He is the opener of the seals of the secrets of this age-Rev. 5:5.</li><li>He is His believers&#8217; hope of glory-Col. 1:27.</li><li>He is the morning star who will appear to His overcomers before His coming back to the earth-Rev. 2:28.</li><li>He is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings to appear to the world-Mal. 4:2.</li><li>His riches dispensed into His saints are unsearchable-Eph. 3:8.</li><li>He is the Savior coming back to:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Transfigure His believers-Phil. 3:21.</li>	<li>Judge His believers to discern who among them should be rewarded with the kingdom and its enjoyment as a reward for one thousand years; and who among them should be disciplined in the kingdom age, thus missing the kingdom as a reward-2 Cor. 5:10.</li>	<li>Marry His overcomers as His bride in the millennial age-Rev. 19:7.</li>	<li>Defeat Antichrist and his armies-Rev. 19:19-21.</li>	<li>Be received by the remnant of the Jews-Zech. 12:10; Rom. 11:26.</li>	<li>Judge the nations-the living people (Acts 10:42)-on His throne of glory-Matt. 25:31.</li>	</ol></li><li>He will be the King to rule over the earth with His overcomers-Rev. 20:4, 6.</li><li>He will judge all the dead people (Acts 10:42) at His great white throne-Rev. 20:11-12.</li><li>In the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-22:5) He will be:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Husband of God&#8217;s redeemed people as His wife in eternity-21:2.</li>	<li>The temple with God-21:22.</li>	<li>The lamp with God as the light in Him-21:23.</li>	<li>The Lamb-God on the throne to rule over the new heaven and new earth-22:1.</li>	<li>The tree of life nourishing the entire New Jerusalem-22:2.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You. You have gathered us again together around You as the Spirit and around Your Word as life. We love You, Lord, as the Spirit, as the Word with life. We desire to see what You are to us. In all these rich items, be with us, strengthen us, and uphold us. Amen.<p>In the previous message, we saw Christ from eternity, through creation, and through His incarnation, His human living, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, and His ascension. In ascension He was appointed to be many items, first as the Lord of all, the Christ, and last as the surety of the new covenant. Now He is both in the heavens and in the church life. In the church age, He takes care of His church as many items.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE CHURCH AGE</h2><p>Christ is the Shepherd of God&#8217;s flock, the door for them to come out of Judaism, and the pasture for them to feed on (John 10:11, 14, 16, 9). He is the resurrection, the life, the way, and the reality (John 11:25; 14:6). He is the Bridegroom who has the bride (John 3:29a).<p>Christ is the power of God and the wisdom to His believers from God: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). He is the Passover for the believers to pass through God&#8217;s judgment (1 Cor. 5:7). He is the spiritual food and the spiritual rock flowing with living water for God&#8217;s people (1 Cor. 10:3-4; John 6:35; 4:10, 14). He is the Body (1 Cor. 12:12) and all the members of the Body-the new man (Col. 3:10-11). As the members of the Body, all of us are Christ. We should declare that we are not only members of Christ but also Christ. Christ is the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:20, 23, 47, 45). He is the first, the second, the last, and every number.<p>He is the Firstborn from the dead to be the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18). He was the Firstborn of all creation, belonging to the old creation of God. Now He is the Firstborn from the dead as the Head of the Body in the new creation. He is God&#8217;s allotted portion to the saints (Col. 1:12), typified by God&#8217;s allotted portion of the good land to the people of Israel. Today He is also the body (the reality) of all the positive things to God&#8217;s people (Col. 2:16-17). He is the real feast, new moon, and Sabbath. He is everything. All the things in the Old Testament were shadows, and He is the body, the reality, of all those shadows. He is the life of His believers and the One whom they live and magnify (Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:20-21).<p>Christ is the Lamb accomplishing God&#8217;s redemption and the Lion fighting for God&#8217;s kingdom (Rev. 5:5-6). For God&#8217;s redemption, He is a Lamb. For God&#8217;s kingdom, He is a fighting Lion, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He is also the opener of the seals of the secrets of this age (Rev. 5:5). This implies the contents of the entire book of Revelation. Christ is also His believers&#8217; hope of glory (Col. 1:27).<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN HIS SECOND COMING</h2><p>At the end of the church age, after He has been so many items to take care of the church, He will be the coming One. First, He will come secretly as the morning star who will appear to His overcomers before His coming back to the earth (Rev. 2:28). In the early morning, before most people awake, the morning star appears. Very few will see Christ as the morning star. He is also the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings to appear to the whole world (Mal. 4:2).<p>His riches dispensed into His saints are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). In the church age He dispenses His riches to the believers, and those riches are unsearchable, untraceable.<p>He is the Savior coming back to transfigure His believers (Phil. 3:21). He will change the form of our body; this transfiguration is called the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). Christ has regenerated our spirit. He is now transforming our soul, conforming our soul to His image. We are also waiting for His coming back to redeem our body, to change our body from the low level to the highest level of His body, a glorious body. Then our whole being will be saved. When I was young, some would ask me, &#8220;Are you saved?&#8221; I did not know how to answer them. Later I realized that I can say, &#8220;I have been saved in my spirit; I am now being saved in my soul; and I will be saved in my body.&#8221; Hallelujah for this threefold salvation of our spirit, our soul, and our body!<p>Peter speaks of the salvation of the soul, that is, the salvation by transformation (1 Pet. 1:9). Our being transformed is the progress of the salvation of our soul. When we are matured, we will be completely saved in our soul. The only way to be transformed in our soul is for us to be crossed out. We have to be conformed to Christ&#8217;s death (Phil. 3:10). When this process is completed, we will be saved in our soul to wait for our body to be saved.<p>Christ will judge His believers to discern who among them should be rewarded with the kingdom and its enjoyment as a reward for one thousand years; and who among them should be disciplined in the kingdom age, thus missing the kingdom as a reward (2 Cor. 5:10).<p>Christ will come back to marry His overcomers as His bride in the millennial age (Rev. 19:7). Today we are engaged, not yet married, to Christ. When He finally saves our body to change our body, we will be ready for our marriage with Him. Revelation 19 says, &#8220;His wife has made herself ready&#8221; (v. 7). Christ still cannot marry us because we are not completely saved. He will not marry a bride with an old body in the old creation, full of sin, death, weakness, and sickness. He cannot marry us until He saves us in our body. At that time we will be completely a new man; we will be a new man in our spirit, a new man in our soul, and a new man in our body.<p>The Lord will also come to defeat Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 19:19-21). First, He comes to transfigure us; second, to marry us; and third, to defeat Antichrist. As the Bridegroom, the One who has just been married, He will defeat Antichrist. Christ, the General, will be the Bridegroom, and His army will be His spouse, His corporate bride, composed of all the overcomers. We should tell the Lord, &#8220;I want to be an overcomer, Lord. I will then be a part of the bride, as one of Your overcomers, to overcome Antichrist with You.&#8221;<p>When Christ returns, He will be received by the remnant of the Jews (Zech. 12:10; Rom. 11:26). Antichrist will surround the city of Jerusalem, fighting against the Jews to put them all to death. At that time, the Messiah will appear. On the one hand, the Messiah will defeat the enemy; on the other hand, the remnant of the Jews will see Him, the One whom they pierced, and they will repent. Christ will be received by them. Today the Jewish nation is unbelieving. They do not receive Christ. They do not believe there has been such a Christ as we preach, as the New Testament reveals.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST JUDGING THE LIVING BEFORE THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>Most of the nations will follow Antichrist in his rebellion, and most of them will be killed in the battle of Armageddon. Revelation 14:20 says that the blood from this battle will be &#8220;up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia.&#8221; A thousand six hundred stadia is 182 miles, the distance from Bozrah (Isa. 63:1) to Armageddon (Rev. 16:16). One day Christ, the embodiment of God, will fight face to face with the Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan. Nearly the whole world will follow Antichrist to fight against Christ.<p>While Antichrist is seducing the world to follow him against the Jews and against the remnant of the Christians, the eternal gospel will be preached by an angel who will shout, &#8220;Fear God...and worship Him&#8221; (Rev. 14:7). Some from the nations will respond to this gospel and will take care of the Jews and the believers who are under the persecution of Antichrist. Christ will gather all of those from the nations who remain after the battle of Armageddon to His throne of glory in Jerusalem where He will judge them to divide them into sheep, the good ones, and goats, the bad ones. The sheep will be those who respond to the eternal gospel. The Lord Jesus will cast the goats, those who followed Antichrist, into the lake of fire with Antichrist, whereas the sheep will enter into His kingdom, not as His sons but as His subjects to live in the sphere of eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46).<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>Christ will be the King to rule over the earth with His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6) in the kingdom of one thousand years. He will be the King to the people and the Priest to God. All His overcomers who joined Him in the wedding and in the fighting will also join Him in the kingship with the priesthood for one thousand years to serve God and rule over all the nations, the sheep.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST JUDGING THE DEAD AFTER THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>Christ will judge all the dead people (Acts 10:42) at His great white throne (Rev. 20:11-12). The Bible says that Christ has been appointed by God to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1; Rom. 2:16). He will judge the living, the sheep and the goats, at His throne of glory at the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom. After the thousand-year kingdom, He will be on the white throne to judge all the dead and sentence them to the lake of fire.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-22:5) He will be the Husband of God&#8217;s redeemed people as His wife in eternity (21:2) and the temple with God for the redeemed to live in as their eternal dwelling place to serve God (21:22). He will also be the lamp with God as the light in Him (21:23) to shine through the lamp and through the New Jerusalem. He will be the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, on the throne to rule over the new heaven and new earth (22:1). The throne is one for both God and the Lamb because God as the light is within the Lamb as the lamp. God is in the Lamb, and the Lamb is sitting on the throne. Eventually, in eternity He will be the tree of life nourishing the entire New Jerusalem (22:2).<p>We need to see the sequence of the items of Christ in these last two messages. We have seen Christ in eternity, in creation, in incarnation, in His human living, in His all-inclusive death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension. Once the church is established, He is many items to take care of the church and to transform us. After our transformation is completed, He will come back to redeem us. Then He will be in the kingdom, and after the kingdom He will be in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the ultimate item is the tree of life. This is the all-inclusive, unsearchable, extensive, unlimited Christ, who is our Christ. This is the Christ whom the recovery receives.<p>We must have the recovery mainly to recover Christ. Christ in His all-inclusiveness has been mostly lost in the denominational theology. All the denominations have their creed, including the Nicene Creed. None of them is as complete as these two messages on Christ. We have to spread the recovery&#8217;s creed concerning the all-inclusive Christ from eternity past to eternity future.<p>We should humble ourselves before the Lord by saying, &#8220;Lord, we have been in Your recovery for many years hearing that Christ is the centrality and universality of God&#8217;s economy, but we have never learned to know Him so much.&#8221; If we share these aspects of Christ with others, we will see a difference in our gospel preaching. This will convince people. To be vital we need to know these aspects of Christ. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is the recovery of Christ.<h1 class=series>THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL &#8220;ONES&#8221; FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>ONE SPIRIT-ONE APPLICATION</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity-Gen. 1:2;

We love You particularly as the Spirit. Pour out the Spirit upon us. Lead us and anoint each one of us. Amen.<p>We have covered one Bible, one God, and one Christ. Now we want to see one Spirit-one application.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING THE THIRD OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><p>The first point concerning the Spirit is that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity (Gen. 1:2; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 2:11; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Son in eternity. He is, with the Father and the Son, the only God (Acts 5:3-4). Acts 5 tells us He is God, but He is not another God other than the Triune God. He is of the Triune God, with the Father and the Son.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING NOT YET BEFORE THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2><p>He was the Spirit of God from eternity and the Holy Spirit at the time of Christ&#8217;s incarnation (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20), but He was not &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; before the resurrection of Christ (John 7:39).<h2 class=head1>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</h2><p>In Christ&#8217;s resurrection He was compounded with Christ&#8217;s divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the life-giving Spirit, the divine anointing ointment as the compound Spirit (Exo. 30:22-31; 1 Cor. 15:45). All genuine Christians admit that in Christ there is humanity, because He became a man and partook of the flesh and blood of man (Heb. 2:14). But some may wonder how we can say that the Spirit of God has humanity. Chapter five of Andrew Murray&#8217;s masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, is entitled &#8220;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.&#8221; The glorified Jesus is Jesus after His resurrection in His glory. In this chapter Andrew Murray strongly pointed out and insisted that today the Spirit of the glorified Jesus has the element of humanity just as the glorified Jesus does. The glorified Jesus has divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection. Surely the Spirit of this Jesus has the same elements as the glorified Jesus. The striking point of Andrew Murray&#8217;s theology is that the Spirit of Jesus has humanity.<p>Based upon this revelation, I began to understand the type of the anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. In Exodus this ointment was used to anoint all the furniture and people related to God&#8217;s service. Some of the Brethren pointed out that the anointing ointment was a type of the Spirit, but no one pointed out that this is the compound Spirit. An ointment is a compound. The ointment in Exodus 30 is compounded with olive oil as the base and four kinds of spices. Olive oil in the Old Testament is a type of God&#8217;s Spirit. In Exodus 30 the olive oil, typifying God&#8217;s Spirit, was compounded with four more elements. These elements typify Christ&#8217;s death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power which are in the life-giving Spirit.<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam, who was Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. Some who oppose this truth have said that this life-giving Spirit does not refer to the Holy Spirit. But besides the Holy Spirit, there is not another Spirit who gives life. The Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6), the life-giving Spirit, is the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ESSENCE AND GOD&#8217;S REACHING OF MAN</h2><p>The Spirit is also God&#8217;s essence (John 4:24) and God&#8217;s reaching of man (Matt. 28:19). Christ is the element of the Triune God, and the Spirit is the essence. He is God&#8217;s reaching of man because He is the last one of the three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. John 4:24 says that if we are going to worship God, we must worship Him as the Spirit by our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE REALIZATION OF THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST AND THE REALITY OF CHRIST&#8217;S RESURRECTION</h2><p>The Spirit is the realization of the pneumatic Christ (John 14:16-20) and the reality of the resurrection of Christ. The pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the Spirit. Resurrection is a Person-the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>WHAT THE SPIRIT BECAME</h2><p>Thus, the Spirit became the consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God, even the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. He also became the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). The Lord is Christ and the Spirit is the pneuma. Thus, the pneumatic Christ is the Lord Spirit. He is now the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). The Spirit of Jesus refers to Jesus in incarnation and human living. The Spirit of Christ refers to Christ in resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.<h2 class=head1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p>After the church was established and became degraded, as the life-giving and compound Spirit, He became the seven Spirits of God; that is, He is the one life-giving, compound Spirit but is intensified sevenfold (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).<h2 class=head1>THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h2><p>Furthermore, as the Spirit of life, He was breathed into the believers by Christ, in the night of His resurrection, as the gentle breath to be their indwelling Spirit to fill them inwardly (John 20:22; Acts 13:52).<h2 class=head1>THE ONE DIVINE APPLICATION</h2><p>He applies all that the Triune God is in Christ, all that the all-inclusive Christ is, and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained to all the people whom God has chosen; thus He became the one divine application. The Father made the economy, the Son accomplished it, and the Spirit applies to us what the Son has accomplished. Thus, the Spirit is the application.<p>As the application, the Spirit sanctifies, separates, God&#8217;s chosen people from the fallen people of the world and leads them to repent to God and receive Christ (1 Pet. 1:2). He regenerates the people who have received Christ as their Savior with His resurrection life to be the sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3; Titus 3:5; John 3:5; 1:12). He sanctifies the regenerated sons of God with the holy nature of God (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22) and renews the sanctified saints (Titus 3:5). He transforms the renewed saints metabolically into the glorious image of Christ (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29) and conforms the transformed saints to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). The Spirit also seals the believers with all that Christ is and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, thus dispensing all the divine elements of Christ into the very being of the believers until they will be redeemed in their body, that is, transfigured to be like the glorious body of Christ (Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22; Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21).<p>The Spirit is the pledge from God to the believers guaranteeing that the Triune God is their inheritance (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5). He, as the compound ointment, anoints the believers with the divine elements of Christ (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27). He witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom. 8:16). He, as the Spirit of life and the Spirit of God, indwells the believers, imparting life and peace to them and even life to their mortal bodies (Rom. 8:2, 9, 11, 6).<p>The one Spirit intercedes with groanings for the believers who are transformed by God under the working together of all things (Rom. 8:26-28). He, as the indwelling Spirit, is the One in whom the believers pray in their spirit (Jude 20; Eph. 6:18). He holds the sword of the Spirit of God for the believers to take the offensive in the spiritual warfare (Eph. 6:17-18). He comforts the believers (John 14:16; Acts 9:31). He leads the sons of God (Rom. 8:14). He, who searches all things, even the depths of God, reveals all the things that God has done for the believers (1 Cor. 2:10).<p>He, as the life-giving Spirit, gives life to the word of God, through whom the new testament ministers minister the word of God (2 Cor. 3:5-6). He is the Spirit of the new testament ministry of righteousness (2 Cor. 3:8-9; 4:1). He imparts righteousness, peace, and joy into the believers as the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). As the flow of God (John 7:38), He transmits in His fellowship the grace of Christ, the element of the divine life, with the love of God, the source of the grace of Christ (2 Cor. 13:14). As the dispenser of what God is in Christ as grace to the believers, He dispenses the reality of God as grace to them (Heb. 10:29).<p>The Spirit sets apart and sends out the apostles to spread the gospel of Christ (Acts 13:2, 4). He leads the apostles in their trips for the gospel spreading (Acts 16:6-7). He prophesies through the prophets concerning the apostles&#8217; sufferings and persecutions (Acts 21:11). He leads the apostles to speak things concerning God&#8217;s dealings with His people (1 Cor. 7:40).<p>He distributes different gifts to the believers (1 Cor. 12:4-11). He, as the reality of the speaking Christ, speaks to all the churches, calling for overcomers in the degradation of the church (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26, 29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22). As the essence of the Body of Christ, all that He works in and on the believers is for the constitution, the building, of the Body of Christ in Him as the oneness (Eph. 4:3-4).<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF POWER</h2><p>As the Spirit of power, He was poured upon the believers by the Christ in ascension as the violent wind to be the power to fill them outwardly for their spreading of the gospel of Christ (Acts 2:2-4, 17-18, 33; 1:8). First, Christ breathed this Spirit as the gentle breath into the disciples to be the indwelling Spirit. Now in His ascension, Christ poured out the Spirit as the violent wind, not for their life but for their ministry to spread the gospel. The inner Spirit as the breath is for life. The outpoured Spirit of power as the wind is for work.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</h2><p>Such an all-inclusive, compound, consummated, life-giving Spirit, the consummated Triune God as the Bridegroom, and God&#8217;s redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified church as the bride, say, &#8220;Come!&#8221; (Rev. 22:17). Eventually, this all-inclusive Spirit becomes the Bridegroom to marry God&#8217;s redeemed. That&#8217;s us. Then there is such a couple. The consummated Triune God is married to His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified people. They are regenerated in their spirit, transformed in their soul, and glorified in their body to match the marrying God. God and His wife are thus exactly the same in life, in nature, and in expression, just as Eve was the same as Adam. This all-inclusive Bridegroom will be a fulfillment of the type of Adam, marrying one who is out of Him and transformed into His image, glorified with His glory, and brought back to Him to be one couple. This is the end of the Bible.<p>Now we have seen the one Bible, the one God, the one Christ, and the one Spirit. The one Bible is a revelation of the Triune God; the Father is the source and substance, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence to apply the consummated Triune God to His chosen and redeemed people.<p>I have purposely released these ten &#8220;ones&#8221; because I do not know how long the Lord will keep me here, so I must give you a very basic and all-inclusive view of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. All the co-workers and elders should know this. By this fellowship we can see clearly what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is. It is not to recover baptism by immersion or the Lord&#8217;s table with one cup and one bread. These are not the major items of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. I feel that I have been in the Lord&#8217;s hands to finish the full interpretation of the whole Bible. Now I want to present these ten &#8220;ones&#8221; as the real conclusion to this interpretation.<h1 class=series>THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL &#8220;ONES&#8221; FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>ONE LIFE-ONE ELEMENT, ONE SALVATION-ONE WAY OF SAVING, AND ONE KIND OF LIVING-ONE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>One life-one element:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The life of the Triune God embodied in Christ-Eph. 4:18.</li>	<li>This life is eternal-John 3:15.</li>	<li>This life is in Christ-John 1:4.</li>	<li>Christ is this life and its Author-John 11:25; 14:6; Acts 3:15.</li>	<li>The Spirit of God is of this life-Rom. 8:2.</li>	<li>This life, which is Christ, is the believers&#8217; life-Col. 3:4.</li>	<li>This life is the divine element of the Triune God and Christ:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God gives His chosen people repentance unto this life and has appointed, ordained, them to receive this life-Acts 11:18; 13:48.</li>		<li>God regenerates the believers with this life-John 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>		<li>Christ&#8217;s righteous act is unto justification of this life-Rom. 5:18b.</li>		<li>Christ saves His believers subjectively in this life-Rom. 5:10b.</li>		<li>The believers walk in the newness of this life-Rom. 6:4.</li>		<li>The mind of the seeking believers set on the spirit is life and peace-Rom. 8:6b.</li>		<li>Grace reigns through righteousness unto this life-Rom. 5:21.</li>		<li>The overcoming believers reign by the abundant grace and gift of righteousness in this life-Rom. 5:17.</li>		<li>The believers who forsake all for Christ will inherit this life in the kingdom age-Matt. 19:29.</li>		<li>The overcomers will eat of the tree of this life in the kingdom age as a reward-Rev. 2:7.</li>		<li>The tree of this life with the water of this life in the river proceeding from the throne of God will be the unique supply to the entire New Jerusalem and will be partaken of by those who wash their robes-Rev. 22:1-2, 14.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>One salvation-one way of saving:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Based upon God&#8217;s love (the source of God&#8217;s grace) and God&#8217;s grace (the expression of God&#8217;s love)-Eph. 2:4-5.</li>	<li>Through the death of Christ:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>For God&#8217;s redemption-Rom. 3:24b.</li>		<li>For God&#8217;s forgiveness of sins-Acts 10:43.</li>		<li>For the believers&#8217; reconciliation to God-Rom. 5:10.</li>		<li>For God&#8217;s justification-Rom. 3:24a.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Through the life of Christ by the Spirit of life-Rom. 5:10; 8:2:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>From regenerating the believers with the divine element of Christ&#8217;s life-John 3:5; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>		<li>Through:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Sanctifying the regenerated believers with the divine element of God&#8217;s holy nature-Rom. 6:19, 22.</li>			<li>Renewing the sanctified believers with the newness of life-Titus 3:5; Rom. 6:4.</li>			<li>Transforming the renewed believers with the glorious element of Christ&#8217;s life by the Lord Spirit-Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>			<li>Conforming the transformed believers with the divine element of the life of the firstborn Son of God-Rom. 8:29.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Unto the glorification of the conformed believers with the glory of God-Rom. 8:30.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>One kind of living-one manifestation of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By the power of the resurrection of Christ to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10), dying to the self, the natural man, the old man, and the flesh (Matt. 16:24; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 5:24) from the power of Satan, the world, and sin (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; Rom. 6:2).</li>	<li>By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to live Christ and magnify Him-Phil. 1:19-21.</li>	<li>By the life of the God-man to live the overcomers&#8217; life-Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21.</li>	<li>By the growth in the life of Christ unto maturity for the building up of the Body of Christ-Eph. 4:15-16.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your oracle, Your speaking in Your recovery for the past more than seventy years. Today You are still speaking. We have the assurance that You are continuing to speak to us in order to enrich Your recovery and strengthen us. Lord, be with us through the meeting. Pour out Your Spirit as the reality of Yourself upon this meeting, and strengthen us and cover us with Your prevailing blood against the enemy&#8217;s attacks. Amen.<p>For everything mentioned in these outlines on the ten &#8220;ones,&#8221; we have to go to the Life-study Messages for the details. If we do not go there, we will not really know what these outlines are talking about.<p>In this message we want to see three more &#8220;ones.&#8221; These are the one life, the one salvation, and the one kind of living. In the Body of Christ, we enjoy one life as one element, one salvation as one way of saving, and one kind of living as one manifestation of Christ.<h2 class=head1>ONE LIFE-ONE ELEMENT</h2><p>The element is the very substance of a certain matter. Wood has its element, and iron has its element. Everything of a solid, physical substance has its element. This divine life of Christ is the very element of God, especially in saving us.<h2 class=head2>The Life of the Triune God Embodied in Christ to Be the Believers&#8217; Life</h2><p>This life is the life of the Triune God embodied in Christ (Eph. 4:18). There is one life of Christ, but Christ is the embodiment of God, so this one life is God&#8217;s life embodied. Life is invisible. No one can see our life. It is untouchable. But John in his first Epistle says this very eternal life is visible (1:1). They heard it, saw it, beheld it, touched it, and handled it because this life became a man, and that man is the embodiment of God.<p>This life is eternal (John 3:15) in nature, in time, and in every way. Eternal means that there is no beginning and no ending. This life is in Christ. John 1:4 says that in Him is life. Christ is this life and its Author (John 11:25; 14:6; Acts 3:15). The Spirit of God is of this life (Rom. 8:2), and this life, which is Christ, is the believers&#8217; life (Col. 3:4).<h2 class=head2>The Divine Element of the Triune God and Christ</h2><p>This life is the divine element of the Triune God and Christ. God gives His chosen people repentance unto this life and has appointed, ordained, them to receive this life (Acts 11:18; 13:48). I grew up as a Chinese person in an old, conservative, pagan country. How could I believe in Christ? This could only have taken place because of God&#8217;s ordination. Eventually, God gave me the gift of repentance, and I accepted, received, Christ. This was ordained by God. All the believers were ordained by Him to receive eternal life.<p>God regenerates the believers with this life (John 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:3). Also, Christ&#8217;s righteous act is unto, or for, justification of this life (Rom. 5:18b). This righteous act is His death. He died on the cross according to God&#8217;s will for us to be justified by God that we may receive life. Thus, the death of Christ and the justification of Christ are for one thing-that we may have this life.<p>Christ saves His believers subjectively in this life (Rom. 5:10b). Most Christians know they were saved by Christ&#8217;s death, but very few know that we are saved much more by His life. Romans 5:10 says that since we have been reconciled through His death, we shall be saved much more in His life. All of the Epistles are on the subject of the one life of Christ as the element of Christ&#8217;s salvation. Eventually in Romans 5, we reign in this life through Christ&#8217;s bountiful grace and His bountiful gift of righteousness (v. 17).<p>The believers walk in the newness of this life (Rom. 6:4), the mind of the seeking believers set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6b), and grace reigns through righteousness unto this life (Rom. 5:21). Grace as a king reigns. Not only grace reigns, but also we, the seeking ones, the overcomers, reign in this life by the abundant grace and gift of righteousness (Rom. 5:17).<p>The believers who forsake all for Christ will inherit this life in the kingdom age (Matt. 19:29). In order to gain this inheritance, we have to overcome. This inheritance is not for salvation but for a reward in the coming age (Luke 18:29-30) in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age. The overcomers will eat of the tree of this life in the kingdom age as a reward (Rev. 2:7). This is an item of the inheritance of this eternal life in the kingdom.<p>Christ as life is given to us today for our salvation as a gift. But in the kingdom age, Christ will be our portion of enjoyment as a reward. Christ to us today is a free gift. All we need to do is to repent and believe to receive Him. Then if we overcome, He will be not only a gift but also a reward to us. Otherwise, we will miss this inheritance in the thousand-year kingdom. In the Gospel of life, the Gospel of John, this life is received. In the Gospel of the kingdom, the Gospel of Matthew, this life will be an inheritance. To inherit it, we have to pay the price.<p>The tree of this life with the water of this life in the river proceeding from the throne of God will be the unique supply to the entire New Jerusalem and will be partaken of by those who wash their robes (Rev. 22:1-2, 14). This will be after the thousand-year kingdom. By the discipline in the thousand years, all the believers who did not overcome will be perfected. In other words, they will become mature to be the overcomers also (Rev. 21:7). They will not be the early overcomers who will enter into the kingdom, but the later overcomers who will enjoy the New Jerusalem in eternity. In the New Jerusalem, the supply is the tree of life, which is Christ as life.<p>Thus, Christ as life to us is of three ages. In the present age, Christ as life is a gift; in the coming age, He will be a reward; and in the new heaven and new earth, in the eternal age, He will be the supply. In the next age, for those who have become the overcomers, Christ will be a reward. Then after the millennium all the defeated ones will also be made overcomers. They will join the early overcomers to enjoy Christ as life, as the eternal, bountiful supply, in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.<h2 class=head1>ONE SALVATION-ONE WAY OF SAVING</h2><p>The one life, Christ&#8217;s life, the eternal life, is for our salvation, and this is the one way of saving. Only this salvation is the way of saving.<h2 class=head2>Based upon God&#8217;s Love and God&#8217;s Grace</h2><p>Our salvation is based upon God&#8217;s love, the source of God&#8217;s grace, and God&#8217;s grace, the expression of God&#8217;s love (Eph. 2:4-5). The Father is the source. We are saved by His grace because of His great love. Our salvation is based on the First of the Trinity, the Father, in His love and grace.<h2 class=head2>Through the Death of Christ</h2><p>The one salvation is through the death of Christ for God&#8217;s redemption (Rom. 3:24b), for God&#8217;s forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43), for the believers&#8217; reconciliation to God (Rom. 5:10), and for God&#8217;s justification (Rom. 3:24a).<h2 class=head2>Through the Life of Christ</h2><p>This salvation is also through the life of Christ by the Spirit of life (Rom. 5:10; 8:2). Our salvation is from the Father as the base, through the Son, and by the Spirit.<p>The salvation by the Spirit begins from regenerating the believers with the divine element of Christ&#8217;s life (John 3:5; 1 Pet. 1:3). This salvation goes on through sanctifying the regenerated believers with the divine element of God&#8217;s holy nature (Rom. 6:19, 22). Regeneration is by God&#8217;s life, and sanctification is with the holy nature of God.<p>The Spirit of life also renews the sanctified believers with the newness of life (Titus 3:5; Rom. 6:4) and transforms the renewed believers with the glorious element of Christ&#8217;s life by the Lord Spirit (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Eventually, this life works to conform the transformed believers with the divine element of the life of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29).<h2 class=head2>Unto Glorification</h2><p>The one salvation is unto the glorification of the conformed believers with the glory of God (Rom. 8:30).<h2 class=head1>ONE KIND OF LIVING-ONE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST</h2><p>Life is for salvation, salvation produces a living, and this living is the one manifestation of Christ.<h2 class=head2>By the Power of the Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>First, this one kind of living is by the power of the resurrection of Christ to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10), dying to the self, the natural man, the old man, and the flesh (Matt. 16:24; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 5:24) from the power of Satan, the world, and sin (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; Rom. 6:2).<h2 class=head2>By the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</h2><p>This one living is also by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to live Christ and magnify Him (Phil. 1:19-21). To die to self, the natural man, the old man, and the flesh is by the power of resurrection. To magnify Christ is by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head2>By the Life of the God-man</h2><p>We live to manifest Christ by the life of the God-man to live the overcomers&#8217; life (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). We are the God-men. We have a life which is the God-man life, by which we can live an overcoming life.<h2 class=head2>By the Growth in the Life of Christ</h2><p>Finally, this one kind of living is by the growth in the life of Christ unto maturity for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:15-16).<p>We praise the Lord for His mercy that through the last seventy-three years He has given us this inheritance of the truth which is based upon the interpretation of all the best of the Bible students and teachers throughout the past centuries. The church fathers saw the truth concerning the Triune God. Even though this fact is in the Bible, the word triune is not there. The church fathers saw that our God who is one, is triune, so they invented the word triune. Later, the Lord raised up some to see the inner life. William Law stressed the Spirit. Then Andrew Murray saw that in the Spirit of the glorified Jesus there is humanity. Jessie Penn-Lewis saw the subjective death of Christ, and Brother Austin-Sparks saw the principles of resurrection for the Body. Then Brother Watchman Nee saw something further and put all the foregoing things together as one package. I say this with tears. He passed on this package to me.<p>When I came to the United States, we invented many new terms to convey the fresh revelations we saw. In these past three years the Lord has brought us to the high peak of His divine revelation. Now we have a complete gift of the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages. We should treasure this. This does not mean that we exalt Watchman Nee or Witness Lee. Instead, we exalt the Triune God who spoke through many interpreters throughout the centuries and who used two brothers to present the crystallization of the accumulated understanding of the divine revelation to us.<p>I know this is the end time. The Lord will close this age with all the truths conveyed in the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages. Sooner or later all these truths will go out, and this will conquer the defective theology of Christianity.<h1 class=series>THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL &#8220;ONES&#8221; FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>ONE TESTIMONY-ONE EXPRESSION, ONE BODY-ONE ORGANISM, AND ONE CITY-ONE CONSUMMATION</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>One testimony-one expression:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ is the faithful Witness of God testifying in His human living what God is-Rev. 1:5;

We worship You. In this last message, Lord, be with us, giving us an excellent conclusion. Lord, help us. We need You. We need You in every way. Amen.<p>In the previous message we saw the one life, one salvation, and one living. These three are one group. Life saves, and salvation produces and issues in a living. In this message we want to see the one testimony, one Body, and one city. The testimony is the golden lampstands. These are the testimony of the Body, which is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, and this Body consummates in the one city.<h2 class=head1>ONE TESTIMONY-ONE EXPRESSION</h2><h2 class=head2>Christ Being the Faithful Witness</h2><p>Christ is the faithful Witness of God, testifying in His human living what God is (Rev. 1:5; 3:14). First, our Head is the witness, bearing the testimony of God.<h2 class=head2>The Believers Being the Witnesses of Christ</h2><p>The believers are the witnesses of Christ for the spreading of His gospel (Acts 1:8). We continue Christ to be witnesses, witnessing the all-inclusive Christ for the spreading of the gospel to produce His Body.<p>We testify the human living of Christ (Acts 10:37-39a) and His death, resurrection, and ascension (Acts 2:30-36; 3:15; 10:39b-41). In Acts, this was the apostles&#8216; testimony. This testimony is to save sinners to be the members of Christ for the building up of His Body (Acts 2:37-42; 4:10-12; 10:42-43). We do not take so-called soul winning as our object of preaching the gospel so that people may go to heaven. Our object of the preaching of the gospel is to win sinners so that they may become members of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Local Churches Being the Golden Lampstands</h2><p>The local churches, composed with the believers to be the Body of Christ, are the golden lampstands (Rev. 1:11-12). The lampstands are a testimony.<h2 class=head2>The Golden Lampstands Being Identical</h2><p>All the golden lampstands are identical in nature, in shape, and in function to be the one expression of Christ. If the seven lampstands were put before us, we would not be able to distinguish them, because they are identical. Without numbering them, no one could discern which lampstand is which. They all are identical in their golden nature, the divine nature, in their shape, the form of Christ, and in their function, the shining of the Spirit. The Father is the nature, the Son is the shape, the form, and the Spirit is the shining power. All the local churches should be identical in the same nature of God, form of Christ, and function of the Spirit.<p>The one expression of Christ is in the unique oneness of the Spirit of the unique Body of Christ (Eph. 4:3-4). Without the Spirit, we cannot have the oneness. This one expression is also in the unique fellowship of the unique Spirit, participating in the unique flow of the Triune God (1 John 1:3; 2 Cor. 13:14). There is only one Triune God and only one fellowship, one flow of the Spirit. The one expression of Christ is in the unique move of the unique God for the unique accomplishment of His unique economy (Eph. 1:10; 1 Tim. 1:4b) and in the unique blending in the unique life of Christ for His unique testimony in the universe (1 Cor. 12:24). Everything must be unique. If only the group of churches in your district are blended together, that is not the unique blending. That is a &#8220;sect blending.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>ONE BODY-ONE ORGANISM</h2><p>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God in His move. Life is a substance, the Triune God, and the organism is the visible expression of this substance.<p>The one Body is the constitution of the divinity of the processed and consummated Triune God with the humanity of all His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people (Eph. 4:4-6). The Body is constituted with the Triune God-with the Father as the source, the substance, with the Son as the element, the expression, and with the Spirit as the essence. This Triune God in His divinity is mingled with the humanity of His redeemed people. We are redeemed for regeneration and transformation.<p>We should not have and cannot have the Body life in our natural life, in our natural man. We must be redeemed by the blood, regenerated by the Spirit, and transformed through the cross of Christ. The cross of Christ must cross us out. Then we become transformed new men. All the members of the Body are the new men, and the new men added together are one new man.<p>According to Colossians 3:10-11, all the members of this new man should be Christ. Paul said, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). He also said, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ for His magnification&#8221; (Phil. 1:19-21). We must be Christ; then we can be His Body. A person&#8217;s fingers, toes, and nose are his parts, and all the parts of a person added together equal that person. We have to realize the Body in such an intrinsic way. It is not just that we are one, that we have no opinion, and that we speak the same thing. This is inadequate. We must be out; Christ must be in. We die that He may live.<p>The one Body, the one organism, is the accomplishment of God&#8217;s economy according to the good pleasure, the heart&#8217;s desire, of His will (Eph. 1:5). This Body is built with Christ&#8217;s life as its element, the Spirit of reality as its essence, and the person of God as its source (Eph. 4:4-6) and built up by the perfected saints who are perfected by the gifted members (Eph. 4:11-12). If we are going to build up the Body, we must be perfected. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers have the ability to perfect the saints. Then the saints are good for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>The one Body is also built up with the mature believers as its constituents through their growth in the life of Christ unto maturity. It is also built up by itself in love (Eph. 4:15-16). The Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply (the particular gifted members) and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part, (all the saints). The joints are like the steel frame of a building, and the parts are like the material that fills in the gaps. The built up Body will consummate in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21-22).<h2 class=head1>ONE CITY-ONE CONSUMMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>The Holy City, New Jerusalem</h2><p>The title the holy city, New Jerusalem implies that it is not only holy but also new (Rev. 21:2). It is holy because it is separated and sanctified unto God as something belonging to God according to His holy nature. It is new because it, as the main part of God&#8217;s new creation, has God&#8217;s nature of newness (2 Cor. 5:17).<h2 class=head2>The Ultimate Consummation of the Work for God&#8217;s New Creation</h2><p>The holy city New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the work for God&#8217;s new creation out of God&#8217;s old creation through all the four ages of man&#8217;s history (the age before the law, the age of law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom), from God&#8217;s making the spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life to the accomplishment of this city for the good pleasure of His will, which is the intent of His eternal economy. God&#8217;s new creation is made out of the old creation through four ages. This work began from God&#8217;s creating man with a spirit and putting him before the tree of life and ends with the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>The Unique Constitution</h2><p>The one city is the unique constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people chosen by Him in eternity past.<h2 class=head2>The Tabernacle of God and the Temple of God</h2><p>In its humanity it is the tabernacle of God (the dwelling place of God among men who is the unique King reigning over the entire new heaven and new earth), and in its divinity it is the temple of God (the dwelling place of God&#8217;s redeemed people serving Him as a royal priestly family who are the kings reigning over the nations around the New Jerusalem in eternity). In its humanity, the New Jerusalem is God&#8217;s tabernacle with man as God&#8217;s dwelling place. In its divinity, the New Jerusalem is the temple with God as man&#8217;s dwelling place.<h2 class=head2>The Materials of Its Structure</h2><p>Now we want to see the materials of the structure of the one city. Its base is gold, signifying the nature of God (Rev. 21:18b), its gates are pearls, signifying the issue of Christ&#8217;s redeeming death and life-dispensing resurrection (21:21a), and its wall with its foundations is precious stones, signifying the product of the transforming Spirit (21:18a, 19-20). So the three main materials of the city are God the Father as the base, God the Son as the gates, and God the Spirit as the wall with its foundations.<h2 class=head2>Its Street</h2><p>The city&#8217;s street upon its golden base joining to its throne is gold, signifying God&#8217;s nature, and is uniquely one, spiraling from the top of its base to reach all its twelve gates (21:21b).<h2 class=head2>Its Glory</h2><p>Its glory is the most excellent glory of God shining in Christ throughout the entire city (21:11).<h2 class=head2>Its Light</h2><p>Its light is God shining in Christ the Lamb as the lamp (21:23).<h2 class=head2>Its Throne</h2><p>Its throne is the throne of the Lamb-God upon its golden base joining with its golden street as its center for its government (22:1b). We have to pay attention to the fact that the throne is joined with the base and joined with the golden street spiraling to reach all the twelve gates.<h2 class=head2>Its Supply</h2><p>Its supply is the tree of life, signifying the all-inclusive Christ of life, growing on the two banks of the river of the water of life (22:2) and the river of the water of life, signifying the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit, flowing from the throne of the Lamb-God (22:1a).<h2 class=head2>The Wife of Christ</h2><p>The one city is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ who is the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God (21:9b, 2).<h2 class=head2>Expressing the Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ</h2><p>Every part of this unique city expresses the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. Today our work for the Lord with its issue should be governed and directed by this pattern. What is unveiled in the vision of this unique city should be the model of what we are and how we work.<h2 class=head2>The Restored Nations</h2><p>The restored but not saved nations, the sheep, come from the judgment of Christ on His throne of glory, justified and sent by Him (Matt. 25:31-46) to be the people who are the subjects of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. The nations are the subjects ruled by the royal family, composed of Christ and His co-kings.<h2 class=head1>A CONCLUDING NOTE</h2><p>All of us, the co-workers and the elders, need to see the vision of these ten great critical &#8220;ones.&#8221; Every &#8220;one&#8221; should be a strong principle that directs, corrects, adjusts, and regulates us for the performing of the proper oneness of the Body of Christ today and the keeping of us on the right track of the Lord&#8217;s work, so that we will not be ashamed at the judgment seat of our Lord but rather be rewarded by Him for the participation in His kingship and priesthood in the kingdom.<p>These ten &#8220;ones&#8221; tell us that if we do not take the Lord&#8217;s way for the building up of the Body, we have no way. This means that if we are not in the recovery way, there is no way. In the New Jerusalem, there is only one way, one street. The one street makes us one with everyone. I must be faithful to present these ten &#8220;ones&#8221; to you and to let you know that this is the only way. There is no other way for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>I believe that eventually the truths of the Lord&#8217;s recovery will conquer the theology of Christianity, and the revelation of the recovery will captivate all the seeking ones to be the overcomers. This will close this age and bring in the kingdom with its kings. We should present on the altar all that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do, praying, &#8220;Lord, I offer all to You for You to conquer Christianity by the divine revelations in the recovery.&#8221;</body></html>
