   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Cloud of Smoke</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as a Shade by Day from the Heat</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Brightness of a Fiery Flame by Night,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both Being Created by God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This covering canopy of glory is also a cloud of smoke as a shade by day from the heat and the brightness of a fiery flame by night against the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both the cloud of smoke and the brightness of a fiery flame are created by God Exo 40:34-35, 38; Num 9:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the day of restoration comes, there will be over Mount Zion a cloud of smoke in the day and the brightness of a fiery flame in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not consider that the cloud of smoke and the brightness of a fiery flame are physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah tells us that Jehovah will create them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that they will be something which has never before existed, something which will be created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's glory as the cloud of smoke and the brightness of the fiery flame will remain on Mount Zion all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the day His glory will be as a covering cloud of smoke to be a shade from the heat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the night His glory will be as the shining brightness of a fiery flame to keep God's people away from darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God Himself as the glory expressed in Christ will remain as a canopy over Mount Zion to cover His interests, which include His holy temple, His holy people, and all His holy convocations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our revised translation of Isaiah 4:5 conveys the proper spiritual meaning of Christ being a covering canopy of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse says, "Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day, and the brightness of a fiery flame by night; for over all, the glory will be a canopy."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The comma in the phrase "for over all, the glory will be a canopy" is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the comma were removed from this phrase, this would mean that the canopy and the glory are two separate items and that the canopy covers and protects God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is against the spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's glory does not need anything to cover or protect it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, His glory is always covering other things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Concordant Version of Isaiah also puts a comma between "all" and "the glory."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to our revised translation, over Mount Zion, over the temple, and over the holy convocations, the glory will be a canopy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>C. An Overshadowing Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>of Grace in Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ will also be an overshadowing tabernacle of grace in humanity Isa 4:6, John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being Christ in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That Expresses His Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This overshadowing tabernacle of grace is Christ in His humanity, which expresses His divinity John 1:14b .</S>
