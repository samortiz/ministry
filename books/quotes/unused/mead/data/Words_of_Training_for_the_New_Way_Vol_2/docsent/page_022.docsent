   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN CONCERNING SOME PRACTICAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This morning we want to spend some time to study further the things we should do in the present stage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At present, we have over eighty meetings in different districts in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We call them simply the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, in the present stage, we have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FOUR GROUPS OF PEOPLE TAKING THE LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TO FUNCTION IN THE DISTRICT MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we will consider the situation of the brothers and sisters, district by district.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also have to consider the distribution of the elders, the co-workers, and the full-time trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, we have to take a look at the home meetings established among the new believers in each district.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the present arrangement, to have the church meetings and church services in the communities is a clear and accurate way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is much more practical and suitable than the former arrangement of meeting and serving in the meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without Monopolizing or Replacing</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the district meetings the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and the college students should all live in the Lord s Spirit in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When these four groups of people come to the meetings, they will spontaneously have something to supply others, be able to function, and be able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What I observed here last Lord s Day was quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I heard that the other districts were also quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders and co-workers all spoke in the meetings, and their speaking was fresh, high, living and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The full-timers and the college students were equally fresh in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a very good situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I hope you will be careful not to go to either extreme of not speaking at all or speaking too much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not give the other brothers and sisters an impression that we are monopolizing the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Taipei the elders, co-workers, full-time trainees, and college students make up about one quarter of the total number of attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would, of course, be very good if this one quarter would function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we must also remember that our functioning is only to take the lead, and not to replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this quarter replaces the three quarters, this will become the old system again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Formerly, it was one speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now it is a group speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is still not what we are after.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can encourage the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and college students to speak one by one in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we are just beginning to change the system, there is the need for you to take the lead to give the brothers and sisters an example and a model to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, while you are doing this, do not replace the others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am afraid that after hearing my word, you will not function at all next week in the district meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That would be what the Bible describes as, a cake not turned Hosea 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We as the cake must be turned repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So we still should speak in the district meetings, but we should not give others the feeling, These are the trained ones; we cannot match their speaking; we might as well let them speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they have such a feeling, that means we are dominating the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must guard against this danger.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, I point this out from the beginning, that we are to take the lead, and not to replace others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Standing Against the Natural Self</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and Sisters Keeping a Proper Position</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another thing, I have discovered is that, whether in the training meetings or in the church meetings, the young sisters are always stronger than the young brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe the main reason might be that the Bible calls the woman the weaker, female vessel 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result, the young sisters are unwilling to be considered weak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, either they will not speak at all, or they will speak impressively at the first try.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, there is somewhat a feeling of inferiority with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Also, by nature, males are inferior to females in singing and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Girls also speak earlier than boys do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This may be one of the reasons for the sisters aggressiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in the matter of speaking, we must stand against our natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who by nature want to speak should refrain from speaking, and those who by nature do not want to speak should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am saying this to adjust you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that you will not feel troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must contribute your portion in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The New Testament shows us that every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head 1 Cor 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that when speaking in the meetings, the sisters should not forget that they are still sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some words, if spoken by brothers, will not sound strange.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if they jump a little, that will not surprise others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if the sisters, even though they are young, jump and speak in a wild way in the meetings, people will feel it is inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is because in God s creation there is the distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that the sisters would all function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have the riches, and these riches should be exhibited, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, in functioning, do not forget that you are sisters.</S>
