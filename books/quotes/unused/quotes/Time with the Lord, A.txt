All this must be forgotten and our whole attention given to spending proper and adequate time in the Lord's presence
For at least thirty minutes each day, we must learn not to exercise our mind too much, but simply to exercise our spirit in pray-reading
The whole situation among us will be radically changed, not by teaching, studying, and exhorting, but by contacting the Lord
If by the Lord's mercy and grace we desire and agree to spend more time daily in the presence of the Lord, what shall we do?
We must contact the Lord by mingling our reading of the Bible with prayer, and by mingling our prayer with reading
Do not try to pray long sentence prayers, and do not pray for many things, asking the Lord to do something for you
The valuable prayer, the prayer which contacts the Lord, is to utter or express what is responding within you as you read the Word
If we ask Him to do this and that, He will say, 'Foolish child, it is unnecessary for you to ask Me to do all those things
God's Word is an enjoyment; after being taken into us and assimilated into our very being, it becomes joy within us and rejoicing without
From all these verses we realize that the Word of God is not only for us to learn, but more for us to taste, to eat, to enjoy, and to digest
Another important verse is 1 Timothy 4:6b: 'You will be a good member of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith'
Paul's emphasis is not that we should be taught with knowledge, but that we should be nourished with the riches of the Word
We should not just exercise our wonderful mind with our mysterious understanding to understand the Word of God
If we do not know how to pray-read, we will pray in the following way: first, we will rise early in the morning, feeling that we must pray
In all sixty-six books of the Bible we cannot find one verse which says that we should pray with our eyes closed
We would not argue in a doctrinal way, but we must realize that there is no need for us to close our eyes to pray
Although you may not understand a certain passage, you still are nourished, because there is really something of God in His Word
What the church needs today is not more knowledge and teachings, but nourishment, and the way the Lord nourishes His Body is by His Word
No teaching, doctrine, or knowledge can work Christ into us to such an extent; it is only by this way of prayer
