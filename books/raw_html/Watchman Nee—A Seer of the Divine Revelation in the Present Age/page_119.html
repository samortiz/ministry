<P>The following words are taken from the open letter in the nineteenth issue of The Present Testimony of January&#151; February 1931:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Some may think that the content of The Present Testimony is too deep and too specialized. However, many readers have written to us saying that while other magazines are greatly used by the Lord, The Present Testimony provides what the others do not. For this reason we are convinced that the command which we have received of the Lord is right. By the grace of the Lord, The Present Testimony will therefore continue to speak forth the deep things of God this year and in the years to come, the Lord willing.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Publication of The Present Testimony was suspended following the thirty-sixth issue of July&#151;August 1934 and was replaced by The Testimony in 1948. However, publication of The Present Testimony was resumed in January 1951.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Christian</H2><P>In order to lay a foundation for understanding his deeper periodical, The Present Testimony, Watchman issued another periodical called The Christian. In the Narration of the Past delivered on the Lord's Day, December 4, 1932, at a meeting in Shanghai, he referred to his burden concerning this paper:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Publication of The Christian began in January 1923. It was published at irregular intervals and was discontinued in 1925. While I was staying in Lo-Hsing Pagoda, I felt the need to issue a regular publication which would give more emphasis to the truths of salvation and the church and deal as well with prophecies and types. I intended this magazine (called The Christian) to be temporary in nature. In 1925 two issues were published; in 1926 ten issues were published; and in 1927, because of continuous demand, another twelve issues were published.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
