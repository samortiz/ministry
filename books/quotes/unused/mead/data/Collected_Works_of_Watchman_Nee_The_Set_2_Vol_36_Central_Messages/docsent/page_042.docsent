   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT PAUL KNEW Christ Being Our Hope</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus' own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said to Timothy, "Christ Jesus our hope" 1 Tim 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I like this word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you like it?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not say that our hope is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, he said Christ Jesus is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not put our hope in Him, and we do not draw hope from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, Christ Jesus is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ Being Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Again he said to the Colossians, "When Christ our life is manifested..."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not say, "When Christ is manifested."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, he said, "When Christ our life is manifested."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Christian does not have many matters; a Christian only has Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ Being Our Wisdom:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these messages, the one verse that we emphasize more than any other verse is 1 Corinthians 1:30.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does it say?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has not given us righteousness; He has given us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has not given us sanctification; He has given us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has not given us redemption; He has given us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has not given us wisdom; He has given us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why we say that the Christ of God is the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's Christ is God's matters and things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apart from Christ, God does not have any matter or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ Being Our Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God were to say to us, "I have made the Lord Jesus the Lord of righteousness; He is the One who justifies you," what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You would say "Yes, He has justified us."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God has not asked the Lord Jesus to be the Justifier; He has asked the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is this good?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is not the Justifier, but our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ Being Our Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul did not say that the Lord Jesus has become "the One that sanctifies."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, he said that Christ is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus is not sanctifying us; He Himself is becoming our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has made the Lord Jesus our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our sanctification is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our sanctification is not a thing; it is not an act or a behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our sanctification is a person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ Being Our Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Again Paul did not say that the Lord is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said that the Lord is our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is this not strange?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Corinthians 1:30 does not say that God has appointed the Lord Jesus to be a Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, it says that the Lord Jesus is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank the Lord that our Redeemer is Christ, and our redemption is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The One who sanctifies is Christ, and our sanctification is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The One who justifies is Christ, and our righteousness is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The One who gives wisdom is Christ, and that wisdom is also Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>WHAT DAVID KNEW Christ Being Our Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I stand here and say to you, "The Lord Jesus is our Savior," you will respond, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus is our Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But Psalm 27:1 tells us that the Lord is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It shows us that the Lord is our salvation and not our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is a fact that the Lord is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But God showed David that the Lord is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord is our Savior, but He is also our salvation; He is that very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus is the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is God's matters and God's things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus Himself is the very thing that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have no intention of remaining too long on the exposition of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am merely laying a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you spend some time to consider God's Word, you will see that Christ is God's things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God has not only given Him to be our Savior and our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He has not only given Him to be the Lord of sanctification and the Lord of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He has given us Christ to be our things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Righteousness is a thing, sanctification is a thing, and justification is a thing, or a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But Christ is these matters or things.</S>
