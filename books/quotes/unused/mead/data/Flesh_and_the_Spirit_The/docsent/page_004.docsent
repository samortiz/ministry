   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN BEING SATAN HIMSELF IN OUR FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sin is not evil deeds such as hating and killing others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are outward doings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are not sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sin itself, according to the Bible's revelation, is Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When sin came into the created man, Satan came into him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can use the illustration of a black bookmark being placed within a book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The book may be likened to something created by God and the black bookmark to sin being placed within it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day, Satan got into man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sin is Satan getting into you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sin is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans says that sin can deceive us, kill us 7:11 , and lord it over us, that is, have dominion over us 6:12, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these activities prove that sin is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This living person is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan outside of you is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Satan gets into you, that is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan in you is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to realize where Satan is in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul said in Romans 7 that he practiced what he hated v. 15 . Since this was the case, he said, "It is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me" v. 17 . Paul used the phrase no longer I twice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Galatians 2:20 he said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 7 he said, "It is no longer I..but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin is another person within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I may like to do something, but eventually I do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, I do what I hate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So it is no longer I, but another person who does it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This person is in my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul said, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells" v. 18 . In my flesh no good thing dwells, because the flesh is fully possessed, taken over, by Satan as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people do not believe that there is such a person as Satan in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They do not know that this person, whom they do not believe exists, is in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not believe that Satan exists and they do not know that while they are saying this, Satan is speaking in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They speak for Satan, whom they do not believe exists.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan is in man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have shown that the flesh is our corrupted body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The flesh also refers to the corrupted human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 3:20 says that by the law no flesh can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word flesh here does not refer to our polluted body but to our fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the works of the law no human being, no fallen one, can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That means none of the people who are flesh can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In God's eyes human beings are altogether flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genesis 6:3 tells us that at a certain point in the eyes of God, man became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man is totally flesh because the fallen being today is under the dominion of the fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every human being today in society is dominated by his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who sends people to Las Vegas into the casinos?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who sends people to the movie theaters?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The flesh sends them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In God's eyes we are totally flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In God's eyes we are no longer mere human beings, but we are flesh, which has been possessed, saturated, taken over, and mingled with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Look at today's society.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Outwardly, men behave like gentlemen; inwardly, they are flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Outwardly, women behave like ladies; inwardly, they are flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The husband is flesh; the wife is flesh; the boy is flesh; the girl is flesh; the gentleman is flesh; the executive is flesh; the janitor is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone is flesh, because everyone is under the dominion of Satan, having been corrupted by him.</S>
