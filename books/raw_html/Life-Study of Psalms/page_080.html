<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CHRIST PASSING THROUGH THE REDEEMING DEATH</H2><P>Verses 1-21 show us Christ passing through the redeeming death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. David's Groaning Cry to God</H2><P>Verses 1b-5 are David's groaning cry to God. David was complaining to God. He asked God why He had forsaken him, saying that he called out to God, but God did not answer him. Our God is loving and is also very patient with us. David was groaning before God. Have we ever groaned before God? We all may have prayed, but not many of us have groaned before God.</P><P>Our God is surely a loving God, but sometimes it seems that He is not so loving. Instead of being promoted, a brother may be laid off. Another brother may not be healed of his illness, even though he has prayed for three months. God surely hears our prayers, but many times He does not answer our prayers which are not according to His desire, His economy, His plan. When our prayer does not work, we have to learn to come to God to complain to Him. We should not be those who merely praise or pray to God. We need to realize that God likes to hear our complaints.</P><P>Verse 1 says, "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" This word was spoken by David in his suffering. Actually, it became a prophecy concerning Christ in His suffering of His redeeming death. It was quoted by the Lord Jesus while He was suffering the crucifixion (Matt. 27:46).</P><P>Verses 2-5 are the continuation of David's groaning prayer, which turned from groaning to praising. After this, Christ continued to speak. Beginning from verse six, the voice changes to another person, to Christ. This is the way the Psalms were written. While David was speaking, eventually Christ came in to speak in his speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Suffering David Typifying<br>Christ Passing through His Death</H2><P>In Psalm 22 we see the suffering David typifying Christ passing through His death (vv. 1a, 6-21). David and Solomon were both types of Christ. David typifies the suffering Christ, and Solomon typifies the reigning and ruling Christ in His kingship.</P>
