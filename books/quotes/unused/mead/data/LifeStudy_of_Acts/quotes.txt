[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE ONE THE POSITION OF THE BOOK Scripture Reading: Luke 24:44-49; Mark 16:15-16, 19-20; Matt 28:18-20; Acts 1:1-2
[2]  With this message we begin the Life-study of the Acts of the apostles.
[3]  As we come to the book of Acts, we need to realize that both this book and the Gospel of Luke were written by the same person.
[4]  The first two verses of Acts indicate that this book is the continuation of Luke s Gospel: The first account I made, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until the day in which He was taken up, having given command through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose.
[5]  My burden in this message is to point out the position of the book of Acts in the arrangement of the contents of the Scriptures.
[6]  In the Gospels we have the unveiling of a wonderful Person.
[7]  In a brief way we have presented the complete revelation of Christ in the four Gospels.
[8]  We need to see that Jesus Christ was prophesied and typified in the Old Testament, that He was conceived in the womb of a virgin, that He was born of a virgin to become the God-man, that He lived a life of expressing the divine attributes in His human virtues, that He passed through death and entered into resurrection, becoming the reaching Spirit, and that in resurrection He breathed Himself into His disciples as the life-giving Spirit.
[9]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the book of Acts may be considered the dividing line, or the backbone, of the New Testament.
[10]  Through His witnesses the resurrected Christ in His ascension propagates Himself for the producing of the churches.
[11]  This indicates that the churches should not be raised up and established merely by human hands.
[12]  Every local church must be born of Christ, brought forth by Christ s propagation in His divine and resurrected life.
[13]  The book of Acts has three main sections: the introduction 1:1-2 , the preparation 1:3-26 , and the propagation 2:1 28:31 .
[14]  We need to read the Bible again and again.
[15]  This means that we need to know the written Word and be filled with it.
[16]  In Matthew 16 Peter received a heavenly vision and declared, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . The Lord answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens v. 17 . After the Lord spoke about the church and the kingdom, He went on to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day v. 21 . But Peter began to rebuke Him saying, God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You! v. 22 . The Lord then turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men v. 23 .
[17]  After the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples, He stayed with them economically for forty days.
[18]  Concerning this, Acts 1:3 says, To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, through a period of forty days, appearing to them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.
[19]  LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FOUR INTRODUCTION AND THE PREPARATION 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 1:1-26
[20]  We have seen that 1:1-2 is the introduction to the book of Acts.
[21]  Then in 1:3-26 we have the preparation both on the Lord s side and on the side of His disciples.
[22]  As those who have received the divine life, we not only know what the kingdom of God is; we become parts of this kingdom.
[23]  If a dog could be born of the human life and thereby become a human being, this human being would automatically become a part of the human kingdom.
[24]  Yes, you have the divine life, and because you have this life you are part of the kingdom of God.
[25]  In 1:8 the Lord went on to say, But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.
[26]  To receive power is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit v. 5 for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father v. 4 .
[27]  To have the Holy Spirit upon us is different from having the Holy Spirit in us John 14:17 .
[28]  The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord s resurrection to be the Spirit of life to them essentially.
[29]  Acts 1:3-26 is a section concerned with preparation.
[30]  As we have seen, in 1:3-8 we have Christ s preparation of the disciples in His resurrection.
[31]  In Acts, the Lord s ministry in heaven, carried out through His believers in His resurrection and ascension, spreads Him as the development of the kingdom of God for the building up of the church Matt 16:18 throughout the entire world to constitute His Body, His fullness Eph 1:23 , to express Him, even the fullness of God Eph 3:19 for God s expression.
[32]  Between His ascension and His coming back there is the dispensation of grace so that He as the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , may apply His all-inclusive redemption to God s chosen people for their full salvation, that He may produce and build up the church, as His Body, for the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth.
[33]  After witnessing the Lord s ascension, the disciples returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day s journey away v. 12 . The disciples returned to Jerusalem to keep the Lord s words in Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:4, so that they might receive the Spirit of power economically as promised by the Father.
[34]  They were all Galileans v. 11 . For them to stay in Jerusalem, especially under the threatening of the Jewish leaders, meant that they were risking their lives.
[35]  The disciples might have prayed to be clothed with the Spirit of power, the promise of the Father, for which the Lord had charged them to remain in Jerusalem Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4 , and for the commission given to them by the Lord in Luke 24:47 and 48 and Acts 1:8 to bear His testimony to the remotest part of the earth.
[36]  Choosing Matthias To Replace Judas as One of the Twelve Apostles
[37]  Acts 1:15 and 16 say, And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers and there was a crowd of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty and said, Men, brothers, the Scripture must be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke before through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who seized Jesus.
[38]  Before the Lord s death Peter often spoke nonsensically Matt 16:22-23; 17:24-26; 26:33-35 , but after the Lord s resurrection he could expound the Old Testament prophecies properly in their right significance in verses 16 through 20.
[39]  This also is proof that the disciples, before they received the Spirit of power economically on the day of Pentecost, had received the Spirit of life essentially on the day of the Lord s resurrection.
[40]  After speaking further regarding the death of Judas and the prophecies concerning him, Peter went on to say, It is necessary therefore that of the men who accompanied us in all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when He was taken up from us, one of these should become a witness of His resurrection with us vv.
[41]  They had received the indwelling Spirit on the day of the Lord s resurrection, and they were trained by the Lord to practice His invisible presence for forty days before His ascension v. 3 . Yet it was still difficult for them to drop the old traditional way of seeking God s leading by casting lots Lev 16:8; Josh 14:2; 1 Sam 14:41; Neh 10:34; 11:1; Prov 16:33 . They were still not accustomed to the leading and guidance of the indwelling Spirit Rom 8:14 as the apostle Paul was later in 16:6-8.
[42]  We have seen that the subject of Acts is the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension, by the Spirit, through the disciples, for the producing of the churches the kingdom of God.
[43]  Pentecost was the fulfillment of the feast of Weeks, and this feast was also called the feast of Harvest Exo 23:16 .
[44]  Concerning the sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest, Leviticus 23:10 and 11 say, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
[45]  The New Testament reveals that the Triune God became incarnate.
[46]  This means that the One who was incarnated was the complete God, the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, not merely the Son.
[47]  During the summer training in 1963, I asked a brother to read to the trainees an article from a certain charismatic magazine.
[48]  The writer of that article said that he had contacted two hundred people who claimed to speak in tongues.
[49]  After Peter saw the vision concerning the Lord Jesus being the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 , the Lord said to him, I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in the heavens v. 19 . According to history, the keys have been two.
[50]  The pouring out of the Spirit after Christ s ascension was the descension of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit to carry out His heavenly ministry on earth to build up His church Matt 16:18 as His Body Eph 1:23 for God s New Testament economy.
[51]  Joel s prophecy and its fulfillment for God s New Testament jubilee have two aspects: on God s side, He poured out His Spirit in the ascension of the resurrected Christ; on our side, we call on the name of the ascended Lord who has accomplished all, attained unto all, and obtained all.
[52]  In Peter s first message to the Jews 2:14-47 we see four matters: the explaining of the economical filling of the Holy Spirit vv.
[53]  In 2:24-32 Peter speaks concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
[54]  Acts 2:33 says, Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you both see and hear.
[55]  This is not the promise given by the Lord in John 14:16-17 and 15:26, but the promise given by the Father in Joel 2:28, quoted by Peter in Acts 2:17, and referred to by the Lord in Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:4, concerning the Holy Spirit.
[56]  After His resurrection and ascension, He still needed to receive the Spirit economically again so that He might pour Himself out upon His Body to carry out on earth His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of God s New Testament economy.
[57]  This indicates that after Christ s ascension God still works to defeat Christ s enemies so that He may come back to reign in the universal kingdom of God 1 Cor 15:25; Rev 11:15 .
[58]  In verse 36 Peter declares, Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified.
[59]  Jesus was made the Lord to possess all, and He was made the Christ to carry out God s commission.
[60]  Peter also instructed the Spirit-moved ones to be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.
[61]  After the Lord Jesus accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God.
[62]  Because the death of Christ is included in Christ and because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, who is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side, to terminate their old life, and on the positive side to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ.
[63]  According to Acts 2:38, baptism upon the name of Jesus Christ was for the forgiveness of sins.
[64]  Forgiveness of sins is based upon the redemption of Christ accomplished through His death 10:43; Eph 1:7; 1 Cor 15:3 .
[65]  It is the initial and basic blessing of God s full salvation.
[66]  Based upon it, the blessing of God s full salvation goes forth and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[67]  The gift of the Holy Spirit is not any gift distributed by the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 12:6, 1 Corinthians 12:4, and 1 Peter 4:10; rather, it is the gift which is the Holy Spirit Himself, given by God to the believers in Christ as the unique gift that produces all the gifts mentioned in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and 1 Peter 4.
[68]  This crooked generation refers to the perverted Jews in this age who rejected God s Christ v. 36 and were considered by God as the present evil age Gal 1:4 . For the crooked Jews to be saved from their present evil age requires a genuine repentance of their crookedness toward God and a real turn to God.
[69]  Just as the teaching of the apostles is unique, so the fellowship of the apostles also is unique.
[70]  This fellowship is mentioned in 1 John 1:3: That which we have seen and heard we report also to you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[71]  Hence, to have fellowship with the apostles, to be in the fellowship of the apostles, and to have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles fellowship, is to put away our private interests and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God s purpose.
[72]  In 3:15 Peter went on to say, And the Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
[73]  This may indicate that Peter did not have a clear vision concerning the church age in God s New Testament economy, as the entire New Testament reveals, that is, that before the seasons of refreshing, the church occupies a considerable period of time in God s dispensation.
[74]  If we read Acts 3 in this way, we shall see that the Lord is the Servant of God, the Holy One, the Righteous One, and the Author of life.
[75]  In 3:22 and 23 Peter points out that the Lord Jesus is a Prophet: Moses indeed said, A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up for you, from your brothers, like me; Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He may speak to you.
[76]  And it shall be that every soul, whoever does not hear that Prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
[77]  As the Prophet, Christ speaks for God, and He speaks forth God.
[78]  In 3:25 we see that the Lord Jesus is also the seed of Abraham: You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God covenanted with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
[79]  This was a gathering of the Jewish Sanhedrin v. 15 . It was this Sanhedrin composed of the Jewish leaders that became the strongest opponent of the Lord Jesus and His ministry in the four Gospels and condemned Him to death Matt 26:59 . Now it was the same Sanhedrin with its constituents that began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry in Acts 5:21; 6:12; 22:30 . This indicates that Judaism had fallen into the hand of God s enemy, Satan, the Devil, and was being used by him to frustrate and attempt to destroy God s move in His New Testament economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose, which is to bring His kingdom to the earth by the establishing and building up of the churches through the preaching of the gospel of Christ.
[80]  Verses 8 through 10 say, Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders, if we today are being examined regarding a good deed done to a sick man, by what means this man has been healed, let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you well.
[81]  The Lord Jesus also quoted this verse in Matthew 21:42, where He was indicating that He is the stone for God s building Isa 28:16; Zech 3:9; 1 Pet 2:4 , and the builders were the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God s building.
[82]  The crucial point in Acts 4 concerns Christ the Healer revealed in chapter three.
[83]  The healing recorded in Acts 3 did not take place outside the holy city; it happened not only in the city but on the premises of the temple.
[84]  In our reading of the book of Acts we may still be under the influence of traditional theology.
[85]  Due to this influence, we may realize only that the name of Jesus is for salvation, that there is no other name given for us to be saved.
[86]  In chapter three of Acts Peter presents Christ, the Healer, as God s Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed in whom all families of the earth will be blessed.
[87]  SAVED IN THE NAME OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE ONE
[88]  When some hear that we say according to the Scriptures that Christ is the cornerstone, the foundation stone, the topstone, and even all the stones in God s building, they may accuse us of teaching pantheism.
[89]  This was practiced for a short time at the initiation of God s New Testament economy; it did not continue for the long run as a practice of legality in the church life during Paul s ministry.
[90]  But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to the Holy Spirit and put aside for yourself some of the proceeds of the land? v. 3 . Ananias lied apparently to the apostles but actually to the Holy Spirit, who is God v. 4 , because the Spirit and the apostles were one.
[91]  Satan is not far from us, and we need to be careful lest we be deceived by him.
[92]  If we would avoid Satan s deception, we must reject, condemn, and abandon the ambition to be somebody in the church life.
[93]  This section of Acts covers four matters: the Sanhedrin s arrest of the apostles and the Lord s rescue vv.
[94]  In verses 29 through 31 Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men.
[95]  The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you slew, hanging Him on a tree.
[96]  Jesus incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader that He might be the Savior.
[97]  According to Peter s word in 5:31, the Lord is the Leader and the Savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
[98]  To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God s chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior.
[99]  His sovereign ruling causes and leads God s chosen people to repent, and His salvation based upon His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins.
[100]  In 6:1-6 we have the appointment of seven serving ones, and in verse 7 we see the growth of the word of God and the multiplication of the disciples.
[101]  In Acts 6 the apostles encountered a problem related to language and race.
[102]  Acts 6:2 says, And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples to them, said, It is not fitting for us to leave the word of God to serve tables.
[103]  Of the seven who were selected as deacons, two Stephen and Philip had particular gifts.
[104]  From Stephen s speaking in chapter seven we can realize that he was a great teacher.
[105]  His long speech indicates that he was knowledgeable in God s Word.
[106]  According to verse 14, the opposers accused Stephen of saying that Jesus would destroy the temple and change the customs delivered by Moses.
[107]  This indicates that there must have been words circulating among the believers concerning the destruction of the temple, as prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 23:37-39 and 24:2, and words concerning the termination of the dispensation of law, as spoken by the Lord in Matthew 11:13.
[108]  The opposing Jews twisted the believers words, as they did in Matthew 27:40 regarding the Lord s word in John 2:19 when they crucified Him.
[109]  This offended the Jews by touching the traditions they had inherited for generations and stirred up their opposition, which began with the Lord s ministry in the Gospels and grew more fierce toward the apostles ministry in the Acts, during which the Lord s New Testament move was passing through a transitional period.
[110]  They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be against God s dispensational administration and would be a great damage to God s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ.
[111]  Concerning the need for a transition from the old dispensation to the new, we do not care merely for Bible knowledge but for the application to today s situation.
[112]  Not only have the Old Testament things been made into a traditional religion; even the things of the New Testament have been used in a traditional way.
[113]  Even before the end of the first century, Christians began to make the things of God s New Testament economy into a religious tradition.
[114]  I believe that if those in Catholicism and in the denominations would visit a Lord s table meeting in the church and were honest about what they observed, they would admit that among us there is something real of the New Testament economy of God.
[115]  In Acts 7:14 and 15 Stephen speaks of Jacob s going down into Egypt: Joseph sent and called for Jacob his father and all his relatives seventy-five souls in all.
[116]  And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he ended his days, he and our fathers.
[117]  In verse 51 Stephen spoke a very strong word to the opposers: You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, you also do!
[118]  Since Stephen was full of the Spirit v. 55 and was one with the Lord the Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , to resist him was to resist the Holy Spirit.
[119]  Hence, the Lord indicated to Saul, one of his persecutors Acts 7:58; 8:1 , that he was persecuting Him 9:4 .
[120]  It was sovereign of God that the scattering of the believers from Jerusalem to other localities through the persecution should carry out the spreading of the gospel for the fulfillment of the Lord s word in 1:8 see 11:19 .
[121]  PHILIP S PREACHING IN THE CITY OF SAMARIA Manifested to Be an Evangelist
[122]  Acts 8:5 says, And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
[123]  This Philip was not the Philip among the apostles 1:13 , but the Philip among the seven appointed by the apostles to serve tables 6:5 .
[124]  Philip s preaching Christ in Samaria was a further step in the Lord s evangelical move.
[125]  Acts 8:14-16 says, Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who went down and prayed for them so that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
[126]  We need to learn from the pattern presented here not to be independent of the Body in our gospel work.
[127]  In 8:9-13 we see that a man named Simon, who practiced magic in the city of Samaria, believed in the Lord and was baptized.
[128]  When he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this authority, that on whomever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit vv.
[129]  In the case of Philip preaching the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch, we also have the matter of water baptism in 8:26-40.
[130]  Here in Acts 8 we have the case of a genuine Gentile believing in the Lord.
[131]  From Isaiah 53 Philip brought the good news of Jesus to him v. 35 . Then as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch says, Look, water! What prevents me from being baptized? v. 36 . The fact that the Ethiopian eunuch had such a reaction when seeing water indicates that Philip in his gospel preaching should have spoken to him about water baptism.
[132]  It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God, into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule John 3:3, 5 , so that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom.
[133]  The Significance and Issue of Water Baptism The Triune God
[134]  First, this water signifies the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God.
[135]  In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[136]  Therefore, when we baptize believers, we must baptize them not only into water, but also into the Triune God.
[137]  Acts 9:1 says, But Saul, still breathing threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest.
[138]  Saul was probably very happy as he was on his way to Damascus.
[139]  By this he began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person the wonderful Me. This must have impressed him and affected him for his future ministry concerning Christ and the church as the great mystery of God Eph 5:32 , and laid a solid foundation for his unique ministry.
[140]  CONFIRMED THROUGH ANANIAS Identified with the Body of Christ
[141]  In 9:10-19 we see that Saul s conversion was confirmed through Ananias.
[142]  Verses 10 and 11 say, Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias!
[143]  In this message we shall continue to consider the conversion of Saul 9:1-19 .
[144]  Immediately after Saul was saved, the Lord began to educate him concerning the Body.
[145]  When the Lord told Ananias to seek Saul, Ananias replied, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem v. 13 . Here we see that Ananias did not want to have anything to do with Saul.
[146]  In Acts 9 we see that the leading persecutor and foremost opponent of Jesus was saved and became a vessel.
[147]  As a member of the Body, he was qualified to receive the heavenly commission to complete the word of God s New Testament revelation.
[148]  LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN THE CONVERSION OF SAUL 3 Scripture Reading: Acts 9:20-30 IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMING THIS ONE
[149]  Probably no one has ever turned to the Lord Jesus more quickly than Saul of Tarsus did.
[150]  After Saul was baptized, he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days 9:19 .
[151]  Verse 20 says, And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that this One is the Son of God.
[152]  According to 9:22, Saul proved to the Jews in Damascus that this One is the Christ.
[153]  The title the Christ denotes the Lord s commission, that is, the Lord s work.
[154]  Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . The revelation given to Peter includes the two aspects of the Lord Jesus, the aspects of His Person and His commission.
[155]  Mistaken Beliefs concerning Christ s Humanity Denying That the Ascended Christ
[156]  Some Christians today may not believe properly in the humanity of the Lord Jesus.
[157]  Many years ago, a certain person told me that he did not believe that the Lord Jesus, as the One in the heavens, still possesses the human nature.
[158]  The high priest was inquiring if the Lord Jesus was the Son of God v. 63 . In His answer the Lord acknowledged that He is the Son of God, but He went on to say that in His ascension and at His coming back on the clouds He will be the Son of Man.
[159]  THE SPREAD OF PETER S MINISTRY To Lydda, Healing Aeneas
[160]  Some readers of Acts may think that by the time of chapter nine, when Saul of Tarsus came into the Lord s testing, Peter has moved out of the scene.
[161]  However, in 9:32-43 we see that Peter is still in the scene, and these verses describe the spread of Peter s ministry.
[162]  While he was in Lydda, Peter healed a certain man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been lying on a bed, for he was paralyzed v. 33 . Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Rise up and make your own bed! Immediately Aeneas rose up, and all those dwelling in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord vv.
[163]  Chapter one of Acts stands alone as a chapter concerned with preparation.
[164]  By the end of chapter nine the Lord had done many things to prepare the way for Peter to open the door for the Gentiles to come into the kingdom of God.
[165]  Acts 9:31 points to the success of Peter s ministry: The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.
[166]  Acts 10:3 and 4 say, He saw clearly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him, Cornelius!
[167]  And looking intently at him and becoming terrified, he said, What is it, Lord?
[168]  And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have ascended for a memorial before God.
[169]  Cornelius was one of fallen mankind, sinful and condemned before God as all others, yet God accepted his prayers and his alms, whereas Cain s He rejected Gen 4:3, 5 .
[170]  This must have been due to the fact that God, based upon Christ s eternal redemption and in view of his believing in Christ in the ensuing days, forgave him v. 43 according to His foreknowledge.
[171]  In this trance, this ecstasy, Peter beheld heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the heaven vv.
[172]  The opening of the heavens in verse 11 indicates that the Lord s evangelical move on earth is under His administration on the throne in heaven see Heb 8:1; Acts 7:56 .
[173]  He said to those in the house of Cornelius that they knew the word which God sent to the sons of Israel, bringing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ...the word which came throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed: Jesus, the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him vv.
[174]  In Acts 10:42 Peter goes on to say, And He charged us to proclaim to the people and solemnly testify that this is the One who was designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
[175]  Here we see that Christ has been designated the Judge of all mankind.
[176]  Acts 10:46 continues, For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God.
[177]  Speaking in tongues was not the unique issue of receiving the Holy Spirit economically, because the magnifying, that is, the praising of God, was also one of its issues in this case, as prophesying was also one of its issues in the case of the twelve believers in Ephesus 19:6 .
[178]  Hence, speaking in tongues is not the only evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit economically; neither is it the necessary evidence, because there is at least one case of the receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, the case of the Samaritan believers 8:15-17 , which does not mention speaking in tongues.
[179]  Besides these five cases, in many cases of conversion, such as the three thousand 2:41 , the five thousand 4:4 , the Ethiopian eunuch 8:36, 38-39a , the many who believed in Antioch 11:20-21, 24 , the many cases in chapters thirteen and fourteen under Paul s preaching ministry, Lydia in Philippi 16:14-15 , the jailer in Philippi 16:33 , the believers in Thessalonica 17:4 , the believers in Berea 17:10-12 , the believers in Athens 17:34 , the ruler of the synagogue and many other believers in Corinth 18:8 , and the believers in Ephesus 19:18-19 , there is no mention of the believers receiving the Holy Spirit economically the Holy Spirit s falling upon the believers because in all these cases the believers were brought into the Body of Christ through their believing in a normal way, and they had no particular reason for some member of the Body of Christ to bring them into the identification with the Body by the laying on of hands.
[180]  In this message we shall consider a matter that will help us to understand God s economy in the record of the New Testament.
[181]  We shall see that in God s economy certain things, in particular the baptism in the Holy Spirit, have been accomplished once for all.
[182]  The principle is the same with Christ s incarnation, resurrection, ascension, breathing of the Spirit into His disciples, and the pouring out of the Spirit upon His disciples.
[183]  It is not the case that whenever someone believes in the Lord Jesus, it is necessary for Him to breathe the Spirit into that one, or pour out the Spirit upon him.
[184]  The New Testament presents a picture of accomplished facts.
[185]  In this will, this testament, Christ s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing of the Spirit into us, ascension, and pouring out of the Spirit upon us have all been bequeathed to us.
[186]  In verses 15 through 17 Peter went on to explain that the Holy Spirit fell on those in the house of Cornelius, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit v. 16 . Then in verse 17 Peter concluded, If God therefore gave to them the equal gift as also to us, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could forbid God?
[187]  In this verse the Greek word for life is zoe, referring to the eternal life 1 John 1:2 , the life of God Eph 4:18 , the uncreated, indestructible life Heb 7:16 , which is Christ Himself John 14:6; 11:25; Col 3:4 , the very embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 , as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , of which life the Spirit is Rom 8:2 , received by the believers through their faith in Christ John 3:15-16 after repentance for their full salvation Rom 5:10 .
[188]  THE NEED FOR A DISPENSATIONAL TRANSFER A Transfer from the Old Testament Economy to the New Testament Economy
[189]  We have pointed out that Acts is a dispensational book.
[190]  The Lord replied, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in His own authority v. 7 . Then the Lord went on to say that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit had come upon them and they would be His witnesses unto the remotest part of the earth.
[191]  In 1:8 the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He would use them as His witnesses not only among the Jews in Jerusalem and in all Judea but among those in Samaria, and even among all the Gentiles in the remotest part of the earth.
[192]  According to verse 4, Peter began to explain in sequence what had taken place in the house of Cornelius.
[193]  When I read the account in 11:1-18 many years ago, I thought that Peter was quite spiritual in the way he explained the matter to those of the circumcision.
[194]  According to 11:23, when Barnabas arrived in Antioch and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart.
[195]  This grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply so that we may live in resurrection.
[196]  The grace that was seen by Barnabas must have been the Triune God received and enjoyed by the believers and expressed in their salvation, change in life, holy living, and in the gifts they exercised in their meetings, all of which could be seen by others.
[197]  Concerning Saul, God was sovereign in preparing him as another vessel to carry His New Testament economy to the Gentile world.
[198]  If we read this book carefully, we shall see that chapters two through six are a section that presents Peter s ministry for Christ s propagation.
[199]  In 10:1 11:18 Luke records the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles through Peter.
[200]  In 11:19 the record goes on to tell us that those who were scattered by the tribulation that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch.
[201]  Luke s record not only shows the tendency of the Lord s spread toward the Gentiles, but also reveals how Saul was produced as the vessel to carry out God s ministry in the Gentile world.
[202]  In the first chapters of Acts we see that the Lord used Peter very much.
[203]  Although Peter was good, the Roman Catholic Church was wrong to exalt him so highly.
[204]  Now we need to consider the reason Luke inserted a section concerning Peter.
[205]  Furthermore, Luke s narration in 12:1-24 makes Peter a hero.
[206]  There are a number of other matters in 12:1-24 that we need to consider.
[207]  First, when Peter was in prison, prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him v. 5 . This indicates that behind the scene there was a battle between spiritual forces, a battle between God and His enemy, Satan.
[208]  Apparently the conflict was between Herod and Peter; actually it was between God and His enemy.
[209]  According to 13:1, there were prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch.
[210]  Acts 13:3 continues, Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
[211]  Here we see that they fasted and prayed; we are not told that they discussed and decided.
[212]  Acts 13:4b tells us that Barnabas and Paul went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.
[213]  Barnabas and Paul did not go to attend the Jewish synagogue gathering, but to take advantage of their gathering to announce the word of God, just as the Lord did in His ministry on earth Matt 4:23; Luke 4:16 .
[214]  In this portion of Acts Paul and his companions came to Antioch of Pisidia, where they preached the crucified and resurrected Jesus Christ as the Savior vv.
[215]  A synagogue was a place where people who sought God studied the holy Scriptures.
[216]  After pointing out that the resurrected Christ was seen by those who had come up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people v. 31 , Paul went on to say, We bring to you good news of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.
[217]  We have seen that Paul went to the synagogue to speak the word of God to both the Jews and the Gentile seekers after God.
[218]  They are all the aspects of what Christ is.
[219]  Furthermore, the holy and trustworthy things include all the aspects of Christ unveiled in 1 Corinthians: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, glory, the depths of God, the unique foundation of God s building, the Passover, the unleavened bread, the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, the spiritual rock, the Head, the Body, the firstfruit, the second Man, and the last Adam.
[220]  In 13:38 and 39 Paul goes on to say, Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you, and from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.
[221]  In 13:44-52 we see that Paul and Barnabas were rejected by the Jews.
[222]  Verses 44 through 46 say, And on the coming Sabbath almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.
[223]  This is a strong proof that the totality of all that Paul preached concerning the resurrected Christ, the Son of God, the Savior, the holy and faithful things, and the grace of God is eternal life.
[224]  The apostle Paul, because he was one with Christ in carrying out God s salvation in Christ, applied this prophetic word to himself in his ministry of gospel preaching for the turning of the gospel from the Jews, because of their rejection, to the Gentiles.
[225]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 5 Scripture Reading: Acts 14:1-28 A BOOK OF GOD S ECONOMY
[226]  The apostles could testify of the word of the Lord s grace even though they had only the Old Testament.
[227]  Can we find the word of grace in the Old Testament?
[228]  What they had was the word of God s law, not the word of the Lord s grace.
[229]  TO LYSTRA AND DERBE OF LYCAONIA The Reaction of the Crowds
[230]  When the apostles became aware of a hostile intention of both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers to treat them outrageously and to stone them v. 5 , they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country; and there they were bringing the good news vv.
[231]  And he leaped up and walked v. 10 . According to verses 11 and 12, when the crowds saw what Paul did, they lifted up their voice in Lycaonian, saying, The gods have become like men and have come down to us! And they called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the leading speaker.
[232]  To establish the souls of the disciples is to establish them in their mind, that they may know and understand the Lord and the things concerning Him 1 Cor 2:16; Phil 3:10 ; in their emotion, that they may love the Lord and have a heart for the Lord s interest Mark 12:30; Rom 16:4 ; and in their will, that they may be strong to remain with the Lord and do the things that please the Lord Acts 11:23; Col 1:10; 1 Thes 4:1 .
[233]  through Many Tribulations A Kingdom of the Divine Life
[234]  In 14:22 we see that Paul and Barnabas told the disciples that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.
[235]  Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14 .
[236]  Paul may have had the thought that the kingdom of God is a realm in which God rules over His people, but this certainly was not his main thought concerning the kingdom of God.
[237]  of the Resurrected Christ as the Kingdom of God
[238]  Now that we have seen that the kingdom of God is Christ as the seed that is sown into us, develops, and consummates in a harvest, we need to ask what it means to enter into the kingdom.
[239]  To enter into the kingdom of God is to enter into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.
[240]  Throughout the centuries, other forms of religion Catholicism, Protestantism, and Islam have also been used by God s enemy to keep God s people from entering into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the kingdom of God.
[241]  In the light of what we have seen concerning the kingdom of God, let us now come back to Acts 14 and ask if the disciples whom Paul was entreating had entered into the realm of the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom of God.
[242]  Actually, the problem of this heretical teaching should have been solved by Peter and James in Jerusalem.
[243]  According to 15:2, Paul and Barnabas had no little dissension and discussion with the Judaizers.
[244]  At this point, I would like to ask a question of those who are elders in the churches today.
[245]  Suppose certain ones in the church begin to teach that the believers today should be circumcised and keep the law of Moses.
[246]  Acts 15:1-34 records the trouble caused by those who insisted that one cannot be saved without being circumcised according to the custom of Moses v. 1 . Concerning this matter a conference of the apostles and elders was held in Jerusalem vv.
[247]  Actually when this heresy concerning circumcision arose at Jerusalem in the very beginning, Peter should have exercised the gift that the Lord had given him to clear up the cloudy situation in Jerusalem concerning God s New Testament economy, according to the revelation that the Lord had given him and the other apostles in Acts 1:8 and the vision he had received at Joppa in Acts 10 concerning the Gentiles.
[248]  When Peter finished his testimony, those attending the conference were silent.
[249]  Then they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them v. 12 . Following this, we have the fellowship given by James vv.
[250]  In verses 16 and 17 James quotes from the book of Amos to show that the words of the prophets agree with taking out of the Gentiles a people for God s name: After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins, and I will erect it again, so that the rest of mankind may seek out the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom My name has been called.
[251]  At this point it is helpful to compare James use of the Old Testament with that of the Lord Jesus in Luke 4.
[252]  By citing the cases of the widow and of Naaman the Lord was indicating that God was about to set the nation of Israel aside and turn to the Gentiles.
[253]  When the Jews rejected the word of the gospel, Paul said boldly, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first; since you thrust it away and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles v. 46 . Then Paul quotes Isaiah 49:6: I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation unto the remotest part of the earth.
[254]  Acts 15:22-33 describes the solution to the problem.
[255]  In verse 26 we are told that Barnabas and Saul were men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[256]  Acts 15:40 and 41 say, But Paul, having chosen Silas, went out, being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.
[257]  The fact that Paul was commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers indicates that he, and not Barnabas, had taken the right way.
[258]  In chapter eighteen of Acts we see that he still had a Jewish vow v. 18 , a private vow that could be performed in any place by the Jews for thanksgiving, with the shearing of the hair.
[259]  Paul knew that there were Jews in all the leading cities of Asia Minor.
[260]  In this message we shall begin to consider 16:6-10, which describes how Paul and his co-workers were led of God to go forth into Macedonia, a province of the Roman Empire in southeastern Europe.
[261]  The move of the apostle Paul and his co-workers for the spread of the gospel was not according to their decision and preference, nor according to any schedule made by human council, but by the Holy Spirit according to God s counsel, as in the mission of Philip 8:29, 39 .
[262]  In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was strictly speaking not by the Spirit of God.
[263]  These two divine titles indicate strongly that Paul s move in his evangelical work was not something in the way of the old dispensation.
[264]  If it had been a move in the old dispensational way, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned.
[265]  But in Acts 16 there is no mention of the Spirit of God nor of the Spirit of Jehovah.
[266]  Instead, we are told that Paul and his co-workers were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia and were not allowed by the Spirit of Jesus to go into Bithynia.
[267]  The fact that Luke speaks of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus indicates that the evangelical work of the apostles was a new move in God s New Testament economy.
[268]  The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted.
[269]  Paul was not constituted of the Spirit of God nor of the Spirit of Jehovah but of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus.
[270]  As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord s incarnation and birth, and of the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord s humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting resurrection, and ascension.
[271]  Paul and his co-workers were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia v. 6 , and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go into Bithynia v. 7 . After they had come down to Troas, a vision was seen by Paul during the night: a certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us! v. 9 . This vision seen by Paul was neither a dream nor a trance.
[272]  Acts 16:14 goes on to say, And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods, from the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things spoken by Paul.
[273]  The Lord here, who opened the heart of Lydia to give heed to the gospel preaching, must be the Spirit, who is the Lord Himself 2 Cor 3:17 .
[274]  We do not know whether Lydia was a Jewish lady or a God-seeking Greek, since many of the Greek women, especially of the upper class, were seeking God.
[275]  In verse 30 the jailer said to Paul and Silas, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?
[276]  They replied, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household v. 31 . The word household indicates that the family of the believer is a complete unit for God s salvation, like the family of Noah Gen 7:1 , the families partaking of the Passover Exo 12:3-4 , the family of the harlot Rahab Josh 2:18-19 , the family of Zaccheus Luke 19:9 , the family of Cornelius Acts 11:14 , the family of Lydia 16:15 , the family of the jailer here, and the family of Crispus in 18:8.
[277]  Paul and Silas spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house v. 32 . Then taking them with him in that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes v. 33a . Literally, the Greek words rendered washed their stripes mean washed them from their stripes.
[278]  LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE PROPAGATION IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 12 Scripture Reading: Acts 17:1-34
[279]  In verses 1 through 9 Paul comes to Thessalonica; in verses 10 through 13, to Berea; and in verses 14 through 34, to Athens.
[280]  In 17:3 Luke indicates that Paul simply announced Christ to those in the synagogue.
[281]  Actually, Paul must have reasoned concerning Christ in a lengthy and detailed way.
[282]  I believe that he reasoned about Christ being God and man.
[283]  Christ s suffering implies His incarnation, and His incarnation implies His dual status, that is, His deity and His humanity.
[284]  Acts 17:10 says, And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas during the night to Berea, who when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
[285]  Why did the brothers immediately send Paul and Silas to Berea?
[286]  The spirit here was Paul s human spirit Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27 , regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , indwelt by the Lord the Spirit 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:10-11 , and witnessing with the Spirit Rom 8:16 , in which he worshipped and served God John 4:24; Rom 1:9 .
[287]  Acts 17:17 goes on to say of Paul, He was reasoning therefore in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshipped, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
[288]  Here we see that in the synagogue Paul reasoned with the Jews and with those who worshipped, who probably were Greeks who worshipped God.
[289]  In this message we shall study Paul s preaching on the Areopagus.
[290]  In 17:26 Paul goes on to say, And He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling.
[291]  We need to consider in detail what it means to say that all of mankind are God s offspring.
[292]  Then they reasoned that since Adam, the first of mankind, was a son of God, then all his descendants must also be sons of God.
[293]  This concept, they believe, is strengthened by Paul s word in Acts 17 concerning all of mankind being God s offspring.
[294]  In 17:29 Paul continues, Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, an engraved work of art and thought of man.
[295]  Paul s preaching in Acts 17 surely fit the situation of the Greeks in Athens.
[296]  Much of what Paul said was directed at the Epicureans and also at the Stoics.
[297]  In his preaching on the Areopagus Paul first referred to God as the Creator in an objective way as the One outside of us and with whom we do not have a direct relationship.
[298]  He preached Christ not only as the Messiah, but also as the One who was God incarnate, who possessed humanity, who lived a human life on earth for thirty three and a half years, who died an all-inclusive death in order to solve the problems between man and God, who was resurrected in order to propagate the divine life by imparting it into His believers, and who ascended to the heavens where He was made Lord and Christ.
[299]  What he did here was used by the Lord for His ministry to build up His church, just as what Caesar Augustus did was used by God for the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the birth place of Christ Luke 2:1-7 .
[300]  Acts 18:4 says that Paul was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.
[301]  Paul, of course, went to the Jewish synagogue gathering for the purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity to announce the word of God.
[302]  Acts 18:18 says, But Paul, having remained there yet a considerable number of days, took leave of the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
[303]  This was a private vow performed in any place by the Jews for thanksgiving, with the shearing of the hair.
[304]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 15 Scripture Reading: Acts 18:5, 11; 9:11, 22; 13:5; 14:1; 17:1-3 PAUL S WAY OF PREACHING
[305]  The main thing we need to see in chapter eighteen of Acts is Paul s way of preaching.
[306]  According to 18:5, when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was wholly occupied in the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
[307]  When he took leave of them he said, I will come back to you again, God willing v. 21 . As we shall see, on his third ministry journey 18:23 21:17 , Paul returned to Ephesus and stayed there for three years 18:24 19:41 .
[308]  It is the way God dispenses Himself into the believers through Christ s redemption and the Spirit s anointing; it is the way the believers partake of God and enjoy God; it is the way the believers worship God in their spirit by enjoying Him and follow the persecuted Jesus by being one with Him; and it is the way the believers are brought into the church and built up into the Body of Christ to bear the testimony of Jesus.
[309]  We can see from the record in Acts 18 that Apollos was very good.
[310]  Not only was he pious and godly like Gamaliel; he also knew the way of the Lord.
[311]  However, although Apollos knew the Lord s way, he did not know God s economy in full.
[312]  The Lord s New Testament way had been in practice for many years, but Apollos did not know God s economy further than the ministry of John the Baptist.
[313]  When the disciples heard Paul s word, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus v. 5 . To be baptized into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 , or into the name of the Lord Jesus Acts 8:16; Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27 , is to be baptized into a spiritual union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[314]  To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is to be baptized into the Person of the Lord, to be identified with the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, to be put into an organic union with the living Lord.
[315]  LIFE STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE THE PROPAGATION
[316]  At a time when Paul was in a very difficult situation and also had an excellent opportunity to carry out God s New Testament economy, he purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem.
[317]  Although he was very much occupied with his work in Ephesus, his spirit was burdened for Jerusalem.
[318]  If we read Romans 15:25-31, we shall see that Paul was burdened to bring financial help from the churches in Macedonia and Achaia to the poor saints in Judea.
[319]  If we study the book of Acts and all of Paul s Epistles, we shall have a clear view of the Lord s move on earth in His New Testament economy.
[320]  In his ministry Paul was constantly fighting against the power of darkness.
[321]  As we have pointed out, the power of darkness was behind the idol worship in Ephesus.
[322]  According to 20:5 and 6, Paul and his companions came to Troas, where they stayed seven days.
[323]  And on the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, about to go forth on the next day, and prolonged his message until midnight v. 7 . The first day of the week was the Lord s day Rev 1:10 . Paul stayed in Troas for seven days, but it was only on the first day of the week that they gathered together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord.
[324]  This indicates that at that time the apostle and the church considered the first day of the week a day to meet together for the Lord.
[325]  From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church v. 17 . When they came to him, he said, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears and trials which came upon me by the plots of the Jews; how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house vv.
[326]  Let us consider 20:22 again along with verse 23: And now, behold, I am going bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what I will meet with there, except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
[327]  Paul did not know what he would meet with in Jerusalem, but he knew one thing, that the Holy Spirit solemnly testified to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him.
[328]  The Holy Spirit s testifying was only a prophecy, a foretelling, not a charge.
[329]  In verse 24 Paul continues, But I consider my life of no account as if it were precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify the gospel of the grace of God.
[330]  Paul s word here is related to the Lord s New Testament move in propagating the resurrected Christ through the gospel.
[331]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 20 Scripture Reading: Acts 20:13-38 THE CHURCH
[332]  In 20:28 Paul charges the elders of the church in Ephesus to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.
[333]  The blood that has redeemed fallen human beings is the blood of Jesus, the Son of God.
[334]  The name Jesus denotes the Lord s humanity, which was needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title His Son denotes the Lord s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood.
[335]  Although we have always believed and taught that the God-man, Jesus Christ, is one person with the divine nature and the human nature and that He is both the complete God and a perfect man, certain opposers have falsely accused us of teaching that Christ was neither fully God nor fully man.
[336]  Since we have pointed out that the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the God-man, some may wonder about Mark 15:34: At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?
[337]  This was the Lord s cry during the time He was bearing our sins 1 Pet 2:24 , being made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 , and taking the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 .
[338]  Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit and was born of God and with God, He had the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His divine being.
[339]  In this message we shall continue to consider Paul s charge to the elders in Ephesus recorded in 20:13-38.
[340]  In verse 29, Paul did not care for his own life, but he was very much concerned for the future of the church, which was a treasure to him as well as to God.
[341]  In verses 31 and 32 Paul continues, Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears.
[342]  And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.
[343]  Here Paul commits the believers to God and to the word of His grace.
[344]  I believe that during the three years Paul was in Ephesus, he daily spoke the word of God s grace to the saints.
[345]  In 20:33 and 34 Paul went on to say, I have coveted no one s silver or gold or clothing.
[346]  After Paul s solemn and precious fellowship with the elders of the church in Ephesus 20:13-35 , he knelt down with them all and prayed 20:36 .
[347]  And having sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days; and they told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem v. 4 . In 20:23 the Holy Spirit made known to Paul that bonds and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem.
[348]  THE INFLUENCE OF JUDAISM A Mixture of God s New Testament Economy
[349]  According to 21:17, when Paul and his company came to Jerusalem, the brothers gladly welcomed them.
[350]  After Paul greeted the elders, he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry v. 19 . Paul wisely did not teach them, but instead presented the things God had done through his ministry.
[351]  Referring to the thousands of Jews who believed and were zealous for the law, James went on to say to Paul, And they have been instructed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs v. 21 . To leave the law of Moses, not to circumcise, and not to walk according to the customs of dead letters are really according to God s New Testament economy.
[352]  But these were considered by the unbelieving Jews and even by the Jewish believers in Christ to be apostasy from God s Old Testament dispensation.
[353]  On the other hand, they pointed out to Paul that in Jerusalem thousands of Jews believed and were zealous for the law v. 20 . Furthermore, these believing Jews had been instructed concerning Paul that he taught apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs v. 21 . James and the elders went on to make the following requirement of Paul: Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law vv.
[354]  It is very difficult to believe that Paul would be purified, enter into the temple, and wait for the offerings to be offered by the priest.
[355]  He did this after writing the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, books that were written not long before he came to Jerusalem.
[356]  Although it is difficult to believe that Paul carried out the word of James and the elders, it is a fact that he joined himself to the Nazarites and went with them into the temple.
[357]  The Lord knew what was in Paul s heart.
[358]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 24 Scripture Reading: Acts 21:18-39 A SUMMARY OF THE REVELATION IN THE BIBLE
[359]  The Bible reveals that God had an eternal plan and that this plan eventually became His economy.
[360]  God s plan is accomplished through Christ s incarnation, human living, and all-inclusive death to terminate everything of the old creation so that He may germinate His chosen people in resurrection.
[361]  In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 so that He may propagate Himself as the processed Triune God to produce the Body.
[362]  If James concept had been widely accepted in Asia Minor and Europe, how could there have been one Body for Christ in a practical way?
[363]  Would there be two kinds of churches a Judaic church for the Jewish believers and a Gentile church for the Gentile believers?
[364]  Who among your Christian friends knows God s New Testament economy to propagate the resurrected Christ and to impart this Christ into the believers so that they may be living members to form Christ s Body in this age in order to express the Triune God?
[365]  He is today s Moses, imparting the law of life into His believers, and also today s Elijah, speaking for God and speaking forth God within His believers.
[366]  In Matthew 28:19-20a the resurrected Christ said to His disciples, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you.
[367]  It seems that when Paul went to Jerusalem the last time, he did not have the opportunity to help matters there.
[368]  In Hebrews we see that Christ is far superior to everything in Judaism.
[369]  According to Hebrews 1, Christ is the very God.
[370]  In the book of Ephesians Paul indicates that all the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see God s calling, which issues in the church, Christ s Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all 1:17-23 .
[371]  In chapter three we see that the riches of Christ need to become the constituent of the church life, and that we need Christ to make His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God to become His full expression vv.
[372]  The Body is constituted of and mingled with the Triune God to become the new man v. 24 . Following this, in chapter five Paul indicates that the new man should be filled in the spirit with the Triune God in order to have a life that is the expression of the Triune God in Christ v. 18 . Finally, in Ephesians 6 we see that we must fight a spiritual battle for the kingdom of God v. 11 . This is a brief summary of the revelation in Ephesians.
[373]  In this message we shall see that Paul was seized by the Jews in Jerusalem 21:27-30 , that the Roman commander intervened 21:31-39 , and that Paul was given the opportunity to defend himself before the rioting Jews 21:40 22:21 .
[374]  Yes, God s New Testament teaching according to His New Testament economy is really against the Jews who oppose God s New Testament economy Matt 21:41, 43-45; 22:7; 23:32-36; Acts 7:51; 13:40-41 , against the law of dead letters Rom 3:20, 28; 6:14; 7:4, 6; Gal 2:19, 21; 5:4 , and against the holy place, the temple Matt 23:38; 24:2; Acts 7:48 .
[375]  DEFENDING HIMSELF BEFORE THE RIOTING JEWS Paul s Need to Make a Defense
[376]  Paul asked permission of the Roman commander to speak to the people v. 39 . When the commander had given him permission, Paul addressed the people in the Hebrew dialect.
[377]  Verses 12 and 13 continue, And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well attested by all the Jews dwelling there, came to me, and standing by said to me, Saul, brother, receive your sight!
[378]  We know from 9:11-17 that the Lord sent Ananias, one member of His Body, to Paul so that he might be initiated into the identification with His Body.
[379]  According to 22:14-16 Ananias said to Paul, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice of His mouth; for you will be a witness to Him unto all men of the things which you have seen and heard.
[380]  In order to wash away his sins in persecuting and arresting the Lord s callers, not only before God but also before all the believers, Ananias charged him to do the same calling, which he had condemned, at his baptism, a public confession of the Lord whom he had persecuted.
[381]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 27 Scripture Reading: Acts 22:1-21 PAUL S BAPTISM
[382]  To believe is to receive the Lord John 1:12 not only for forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 , but also for regeneration 1 Pet 1:21, 23 , so that those who believe may become the children of God John 1:12-13 and the members of Christ Eph 5:30 in an organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 .
[383]  In 22:16 Ananias told Paul to rise up, be baptized, and wash away his sins.
[384]  I am concerned about those who are troubled by our emphasis on calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.
[385]  It is not correct to say that we stress this too much.
[386]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 28 Scripture Reading: Acts 22:30 23:35 DEFENDING HIMSELF BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN
[387]  Acts 23:11 says, But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified concerning Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.
[388]  The Lord was living all the time in Paul essentially Gal 2:20 .
[389]  The Lord s word in 23:11 about Paul solemnly testifying concerning Him in Jerusalem indicates that the Lord admitted that the apostle had borne a solemn testimony concerning Him in Jerusalem.
[390]  What the ascended Christ wanted to use to carry out His heavenly ministry for the propagating of Himself so that the kingdom of God might be established for the building up of the churches for His fullness was not a group of preachers trained by man s teaching to do a preaching work, but a body of His witnesses, martyrs, who bore a living testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ.
[391]  In His ascension He carries out His ministry in the heavens, as recorded in Acts, through witnesses in His resurrection life and with His ascension power and authority to spread Himself as the development of the kingdom of God from Jerusalem unto the remotest part of the earth, as the consummation of His ministry in the New Testament.
[392]  In 24:15 Paul speaks of the resurrection: Having hope toward God, which these themselves also look for, that there is about to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.
[393]  Acts 24:22 and 23 say, But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned the case, saying, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will determine your affairs.
[394]  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 30 Scripture Reading: Acts 24:22-27; Gal 1:17; Col 1:25; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 2 Tim 1:14; 2:2, 22
[395]  According to Acts 24:27, the Lord set aside a two-year period in which Paul was kept in custody in Caesarea.
[396]  In these years Paul must have thought about what had taken place in Acts 15 and 21.
[397]  In Acts 21 we see the weakness of Paul in facing the religious mixture in Jerusalem.
[398]  Although Peter and John were with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration, they were silent concerning God s New Testament economy in Acts 21.
[399]  Paul was heavily burdened concerning God s New Testament economy.
[400]  In Colossians 1:25 he says, I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.
[401]  Here we see that Paul s writing of the book of Colossians was for the completing of God s New Testament economy.
[402]  In 1 Corinthians 10:32 Paul speaks of the Jews, the Greeks, and the church of God.
[403]  According to history, the James of Acts 21 was martyred at the hands of the opposing Jews.
[404]  By the Lord s sovereignty Paul was rescued from the hand of the rioting Jews into the hand of the Roman commander 21:27-39 .
[405]  After Paul defended himself before the Jews 21:40 22:21 , was bound by the Romans 22:22-29 , and defended himself before the Sanhedrin 22:30 23:10 , he was encouraged by the Lord.
[406]  In the foregoing message we considered Paul s situation in relation to that of the Jewish religion, Roman politics, and the church life.
[407]  In dealing with Paul, Festus was a fox and proposed that Paul go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before Festus.
[408]  Regarding this, 25:9 says, But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?
[409]  In 25:13-27 Paul s case is referred to King Agrippa.
[410]  In Philippians 3 we see that Paul counted as refuse all the things of Judaism.
[411]  Although Paul was a Hebrew of Hebrews and as to the law, a Pharisee v. 5 , he could testify, What things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.
[412]  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ vv.
[413]  What kind of messages on the book of Ephesians did you hear before you came into the Lord s recovery?
[414]  In this message we shall begin to consider Paul s defense before Agrippa and Agrippa s judgment 26:1-32 .
[415]  After Agrippa told Paul that he was permitted to speak for himself, Paul stretched out his hand and began to make his defense, saying, Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today; especially since you are an expert in all the customs and questions among the Jews; wherefore I beg you to listen to me patiently vv.
[416]  In 26:9 through 11 Paul admitted to Agrippa that he did many things contrary to the name of Jesus: I therefore thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene; which also I did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints I shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were being done away with, I cast a vote against them.
[417]  A WITNESS OF THE THINGS IN WHICH WE SEE CHRIST
[418]  In verse 16 the Lord Jesus said to Paul, I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me, and the things in which I will appear to you.
[419]  Here Paul is saying that the Lord had appointed him a minister and a witness of the things He revealed to Paul and of the things He would reveal to him.
[420]  In verse 18 we have the contents of Paul s commission: To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. Here the opening of people s eyes is the carrying out of the fulfillment of God s jubilee, the acceptable year of the Lord, proclaimed by the Lord Jesus in Luke 4:18-21 according to God s New Testament economy.
[421]  In 26:18 we see that when our eyes are opened and we have a turn, a transfer, from darkness and satanic authority to light and God, we may receive forgiveness of sins.
[422]  In 26:19 and 20 Paul testified, Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared first to those in Damascus and also in Jerusalem and all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
[423]  Paul s use of the word vision in verse 19 indicates that Paul was obedient not to doctrine, theory, religious creed, or theology, but to the heavenly vision, in which he saw the divine things concerning the Triune God to be dispensed into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people.
[424]  In chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight of Acts Luke gives us a long narration of Paul s voyage from Caesarea to Rome.
[425]  Let us now consider some of the details recorded in 27:1-44.
[426]  Acts 27:1 says, And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan cohort.
[427]  TO ROME, ENDING THE FOURTH JOURNEY Through Syracuse, Rhegium,
[428]  Acts 28:11 says, And after three months, we put out to sea in an Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island, with the twin sons of Zeus for its figurehead.
[429]  LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO A CONCLUDING WORD Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8; 27:20-26, 33-37; 28:15-16, 23-31; Phil 1:19-21a; Eph 2:14-18; Phil 3:2-8; Col 3:10-11; Heb 1:1-3; 9:12; 10:9-10, 12, 14; 13:13
[430]  The first concerns Paul s living as portrayed in Acts 27 and 28; the second concerns the revelation in the four Epistles of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews.
[431]  Paul s living as presented in these two chapters of Acts reminds us of his word written while he was imprisoned in Rome: I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death; for to me to live is Christ Phil 1:19-21a .
[432]  In Ephesians 2:14 and 15 Paul says, He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.
[433]  I believe that what Paul saw and experienced in Acts 15 through 28 caused him to write such a strong word.
[434]  In Colossians 3:10 and 11 Paul says, And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.
[435]  Here we see not only that there is no natural person in the new man but that there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person.
