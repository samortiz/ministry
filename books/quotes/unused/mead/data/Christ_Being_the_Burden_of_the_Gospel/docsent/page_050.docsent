   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Psychological Aspects of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only does our body argue for the existence of God, but our heart does as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul says, That which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them Rom 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These words clearly point to an experience within man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The existence of God is supported by the tendencies in man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For every inward need in man, there is a corresponding supply outside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, the appetite for food within man is met by the supply of a variety of foods outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the beginning of human existence, man has engaged in a search to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This tendency to seek God proves that there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even those who deny God with their words will call on God spontaneously when they are weak, when they face insurmountable obstacles, or when they are physically weak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They spontaneously seek God because in their hearts they know that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Power, position, wealth, knowledge, and pleasures cannot satisfy man s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only true satisfaction for man is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spiritual needs cannot be satisfied with material things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A person who is spiritually hungry will be satisfied only when he receives God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man needs fresh air, and he will be satisfied when he breathes fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man also needs God, and he will be satisfied when he contacts God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our conscience testifies of this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some are willing to say that there is no God because they do not feel an immediate need for God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a common situation among young people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sooner or later, however, we are all confronted with our need for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may not feel a need for God when we are young, but we will feel a need when we get older.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone who is young and strong can have a hard heart that fools him into thinking that he does not need God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day, however, when he realizes his limitations and weaknesses, he will realize his need for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Often, saying that there is no God reflects only a temporary state of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more that one says that there is no God, the weaker and more fearful he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In contrast, the more one says that there is a God, the stronger and more powerful he becomes, because God has both strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>People who have God are quite bold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Generally speaking, a twenty-year-old may say that there is God, but his assertion may not be very bold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he reaches the age of thirty, he will be much bolder, and as each year passes, he will become bolder and bolder.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he reaches fifty to sixty years of age, his speaking about God will be loud and quite forceful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In contrast, one who says that there is no God is quite forceful in his speaking when he is twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he reaches the age of thirty, he will still have some strength to deny God s existence, but as each year passes, he will be less and less bold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he reaches fifty to sixty years of age, he will begin to be afraid and to wonder if God truly does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will also begin to worry about what will happen to him if God does exist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two examples are related to the testimony of man s conscience concerning the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was once a father and a son who were atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day the father was feeling quite sick, and his heart began to soften toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sensing this, his son asked him to hold on more firmly to his atheistic belief, but the father answered, What can I hold on to?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no strength in holding on to such a belief.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is another example of man s conscience testifying that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The universe and the human body are strong arguments for the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, our conscience also testifies that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Dear friends, there is proof all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why are you still hesitating?</S>
