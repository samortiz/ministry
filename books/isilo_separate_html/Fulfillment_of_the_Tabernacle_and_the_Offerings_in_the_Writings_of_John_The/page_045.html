We may have read chapter three of John again and again without paying attention to the brass serpent in verse 14. The brass serpent typifies Christ in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says that Christ was made sin for us. Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin. But many Christians do not have any realization of what it means for Christ to be in the form of the flesh of sin.<p>Christ was a complete Substitute for us. Because we, as fallen people, are serpentine, it was necessary for Christ to have the form of a serpent but not its nature.<p>In a previous message we pointed out that John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God. This expression was used by John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus. In John 3:14 the Lord Himself indicates that He was typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses. The Lamb of God fulfills God&#8217;s requirements. All the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory were fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God without blemish. Nevertheless, in order to be our Substitute it was not sufficient for Christ to be only the Lamb of God; it was also necessary for Him to be the brass serpent.<p>There are two aspects concerning Christ as the sin offering. The first is that the sin offering must fulfill all the requirements of God, the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. This aspect of the sin offering is fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God. The second aspect of the sin offering is that this offering must also be our substitute. We are sinners and also serpents, the offspring of vipers. For this reason, it was necessary for Christ our Substitute to have the likeness of the flesh of sin typified by the form, the likeness, of a serpent. This aspect of the sin offering is fulfilled by Christ as typified by the brass serpent.<p>Christ did not have the sinful nature. If He had had the sinful nature, then He also would have needed a substitute, for He would not have been qualified to be our Substitute. But although Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin, He did not have the sinful nature. He was in the form of a sinner, but He did not have sin in His human nature. If Christ did not have the likeness of the flesh of sin, the form of a sinner, He could not have been our Substitute.<p>Regarding the sin offering, we have the aspect of the Lamb of God and also the aspect of the brass serpent. On the one hand, Christ fulfilled the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory and thereby accomplished redemption for us. On the other hand, as typified by the brass serpent, He died on the cross as our Substitute. He is both the Lamb of God and the brass serpent. However, not many of today&#8217;s Christians have the proper realization concerning this matter.<h2 class=head2>The Human Spirit</h2><p>John 3:6b says, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; Here we have another matter concerning which many Christians have very little realization. This matter is the spirit. Often I have heard people say that before they came in contact with the Lord&#8217;s recovery, they did not know that they had a human spirit. Many Christians do not know that human beings have a spirit. Christians may talk about regeneration, but in their talk some may not apply John 3:6. This indicates that they do not know in what part of their being regeneration takes place. The realization that regeneration takes place in the human spirit is very much lacking among today&#8217;s believers. In fact, many hold to the concept that the spirit and the soul are synonymous terms. But the Scriptures reveal clearly that our spirit is different from our soul. If someone does not have the proper realization regarding the human spirit as our spiritual human being, it is difficult for him to understand the matter of regeneration.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
