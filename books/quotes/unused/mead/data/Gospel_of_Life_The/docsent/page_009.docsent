   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst, 4 They said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What then do you say?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 But they said this to tempt Him, so that they might have reason to accuse Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Jesus stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>7 But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8 And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>9 And when they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood where she was, in the midst.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>10 And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Has no one condemned you?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>11 And she said, No one, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>12 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>13 The Pharisees then said to Him, You are testifying concerning Yourself; Your testimony is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>14 Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>15 You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>16 But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me. 17 And in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true: 18 I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me. 19 They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>20 These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>21 He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where I am going, you cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>22 The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>23 And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>24 Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>25 They said then to Him, Who are You?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>26 I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>27 They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>28 Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>29 And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>30 As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples; 32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>33 They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How is it that You say, You shall become free?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>34 Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>35 And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>36 If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>37 I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>38 I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>39 They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>40 But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>41 You do the works of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>42 Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me. 43 Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>44 You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>45 But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me. 46 Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? 47 He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>48 The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>49 Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. 50 But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks glory for Me and judges.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>51 Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>52 The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>53 Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The prophets died too.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Who are You making Yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>54 Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>55 Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>56 Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>57 The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>59 So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple.</S>
