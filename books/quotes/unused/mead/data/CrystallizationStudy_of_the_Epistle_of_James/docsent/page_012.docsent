   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Probably the Cultivation of Man's Natural "Bright Virtue" Created by God,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus Becoming the Cultivation of Man's Self</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bright virtue is a particular term used by Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The highest point of his teaching is to develop the "bright virtue," which is the conscience of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, what James mentions is very close to Confucius's teaching, and that teaching is to develop, to promote, the conscience, the bright virtue, by the natural man, the self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What James says is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The virtues of his perfection are not produced by God as our supply but are produced by the cultivation of the natural "bright virtue."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. The Functions of the Christian Perfection Stressed by James 1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Making Oneself Perfect in Living a Pious Life but Not in Fulfilling God's Eternal Economy</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>James stresses making oneself perfect in living a pious life but not in fulfilling God's eternal economy 1:4; 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not believe that James knew anything about God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew only how to be pious, how to be godly, how to fear God, how to behave righteously, how to be perfect, and how to be upright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not mention anything to give even a hint that he knew the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The function of his kind of perfection cannot serve the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Benefiting Others</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The function of the Christian perfection stressed by James was also for benefiting others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Glorifying God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was also for glorifying God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his sense, glorifying God is to have good behavior among men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In an upcoming message, we want to go on to see the positive side of the genuine Christian perfection revealed in the entire divine revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is in contrast to the Christian perfection stressed by James.</S>
