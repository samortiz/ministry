   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN LIVING STONES FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: John 1:42; Matt 16:16-18; 1 Cor 3:9-13; 1 Pet 2:5; Eph 2:22; Rev 21:18-19a, 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's recovery is the recovery of life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these chapters we have been considering life and building in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not for the study of a book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are for God's goal and purpose which is life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other Christian writings, it is difficult to find one book that puts these two words together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever read such a term, "life and building"?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have heard the word "life" in Christianity, but we have rarely heard the word "building."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And we have never heard these two words together, "life and building."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the central point of the Lord's recovery is life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE ENEMY'S DISTRACTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan is so subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has distracted nearly all of the Lord's children from God's purpose through many good, scriptural, and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although there is nothing wrong with prophecy, many have been distracted by it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others have been distracted by many other good subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible is an all-inclusive book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many things are in the Bible, but they are not the main goal of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main goal of the Bible is life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nearly all of the sound, scriptural subjects have been utilized by the enemy to distract the Lord's children from life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan is happy if we spend all our time on so many scriptural things, as long as we do not see the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as we do not care for the building, and as long as God's eternal goal cannot be accomplished, Satan would be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many good teachings which on the one hand are helpful, on the other hand are distracting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Good, spiritual, and scriptural helps can become a frustration to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Any point of spirituality can become our distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as we are content with what we have, we are frustrated and distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It may be something genuinely of God, yet it becomes a distraction from God's goal and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>MISSING GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of us realize that the Catholic Church is quite devilish and even demonic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we must admit that thousands of heathen have been brought to the Lord by the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many devoted people are Catholics, spending all their time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But, though many have received help from the Catholic Church, they have been fully distracted from God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not one of them cares for God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All have been distracted and frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Other Christians are also distracted by desiring to be spiritual, powerful, holy, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No doubt these are all good, but they are not God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's purpose is not in our being powerful, holy, or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These very things have distracted many Christians from the central point of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>PREDESTINED TO BE STONES</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The central point of God's purpose is that you and I were predestined to be stones for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has no intention that we be merely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's intention is that we be stones for building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not to be stones for any kind of exhibition, but for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christians today talk much about the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They admire the miracles done by the Lord and all His teachings, but not many have ever noticed this verse in John's Gospel: "And he brought him to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone" John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Andrew brought his brother Simon to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Cephas, which simply means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first day he met the Lord Jesus, the Lord indicated that his destiny was to be a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not say that Simon's destiny was to be anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's intention was not merely to save Peter, but to make him a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Two or three years later, the Lord reminded Peter again about his being a stone for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Matthew 16:18, after Peter said that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Based on the revelation of John 1:42, the Lord's word in Matthew 16 should be translated in this way: "And I say also unto thee, That thou art a stone, and upon this rock I will build my church."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord used the word "Peter," He meant a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Peter recognized Him as the Son of the living God, and then the Lord reminded him that he was a stone for the building up of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is clear that Peter knew what the Lord meant, for later in his own writing, he wrote to the believers, "Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all have been predestined to be stones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our destiny is to be living stones built up as the spiritual house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must realize that this is not someone's opinion or concept, but the central point in the Word of God.</S>
