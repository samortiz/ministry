   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All Things Being Headed Up</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through the Church and for the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:10 says, Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need the Holy Spirit to show us the real significance of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we learn to live in God s life and gain a certain amount of knowledge regarding the church, the Holy Spirit will reveal to us that God needs a group of people who live in His life and allow His life to shine forth from them in order to bring all things into the light of life to be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though God s life is in us, if the light of life cannot be diffused out from us, we can never arrive at the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the brothers and sisters may be orderly and in one accord when we gather in a meeting hall, but if the lights were to suddenly go out, we would immediately be in darkness, and there would be cries and chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the light were restored, however, everyone would immediately be quiet, and the situation would become orderly again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, when the life of the Head passes through the church, His Body, and reaches all things, all things become headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where there is the life of the Head, there is the authority of the Head and also oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The heading up in Ephesians 1:10 refers to all things, and arriving at the oneness in 4:13 refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church arrives at the oneness, and then all things are headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the church arrives at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, all things will be headed up, the church will become a transparent church, and the light of life within the church will be fully diffused.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The light that is diffused shines on all things in order that all things may be in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way, all things are headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8 shows that the church has not yet arrived at the oneness, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All things are still subject to vanity and are groaning and travailing due to the slavery of corruption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their being subject to vanity proves that all things are not in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when the sons of God enter into the freedom of glory, there will be harmony without any struggle, friction, slavery, vanity, corruption, groaning, or travailing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will be the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, when the New Jerusalem is expressed, the life within her will shine forth, and the nations will walk by her light Rev 21:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time, no one will go astray, walk on the wrong way, or stand on the wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone will be in his own position, walk on the proper way, and be absolutely one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All things will be headed up and in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 1:10 implies that God heads up all things through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 22 says that God subjected all things under Christ s feet and gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 10 reveals the means: through the church Christ is the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 22 presents the aim: Christ is the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through indicates the means, and to indicates the aim.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, without the church Christ cannot be the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is through the church by means of the church, and because of the church that Christ can be Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, Christ is the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 10 first there is the church and then the heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is through the church that Christ can be the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 22, however, speaks of the heading up and then of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ heads up all things through the church and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is both the means and the aim of Christ s heading up of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God Himself is the life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s life operates in the church and shines forth from the church to be light to the nations; this is how He heads up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the heading up of all things is through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to understand the meaning of to the church, we must read verses 22 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 22 says that God subjected all things under Christ s feet, and verse 23 says that the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two verses speak of all things being subjected under Christ s feet and Christ filling all things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the church was merely the means for God to head up all things, the church would simply be a vessel used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church would be just like a bottle in the kitchen; when we use the bottle, we do not need to take care of its feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the church is not merely a vessel but the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we take care of our physical body, we need to pay attention to the feeling of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, as far as a bottle is concerned, it does not matter where we place it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A bottle has no feeling regarding where it is stored.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we always take care of our body s enjoyment, comfort, feeling, and sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Head governs all things, the Body also governs all things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When all things are subject to the authority of the Head, they are also subject to the authority of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Revelation the Lord said, He who overcomes...to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod,...as I also have received from My Father 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Revelation 20:4 says, They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Matthew 19:28 says, You who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is the Head of all things to His Body; He has subjected all things under His feet to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When He was glorified, the church was also glorified; when He was enthroned, the church was also enthroned; when He reigns, the church also reigns; when He governs all things, the church also governs all things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God s heading up of the church is the means.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, the church as a living Body with feeling and enjoyment is the aim.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ subjected all things under the feet of the church so that the church might rule over the universe with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, the church will receive the glory and exaltation that Christ has received and enjoy the result of His work.</S>
