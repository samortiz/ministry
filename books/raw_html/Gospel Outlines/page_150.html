<li>Man&rsquo;s conflict with God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the time Adam sinned, man has had conflict and discord with God.</li>
	<li>We have had conflict with God from the time of our birth.</li>
	<li>We are in conflict with God in all our daily living and walk.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man as God&rsquo;s enemy
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We have not only received from Adam a life that has conflict with God, but also in this life we have Satan&rsquo;s nature and are enemies to God.</li>
	<li>From the time of our birth, we are against God and are God&rsquo;s enemies.</li>
	<li>Our human living is against God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Reconciled to God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God sent the Lord Jesus to take away our sins through the redemptive work of the cross, thus resolving the conflict between God and us.</li>
	<li>God sent the Holy Spirit to move us and to cause us to repent and turn to Him.</li>
	<li>Once we believe in the Lord Jesus, our sins are forgiven and we are justified, accepted, and reconciled to God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be reconciled to God<br />
