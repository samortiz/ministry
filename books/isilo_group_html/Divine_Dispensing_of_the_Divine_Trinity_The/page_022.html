<p>Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). We could also substitute the word dispensing for the word giving. He became the life-dispensing Spirit. Our Christ is the Spirit that dispenses life into us. If Christ had not become the Spirit, He could not get into us. Spirit in Greek is <em>pneuma,</em> which also means air or wind. Christ is the Spirit, the air, and the wind for getting into us. Nothing could get into us so easily and thoroughly and continuously as the air. While I am speaking and you are listening, we are unconsciously getting air into us. This is a picture of Christ. We have our life in Him just like we have our life in the air. If we were in a room without air, we would die. To die is to stop breathing. When I stop breathing, I die. We have to breathe Christ into us. A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance wrote a number of good hymns which are very deep. One of these hymns is concerning breathing Christ into us (#255 in <em>Hymns</em>).</p>
<p>Why do we call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name? This is our breathing. Even this is our deep breathing. Physically speaking deep breathing is very healthy. To cry, O Lord Jesus! is deep breathing. If you practice this, you will see how healthy you will be. Sometimes it may seem that you cannot bear the murmuring and the long face of your wife. Then you need to call upon the Name. Don&rsquo;t forget that you are Enosh, a fragile man, who calls upon the name of the eternal One (Gen. 4:26). If you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus you will be energized. For example, you should not drive a car with a flat tire. That means it is short of air. Too many Christians today are short of the spiritual air. They have a &ldquo;flat tire.&rdquo; Some do not come to the meetings because they have a &ldquo;flat tire.&rdquo; They may say that they have problems with their wife or problems with a certain brother or problems with the elders. This is a flat tire. Don&rsquo;t blame your wife or that certain brother or the elders. Blame your flat tire. You have to go to the &ldquo;gas station&rdquo; and get some air for your flat tire. Where is the gas station? It is the church! Come to the church, and you would get the air. You will be filled up with the living air. Call on His name to be filled with air. This is the Spirit that dispenses life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">5. AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). Whatever God the Father is, whatever God the Son is, and whatever God the Spirit is, is all embodied in this one Person. Within Him are all the divine riches for dispensing God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">6. AS THE EFFULGENCE OF GOD&rsquo;S GLORY<br />
AND THE IMAGE OF THE SUBSTANCE</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the effulgence, the expression, of God&rsquo;s glory, and He is the very image, the expression of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15). He is the very expression of what God is. Again this is for the purpose of dispensing and infusing God into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">7. AS THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>Christ is the Apostle sent by God to minister God Himself to us (Heb. 3:1). A sent one, an apostle, is the one who brings something to others. Christ was the first Apostle in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy sent by God and from God to bring God to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">8. AS THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>He is not only the Apostle, but also the Captain of salvation (Heb. 2:10). God&rsquo;s salvation is a fighting, a battle. For fighting there is the need of an army, and for the army there is the need of the captain. Christ is the Captain of God&rsquo;s salvation for dispensing the life of God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">9. AS THE SAVIOR</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Savior (Titus 2:13). By reading Titus 2:13 carefully you can see that our Savior is just the great God. Jesus Christ is both the Savior and the great God to us. He is the great God becoming our Savior for the purpose of dispensing God into us, His saved ones.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
