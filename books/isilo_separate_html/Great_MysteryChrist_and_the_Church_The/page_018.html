<p>The church is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is corporate. We are not the church if we are separated from one another. Therefore, the Bible reveals that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The Lord Jesus Christ was incarnated to be a man with a physical body. However, the Body of Christ in Ephesians does not refer to a physical body with flesh and blood but to the mystical Body that is composed of millions of believers. The church is the Body of Christ; hence, the church possesses Christ and is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>It is impossible for a normal person to have a head without a body. This also applies to Christ. Christ is the Head; He has a Body, and He is the Body. It is difficult for Bible expositors to thoroughly expound this matter, because the Body of Christ is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being the Reality of the Body</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; Paul associates one Body with one Spirit, because the Spirit is the reality and essence of the church as the Body of Christ, just as wood is the reality and essence of a wooden table. The church is the Body of Christ, and the church is the Spirit, because the Spirit is the essence of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the Body, because the Spirit is the reality of the Body and the essence of the Body. The indwelling Christ is our life. However, if we live by the self or by the flesh, we are not the Body of Christ, because the Body of Christ is the Spirit. Only when we live by the Spirit can we be the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we know that the church is the mystery of Christ and the Body of Christ, we will realize that the church is not simply a gathering together of the believers. Only when we live in the Spirit are we the church. If we do not live in the Spirit, we are not the church. Consider two brothers who love the Lord, read the Bible often, and serve much. Both are captivated by the Lord Jesus, and they do not love the world, nor do they care about their future; they have abandoned everything for Jesus. Nevertheless, this does not make them the church. If they live in the flesh, murmur, criticize, or lose their temper, they are not the church. Brother A may say to Brother B, &ldquo;Why do you always speak from the podium? You should give others a chance.&rdquo; And Brother B may reply, &ldquo;Go ahead and speak!&rdquo; Is this the church? When we are not in the Spirit, we are not the church.</p>
<p>Suppose both brothers live in the mind or in culture. They may be very courteous and polite, but they are actually hypocritical. This is not the church. Because Brother A does not know what to say, he may ask, &ldquo;How have you been the past couple of days? How is your wife? How are the children?&rdquo; Even though Brother B is troubled, he may reply, &ldquo;Very good. Thank you.&rdquo; This is formality. Brother A is hypocritical because his question is a formality, and Brother B is also hypocritical because he is pretending that he is not suffering. Both brothers are not in the Spirit, and thus, they are not the church. If we do not live by the Spirit, we are not the church.</p>
<p>Today the church is weak. It is not advancing, it is not rich, it is not living, it is not high, and it is not released, because we do not live the church. The church is uniquely one, but there are many things that are not the church. We can be many things but not be the church. We can be meek not irritable, genteel not course, and prudent not foolish and still not be the church, because we are not in the Spirit. When we are not in the Spirit, we are not the church.</p>
<p>Being the church is not a simple matter. The church must be in the Spirit, and it must be the Spirit. It is easy for people to not be in the Spirit. For example, there is only one bull&rsquo;s eye on a target, and it is not easy to hit the bull&rsquo;s eye. If we do not hit the bull&rsquo;s eye, we have not hit the target.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>one Body and one Spirit</em> indicates that the Body is the Spirit and that the Spirit is the Body. Some Christians think that it is heresy to say that the church is the Spirit. They say, &ldquo;The Spirit is the Holy Spirit; how can you say that the Spirit is the church?&rdquo; They do not understand, because they lack light and experience. The Bible says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; The Body is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Body. However, there is a distinction: the Spirit outside of us is not the Body; only the Spirit dwelling in us is the Body. According to this principle, we are the Body because the Spirit is in us. When we are in the Spirit, we are the Body, but when we are not in the Spirit, we are not the Body.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 continues, &ldquo;Even as also you were called in one hope of your calling.&rdquo; The word <em>hope</em> refers to the transfiguration of our body, that is, to our entering into glory, our hope of glory. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;One Lord, one faith, one baptism.&rdquo; We have a living Lord. Those who believe in Him, receive Him, and are baptized will be raised together with Him. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is a living entity, an organism; it is the mingling of the Triune God with man. Verses 4 through 6 speak of the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father. The Father is the first in the Trinity; the Lord, the Son, is the second in the Trinity; and the Spirit is the third in the Trinity. The Triune God is fully mingled with the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
