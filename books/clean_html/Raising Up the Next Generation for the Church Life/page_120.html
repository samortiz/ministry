<h1 class="title">EXPECTING THE LORD&rsquo;S BLESSING,<br />
AND DOING THE UNIQUE WORK<br />

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 133; Rev. 21:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We need to treasure God&rsquo;s blessing and realize that in God&rsquo;s work everything depends on His blessing; if we see this, it will bring about a basic change in our labor for God&mdash;Matt. 14:19-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In serving the Lord, we should believe in and expect the Lord&rsquo;s blessing; to be under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing means that in our service the Lord gives us unexpected results, results that are not in proportion to the cause and that are far beyond our expectation.</li>
	<li>We need to learn to live in a way that does not hinder the Lord&rsquo;s blessing; the future of our service does not depend on our being right&mdash;it depends on the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</li>
	<li>Whatever we bring to the Lord must be broken for it to become a blessing to others; the broken bread became the satisfaction to all the hungry people, and there was great blessing&mdash;vv. 19-21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The oneness of the Triune God, which is the oneness of the Body of Christ, includes all that Christ is to us in and for God&rsquo;s economy; the practice of this oneness, the one accord, is the master key to every blessing in the New Testament&mdash;Psa. 133; Eph. 4:1-6; Acts 1:14; 1 Cor. 1:9-10; Phil. 1:27; 2:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Holy Spirit is the power, the means, and the factor for God&rsquo;s move on this earth, but that is just on one side; there is the need of another side, the human side; there is the need of another factor&mdash;the one accord&mdash;Acts 1:14; 2:46.</li>
	<li>If there were no Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s side, it would be impossible for the Lord to move on this earth; in the same principle, without the one accord on our side, God cannot move; but if we offer to the Lord this one accord, then we will match God, and anything can be done&mdash;Rom. 15:6; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 1:27; 2:2; 4:2.</li>
	<li>God will only grace and bless the one accord, that is, the practice of the oneness; in order to receive God&rsquo;s blessing we must practice the oneness by the one accord&mdash;Psa. 133; Acts 1:14.</li>
	<li>Day by day we have to move out of ourselves with the evil of division and into the divine &ldquo;Us,&rdquo; the Triune God as the blessing of oneness, and we have to remain in Him for His corporate expression; if we continually touch the Word and allow the Spirit to touch us day by day, we shall be sanctified by moving out of ourselves, our old lodging place, and into the Triune God, our new lodging place&mdash;John 17:15, 17, 21; 15:5; Eph. 5:26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Oneness is the full mingling of the Triune God with the saints; oneness nullifies all of our old creation and the natural man, sanctifies us from the Satan-ensnared world, and frees us from the world and Satan&mdash;John 17:2, 6, 11, 14, 17, 21-22; Eph. 4:4-6; Rom. 16:20.</li>
		<li>Under the anointing oil and the watering dew, we experience the commanded blessing of life on the ground of oneness&mdash;Psa. 133:3b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Our work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the work of God&rsquo;s economy, the work of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10; Col. 4:11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Body of Christ is organic and does not allow anything of human work, and the Body is not built up by using man&rsquo;s natural methods or the organization of human work&mdash;Eph. 4:16; Col. 2:19.</li>
	<li>Most of the work in today&rsquo;s Christianity is human work, is natural, and has nothing to do with the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12-16.</li>
	<li>In the recovery we should not have the thought that we can do a particular work according to our way; rather, we need to realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is only one work&mdash;the work of the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Col. 2:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, the unique goal of the Christian work should be the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Matt. 7:21-24; 1 Cor. 3:10; Heb. 12:22; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The co-workers must see that we should do only one work, which is to make God&rsquo;s chosen people regenerated ones, sanctified ones, renewed ones&mdash;the new man&mdash;transformed ones, conformed ones&mdash;those conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;and glorified ones; all those who will be in the New Jerusalem are this kind of people.</li>
	<li>In this way, we go up level by level until we reach the highest point, where we become the same; there is no more flesh and no more natural being; all are in the spirit; all are the kingdom of the heavens, and all are beings of the New Jerusalem; this is the highest point.</li>
	</ol></li>
