   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We now come to the third major step of Christ: His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After His death, Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What was the divine thought in this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God had planned that all creation should both be created through Christ and subsist in Him Col 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ must be the means of creating and the center of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, at a certain point, God's thought was to bring all things to an end by putting them to death in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But that is not the end, because God in Christ could never be conquered by death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Death can never hold Christ Acts 2:24 , for He is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He went into death willingly, and He stepped out of death boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even as all things were created through Christ and brought to death in Christ, so now all things are resurrected in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the divine thought: to create all things in Christ, to bring all things to death in Christ, and then to resurrect all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We, as believers, must pass through all these processes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know we have been created and, by the mercy of God, put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we must realize that we have also been resurrected in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unbelievers may know only the first step of the process.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were created, but as they have never experienced the death of Christ, they likewise have no share in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We, however, share both His death and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were dead in Christ, and we were raised up in Him too.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ's history is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was in death, and we were in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now He is in resurrection, and praise the Lord, so are we!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are in this resurrection because we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps you ask, Why did God put all things to death in Christ and then later bring all things to resurrection in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The answer is foreign to our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At creation, nothing of God Himself was mingled with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we search the Scriptures, we must conclude that at the time of creation man did not receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing of God was mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But through the death and resurrection of Christ, God mingled Himself with man!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOD AND MAN MINGLED</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How did God mingle Himself with man?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is beyond our natural conception.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ was incarnated as a man, and within this man is God, the source of life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This man, Christ, likened Himself to a grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life, we know, is in the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the life needs to be released; it is limited within the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can this life be released?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is released through death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we plant the grain into the earth and it dies, the life in it will be released to grow and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will produce many grains, the result of the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The grain is the man, Jesus; the life in this grain is the divine life of God Himself; the many grains are all those who are regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are the many grains with the divine life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Formerly we had nothing of God mingled with us, but now, through the death and resurrection of Christ, God Himself is mingled with us in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have God Himself in us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have been recreated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ, who is now our life, is the very embodiment of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be a Christian is much more than being forgiven, redeemed, and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is also that we are mingled with God in Christ through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are one with God; He lives in us!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ created us, brought us into death, and also brought us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His experiences are our experiences: when He died, we died; when He was resurrected, we were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be dead is to be released; to be resurrected is to be joined to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By death we were freed from everything of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fall of Adam put us into prison, but the death of Christ opened this prison, and now we are free!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But this is not the end, because by resurrection we are joined to everything of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are dead to everything of Adam and raised up to everything of Christ, because we are joined to God in Christ through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have been traveling for a number of years and have met quite a number of Christians of various backgrounds and teachings; yet I find very few who understand the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Apostle Paul said that he wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is something here which is mysterious and beyond human conception.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may say, "Brother, I understand the resurrection of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But I would ask you, What does it mean?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have spent considerable time collecting hymns on the resurrection of Christ; yet there is hardly one that is really useful!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These hymns merely relate the history of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Christ is risen, Hallelujah!" that's all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You can hardly find a hymn telling you that the resurrection is to be inwardly experienced by you, that it has brought Christ into you and that you are one with Him in it!</S>
