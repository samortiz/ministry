The source is the Father, the element is Christ the Lord, and the essence is the Spirit (Eph. 4:4-6). There is a marvelous essence available to all of us today, and that is the essence of the processed and consummated Triune God, which is the very essence of the Body of Christ. Ultimately, the church is a group of people who are in union with the Triune God and are mingled with the Triune God.</P><P>Ephesians 4:4-6 presents the real scenery of the Body of Christ. This group comprises four persons&#151;the Body, the Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the source. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers. This mingling is the constitution of the Body of Christ. The divine mingling began at our regeneration. The divine Spirit regenerated our human spirit and is now mingled with our spirit as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This mingling continues in our being as the divine essence of the processed and consummated Triune God permeates our inward being to transform us metabolically. This wonderful mingling makes us the counterpart of the constituting Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Body of Christ Being the Fullness<br>of the All-inclusive and All-extensive Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the Body of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ as the fullness, the expression, of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Constitution Being through the Dispensing<br>of the Father's Life and Nature, of the Son's Element Brought Forth by His Redemption,<br>and of the Spirit's Essence through His Sealing</H2><P>Now that we have seen what the Body of Christ is, we need to see the constitution of the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God. The Body of Christ is constituted through the dispensing of the Father's life and nature, of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption, and of the Spirit's essence through His sealing. This is a threefold dispensing involving the substance of the Father, the element of the Son, and the essence of the Spirit.</P><P>Ephesians 1:4 says that the Father chose us in Him, in Christ, before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish. Holiness is the very nature of God. God's constitution is holy. His substance is holy. God charges us to be holy. He said, "You shall be holy because I am holy" (1 Pet. 1:16). His desire is to dispense His very nature into our being. To be holy is not only to be separated from everything common but also to be saturated with the very divine, holy nature of God. In Ephesians 5:27 Paul expressed God's desire to have a glorious church that is holy and without blemish.</P><P>Ephesians 1:5 says that we were predestinated unto sonship. God's predestination has a goal, and that goal is sonship. To be a son of God means that we have God the Father's life. No father can beget a child without imparting his very life into that child. The life of our divine Father is a begetting life. We have been begotten of God with His divine life to be His sons (John 1:12-13).</P><P>The Body of Christ is also constituted through the dispensing of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption. Ephesians 1:7 says that we have redemption in Christ through His blood. In verse 10 God expresses His desire to head up all things in Christ. By means of the marvelous work of redemption in Christ, we were brought out of Adam, out of sin, and out of the world into Christ as our sphere and realm. In Christ as our sphere and realm, we receive the impartation of the life element of Christ. The very life of God embodied in the Son was imparted through Christ's redemption into God's people. In Christ's all-inclusive death many negative things were dealt with, but on the positive side there was the release of the divine life (John 12:24). This life was imparted into us at the time of our regeneration.</P><P>Now we come to the dispensing of the Spirit's essence through His sealing (Eph. 1:13). The essence of the Spirit as the living seal permeates our very being just as the ink of the seal saturates, soaks, and permeates the sealed paper. When we were regenerated, the sealing essence of the Spirit came into our being to soak and saturate us with the very essence of God.</P><P>This sealing designated us as God's inheritance. Ephesians 1:11 says, "In whom also we were designated as an inheritance." We may wonder how God could inherit us men of clay. But we need to see that through the dispensing of God's essence into us, there is the increase of gold and the decrease of clay. This sealing is unto the day of redemption (4:30). It is going on day by day. The very essence of the Spirit is permeating our very being until one day we will be completely transformed to be the precious material which can be inherited by God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
