   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN ON BEING A PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN TALKS 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Evening, January 24, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>VAIN DOCTRINES AND PRACTICAL WAYS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, what many people receive is but doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These doctrines do not render much benefit to the practical Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many spiritual terminologies are but terms only.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, to say that a certain person is fleshly or spiritual is but empty spiritual terms to some people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The foreigners spread the gospel to the East, but what many of them preached was but doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the end, the ones who preached gave nothing but doctrines, and the ones who listened heard nothing but doctrines, and neither knew what the words spoken meant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is like some people who have never seen snow, yet they keep talking about snow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The pastors in Christianity study in the seminaries and pick up a lot of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, one pastor has a wonderful plan; he has prepared fifty-two sermons, one for each week of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With this preparation, he has no fear of running out of sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This serves well for his congregation also, who think that by doing this, they will not be out of food or lacking in sermons all year round.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this kind of listening will only make a person big in his head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, many people know only the terms and have no idea what they really mean.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason for this is that they have never properly experienced the things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is to love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is to be humble?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is to follow the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is it for God to be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is to be led?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And what is to love the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am not here trying to give you a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not asking if you understand these doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is easy to understand the doctrine of love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as a person takes a cross-reference Bible, he can prepare a message on loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But he does not necessarily have the thing "love" itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the condition of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Christianity everybody says what everybody else is saying, and men only pay attention to the study of doctrines and the attendance of Sunday worship services.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is humility?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is it to hold the Bible in your arm and to walk slowly, looking at heaven every few steps?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is this humility?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of behavior is false humility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When people who behave this way lose their temper, they will yell and bang on the tables.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not merely be those who come to attend worship services or to listen to sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the flavor of Christianity is too strong among us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When someone comes to our city, we hope to receive some help, and we expect the visitor to come with an abundance of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But I can hardly believe that a person can receive any help under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you receive any help, it is some other kind of help; what you have received is but beautiful thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some Christians have large heads, small bodies, and almost no legs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some saints are experts in criticizing others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are good at listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are good at reading books, and they like to listen to famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are like the professional opera-goers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of people is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sooner or later, they will become tired of listening to messages or of attending services.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am speaking contrary words today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not expect you to understand my words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, I expect you not to understand my words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today it is not a question of understanding or not understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today it is a question of whether or not we are willing to be a practical Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christianity today is filled with fallen conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here we need a real revolution, a revolution that revolutionizes a person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In a group of seven or eight hundred people, how many are there who are serious about going on?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people like to attend revival meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the question is this: Will these meetings help a person to go on in the way of following the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not like people coming to me telling me that they have received help from me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not know you that well.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I did, I would ask you, "What kind of help have you received?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Did you receive help from me in expounding the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Or did you receive help from me in knowing the doctrines?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Doctrines will only give people something to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is a difference between doctrine and a way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A way affords a person a path to follow, whereas doctrines can only afford a person something to listen to and to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am not here helping you to know more about doctrines or to have a bigger head.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not ask me how a portion of the Scripture should be interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to be a practical person, living a practical life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In Shanghai some young people came to me and asked me about the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I told them that whether or not the Lord will come soon is not their concern.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What they have to do is to preach the gospel and to learn to love the Lord more.</S>
