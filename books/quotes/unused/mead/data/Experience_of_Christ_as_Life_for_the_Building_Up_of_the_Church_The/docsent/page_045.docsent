   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTERING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The life-giving Spirit is also the ministering Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 3:8 speaks of the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this second Epistle, the gifts of the Spirit are replaced with the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Balaam's donkey received the gift of speaking in a human language, of speaking in tongues, but that was not a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The donkey received such a gift suddenly, but a ministry takes time to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A ministry is produced in a person because Christ has been wrought into him for many years, not just overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ministry is produced through years of the Lord's working, dealing, and building up bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes when a saint speaks, you can realize he is exercising his gift.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when another saint speaks, you realize that he has a real ministry because something has been built and wrought into his being through many sufferings over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once something of Christ has been wrought into you, nothing can take it away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you experience Christ through sufferings, the ministry of Christ with you is enriched, strengthened, and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then what you speak comes out of your constitution, your very being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not a gift but a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the apostle Paul ministered, he was not merely exercising his gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul ministered Christ so richly because something of Christ had been wrought into him and built into him to become one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, Paul was the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only his word but also his person was the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The ministry does not minister knowledge, doctrine, or the exposition of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It ministers the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ministry of the Spirit imparts all that Christ is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you listen to certain speakers, you may feel that you only receive knowledge without anything watering or feeding you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But you may listen to someone who is not so eloquent, yet you have the deep feeling that you are nourished, watered, and vivified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the Spirit of life ministering Christ into you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit is the reality of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not have the Spirit, you do not have the reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not have the Spirit, you do not have the reality of light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not have the Spirit, you do not have the reality of love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not have the Spirit, you do not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, you have mere biblical terminology without reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reality of every item of Christ's riches is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord said that all that the Father is and has was given to Him, and whatever He received was passed on to the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the Spirit of reality passes on what He has to us John 16:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that He leads us into all the reality of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He ministers Christ as everything into us.</S>
