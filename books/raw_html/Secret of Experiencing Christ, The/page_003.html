<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Self-existing and Ever-existing One&#151;<br>the Great I Am</H2><P>The Bible shows us that this Christ who is God is self-existing and ever-existing (Exo. 3:14). He has no beginning and no ending. In the Old Testament His name is Jehovah (Exo. 3:15). The divine title Jehovah actually means "to exist." It is similar in meaning to the English verb "to be." Jesus Christ is Jehovah, the great I Am, the great To Be (John 8:24, 28, 58). In the past He was, in the present He is, and in the future He will be. Every visible thing will pass away, but Christ remains forever (Heb. 1:10-12). He is the unique To Be.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Jehovah, the Triune God&#151;<br>the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</H2><P>Exodus 3:15-16 reveals that, as Jehovah, Christ is the Triune God. The term "Triune God" does not mean that there are three Gods. It means that the one unique God is triune; He is the three-one God. He is one, yet three, and three, yet one. He is one God as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). This is a mystery which we cannot explain. We cannot explain how one can be three and three can be one. Christ is the unique God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Eternal Word, God Himself</H2><P>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In this verse Christ is revealed as the eternal Word, who is God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Creator</H2><P>The Bible also reveals that Christ is the Creator (John 1:3; Heb. 1:10). The universe is His creation (Col. 1:16). He created the heavens and the earth. He created billions of items in the universe, and He created mankind, including you and me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Son of God</H2><P>Christ is God, and He is also the Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16). In the Bible the Son of God signifies God's expression. Even in a human sense, the son is always the father's expression. When you see a son you realize the face of the father. Christ as the Son of God is the expression of God.</P>
