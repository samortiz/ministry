   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN RECEIVING PEOPLE IN THE CHURCHES AN EXPLANATION OF THE FACT AND THE PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We now come to the question concerning our receiving of people in the churches, that is, how to determine whether to baptize someone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To baptize someone is to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This matter is clear to us in principle, but we still need to carefully consider its practical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the past few years our principle for receiving people, that is, for determining whether or not to baptize people, was right.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we must confess that we have been weak and short in carrying out this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may not have been clear at the time, but looking back, the facts indicate that our practice had certain defects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, some who did not have a relationship with the Lord were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were clear concerning the principle that only a saved person should be baptized, that is, a person who has believed, who has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not baptize those who receive the Lord Jesus nominally but do not receive God s life and have no inward relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our practice, however, we have baptized some who we thought were saved but who did not actually have a relationship with the Lord or have God s life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In some localities we have met people like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consequently, we should reconsider our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although our principle is right, the dependability of our practice is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the past, at certain times, we baptized many people; however, few among them remained after being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One reason is that we were not able to take care of such large numbers adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they were truly saved, they eventually became cold due to their environment or inadequate care.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may have remained cold for two years but turned and were revived during the third year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some, perhaps a small number, were never clear concerning salvation, yet due to our inaccurate judgment, we baptized them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the end, they left after being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can point to several people whose salvation we initially doubted and who, we are now quite certain, were never saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Despite our initial doubts, we indeed baptized them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now they neither meet nor bear the testimony of being Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This compels us to reconsider our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must admit that we have viewed the matter of receiving and baptizing people too lightly and inadequately, without realizing its seriousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is especially true of the brothers who contact people and are responsible for deciding whom to baptize.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems that we have made the decision regarding receiving and baptizing people an easy and convenient matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our basic problem is that we have not taken this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times we have simply accepted a person s word; however, the basic principle is that we must be serious when determining whether one should be received and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If not, I am afraid that due to our negligence in this matter there will be confusion among us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The matter of whom to receive and baptize has been a great controversy in the church from the time the first apostles passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Various Christian groups and sects all hold different views concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our principle in this matter is that we follow the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only those who believe should be baptized Mark 16:16; Acts 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This principle is correct, but how do we identify a person as a believing one, a saved one?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This involves a number of difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we determine whether or not a person has been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For him to be saved is one matter, but for us to determine whether he is saved is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is much room for interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps one brother thinks that a man is not saved, but another thinks that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may all agree to the principle of baptizing only those who are saved, but the difficulty lies in verifying the details.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One brother may think that a certain person is saved, but I may think otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, there is much to consider when determining whether or not a person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The definition of salvation among different believers also varies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since there is variation in determining who is genuinely saved and in our understanding of what it means to be saved, there are always problems related to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not have any problems in regard to principle, but we face difficulties in regard to carrying out the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>TWO ASPECTS OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>BELIEVING AND BEING BAPTIZED</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to our observation, for the past few years we have not had the wrong principle, but we have had an inaccurate understanding of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We also were not accurate in determining who was saved; hence, certain problems arose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What does it mean to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who is a saved one?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is the definition of salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be fully saved requires first that we believe and second that we be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mark 16:16 says, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible does not say that he who believes and is saved shall be baptized but that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, baptism is based on believing, not on being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To receive complete salvation, we must believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, believing and being baptized are not two steps but can be considered as two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only when both feet step forward can they make a complete step.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To believe and be baptized is one step, a complete step involving two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To receive salvation requires only one step: believing and being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Gospel of Mark says clearly that in order to receive God s salvation, one must believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, this matter is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Strictly speaking, some portions of God s salvation can be received and obtained immediately through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In similar manner, when we enter a house, we must first put one foot forward.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as we put one foot forward, we have entered halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once we bring our other foot forward, we are able to fully enter into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As soon as we believe, we receive a portion of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It may not be complete, but it is at least partial salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Strictly speaking, baptism is based on believing, and baptism is also based on salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a person believes, he truly receives a portion of salvation, and based upon this portion of salvation, he can be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In another sense, baptism is not based upon salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A person is first baptized and then saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is true that a portion of salvation can be received only through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, being saved through believing, through baptism, and through believing and being baptized are three ways of describing the steps of salvation, and they do not conflict with one another.</S>
