   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO WAYS GIFT AND AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today I think that two ways are clearly set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the Lord can really break through in our midst, the way we have taken for the past ten, twenty, or thirty years will be completely reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our view cannot be the same as before; it has to be broken and crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not Leaving Anyone Out</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, you should not use a brother just because he is useful and leave him out if he is not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church no member should be left out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not the way taken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, if the Lord is going to recover His testimony, He must make all the one-talented ones rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All who belong to the Lord are the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone must rise up and be in his function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If this is the case, you will see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While you are here on the mountain, consider every place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You almost have to say, "Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where is Christ?''</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that neither the church nor the Lord is there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you go out, never despise the one-talented ones, never replace them, and never suppress them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to trust them from your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to cause them to work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God has the assurance to call them to be servants, you too should have the assurance to call them to be servants.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Authority Dealing with the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, in the church we are not afraid of fleshly activities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two lines are to be established in the church one is authority and the other is gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the one-talented ones must come forth to serve, work, and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may ask, "If the one-talented ones come forth with their flesh, what shall we do?''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me say that the flesh must be dealt with, and the way to deal with it is by using the authority which represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Gift and authority are two entirely distinct things; gift is gift, and authority is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The one-talented ones must use their gift, and with those who are fleshly, you must use authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a brother brings in the flesh while he is working, you must tell him, "Brother, that will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You cannot bring that in.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Tell him, "This attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not allow you to have this attitude.''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you speak with him in this way, he will probably go home the next day and not do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you will have to look him up and say, "No, you still should do the work.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The flesh may come in again, but you still must let him do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must say to him again, "You must do this, but we will not allow you to do that.''</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Always use authority to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the greatest test.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once the Lord uses the one-talented ones, their flesh will immediately be brought in. The flesh and the one talent are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must refuse the flesh, but we have to use that one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today's situation is that we bury the flesh, they bury the one talent, and the church has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This cannot be!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to use authority to deal with the flesh, but we also have to ask them to bring forth their talent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps they will say, "If I work, it will not do, and if I do not work, it will not do either.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So what shall I do?''</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must say to them, "Indeed, if you work, it is wrong because you bring in the flesh; but if you do not work, it is also wrong because you bury the talent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The one talent must come in, but not the flesh.''</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church if the authority can be maintained and the functions of all the members brought in, you will see a glorious church on the earth, and the way of recovery will be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not know how many more days the Lord has set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I believe our way will be clearer and clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to use all our thought and all our strength so that all the brothers and sisters may rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When that time comes, the church will be manifested and the Lord will return.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us so that we may do the best.</S>
