   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The incarnation was wonderful, and the crucifixion is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have no human words to explain the incarnation in full; neither can we fully explain the fact of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Bearing Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the cross Christ bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Three verses are very clear regarding this: 1 Peter 2:24, 1 Corinthians 15:3, and Hebrews 9:28.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses all say that Christ bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you read the four Gospels concerning Christ s death, you will see that He was crucified from nine o clock in the morning, the third hour Mark 15:25 , till three o clock in the afternoon, the ninth hour Mark 15:33; Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the midst of these six hours there was noontime, the sixth hour Mark 15:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The noontime divided these six hours into two periods of three hours each.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man s persecution took place in the first three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man nailed Him to the cross, mocked Him, and afflicted Him in every possible way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in the final three hours God came in to judge Him Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is indicated by the darkness that came over the whole land at noontime.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God put all the sins of mankind upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Made Sin for Us</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the last three hours, in the eyes of God Christ was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was then on the cross that God condemned sin in the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:3 says that God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin as the brass serpent in the form of a serpent John 3:14 , condemned sin in the flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sin was judged on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only did Christ bear our sins; He was made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 and was judged by God once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With Our Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Entire Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, when Christ was crucified, all His believers were crucified with Him Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He was incarnated, He took us upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He put on blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, when He was crucified, we were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From God s viewpoint, before we were born we were crucified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ was crucified, not only were our sins dealt with and not only was our sin dealt with; we ourselves were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, Romans 6:6 says, Our old man has been crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Besides this, the entire creation was also crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ died, the veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom Matt 27:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From top to bottom indicates that it was not man s doing, but God s doing from above.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God rent that veil into two pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the veil there were cherubim embroidered Exo 26:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Ezekiel 1:5, 10 and 10:14-15, cherubim were living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cherubim on the veil, then, indicated the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Upon the humanity of Christ were all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the veil was rent, all the creatures were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this we can see that the death of Christ was all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It dealt with our sins, with our sin, with our self, our old man, and with the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sins, sin, man, and the entire creation were all dealt with on the cross.</S>
