        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING PEOPLE TO PRAY<br />
AND SERVE IN SPIRIT</h1>
<p>There are two verses in the New Testament that speak of the relationship between God&rsquo;s dwelling place and our spirit. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; We are being built together in the Lord to be a dwelling place of God, and this dwelling place is in our spirit. First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; We are being built up to be a spiritual house; hence, building is closely related to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING BUT NOT SEEING<br />
SIGNIFICANT SPIRITUAL RESULTS</h2>
<p>In recent years we have established numerous regular weekly meetings, and we even have special times for special meetings. In nearly every meeting a message is given. We give a message at the end of the bread-breaking meeting, and we do the same in the prayer meeting. There is rarely a meeting that does not involve giving a message and listening to a message. According to our concept, a meeting without a message would not have much meaning. In addition to meetings, we have many service activities. We are thankful that the elders and those in the various districts give of their time and strength in the Lord&rsquo;s service. Many brothers and sisters have jobs or household responsibilities. Additionally, some do not have much free time, some are not physically strong, and some are financially limited. Although the saints are under various kinds of limitation, all willingly participate in the services in the church. In short, we have many meetings, and we also have numerous service activities. However, if we carefully review our situation, we will realize that the spiritual results from these meetings and activities are not satisfactory. We have many meetings with many messages, and we also have many activities, but the spiritual results do not match the amount of our labor.</p>
<p>Consider the bread-breaking meeting. If seventy saints meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in a certain district, fewer than half release their spirit to worship God by praying and praising in the meeting. If even half the saints would open their spirit, exercise their spirit, and release their spirit to pray, praise, and worship, the meeting would be more living and enriched. Regrettably, more than half the saints never exercise their spirit to pray in the bread-breaking meetings. The saints who prayed this month are the same ones who prayed in prior months. Simply speaking, those who pray always seem to pray, and those who do not pray never seem to pray.</p>
<p>We should not think that the number of saints in the bread-breaking meeting prevents some from praying. Someone who does not pray in the bread-breaking meeting tends to be weak in the matter of personal prayer as well. Even if such a one were praying with only another brother, he would still be hesitant in his prayers. His prayers are like smoking flax in need of being fanned into flame (2 Tim. 1:6). Many of the saints who do not pray are not occasional visitors; they regularly attend the weekly message meetings and the bread-breaking meetings. Nevertheless, they do not pray, and they do not open their mouth or exercise their spirit. No matter how much we try to help, they always seem reluctant to pray. According to a conservative estimate, this is the condition of more than fifty percent of the saints. If, among seventy saints in a bread-breaking meeting, thirty-five would pray regularly, the meeting would become richer and more living. At most, only thirty to forty percent of the saints function regularly.</p>
<p>We have worked in Taipei for many years, holding many conferences and trainings. Moreover, the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and responsible ones in the districts all labor in service together. In spite of this, very few saints pray regularly in the meetings. If we only had large joint meetings, which do not provide many opportunities for the saints to open their mouth, it would be understandable that many do not pray. However, there are more than thirty districts in the church in Taipei, and for a period of time the saints have been exercising to release their spirit and blend in spirit. Nevertheless, we still have only limited results. We continue to hear good reports that the number of saints who are praying is increasing and that their prayers are stronger, but we cannot be satisfied with this. Although we have many meetings, give many messages, and have many activities, the percentage of saints who open their mouth to exercise their spirit and release their spirit in the meeting is still too low. This indicates that our spiritual condition is poor.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
