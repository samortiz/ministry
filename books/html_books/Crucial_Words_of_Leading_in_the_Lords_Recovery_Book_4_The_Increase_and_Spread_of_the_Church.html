<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains twelve messages given by Brother Witness Lee from January 14 through 19, 1985, when he was in Taiwan leading the churches to practice the God-ordained way. This series of messages was spoken in the church in Taipei in a conference with the general subject: The Increase and Spread of the Church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH<br />
AND GROWTH IN LIFE BEING<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we confess that we are still corrupt; hence, we need the cleansing of Your precious blood. Lord, thank You that Your blood always cleanses us. By this precious blood we are kept in the Holy of Holies to fellowship with You. Lord, we are all willing to open to You; we pray that You would bring us into Yourself so that we may behold Your glorious face in the Holy of Holies. Visit us and touch our deepest part so that every one of us will bow our heads and worship You.</p>
<p>Lord, remove our defilement, our prejudices, and our traditional ways of thinking. Have mercy on us so that the veils on our hearts may fall away. Lord, open the heavens to us in these days. Be open to us, and may Your Word also be open to us. Open our spirit, and give us a clear mind to understand Your word and see Your move.</p>
<p>We pray that You would visit all the dear saints. You are the God who gains the victory over all men; You are the Lord of all men. O Lord Jesus, You are so rich to each of us; Your grace and riches are available to those who seek after You. Whoever calls upon Your name will enjoy You. Visit us now. We pray for all who seek after You. We look to You for Your blessing; make this moment a moment of blessing. Lord, we come before You and gather around Your Word. We really want to know You and Your way; may You clearly shine on us and guide us. In the name of the Lord we pray. Amen.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will begin to fellowship about specific practices related to the increase and spread of the church. The burden in these messages is mainly related to the increase and spread of the church. The matter of increase is related to a church locally, whereas the matter of spread involves the church&rsquo;s spreading out. The churches on earth should increase, and the church on the earth should spread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WITNESSES</h2>
<p>In the Chinese Union Version translation, Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,...you shall be My testimony...unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; However, in Greek this verse does not speak about being the Lord&rsquo;s testimony; rather, it speaks about being the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. There is a big difference between these two. In the translation of the Bible, many versions often make the mistake of overemphasizing tone and style while overlooking the meaning of the words in the original text. However, the Bible was written not as a book of literature but as a book of revelation.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul came from Tarsus, a large city well known for its learning, and he was trained at the feet of Gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people (5:34; 22:3). All the readers of the New Testament acknowledge Paul&rsquo;s writing skill. However, he did not sacrifice spiritual meaning for the sake of literary considerations. We are preparing a new translation of the Bible based on this principle. We may not have the highest literary attainments, but we will express the original meaning of the words in the New Testament to the best of our efforts.</p>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the word <em>witnesses</em> is the best translation of the word in the original text. This word literally means &ldquo;martyrs.&rdquo; This word does not refer to an objective testimony but to a group of persons who are martyrs. A martyr is a witness. God&rsquo;s divine truth in the New Testament was written originally in Greek. In our translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, we always try to follow the sense of the meaning in the original text. This is because we are trying to convey the divine truth of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECT OF THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES&mdash;<br />
THE PROPAGATION OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>The subject of Acts is &ldquo;The Propagation of the Resurrected Christ in His Ascension, by the Spirit, through the Disciples, for the Producing of the Churches&mdash;the Kingdom of God.&rdquo; In brief, the book of Acts speaks of &ldquo;the propagation of the resurrected Christ.&rdquo; This propagation involves the reproduction of Christ or, using printing terminology, the reprinting of Christ. In printing, there is always an original version that is printed in mass quantities. Every printed copy is the same as the original version; it is a reprint, a reproduction, of the original. This is the meaning of propagation.</p>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said that when a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit. In the propagation of many grains, every kernel of grain is the same as the original planted grain. The many grains are the propagation and increase of the original one grain. In the Gospels we can see such a wonderful One. He lived on the earth and then passed through death and resurrection. In His resurrection as the Spirit of life, He entered into those who believed into Him, and in His ascension He poured the economical Spirit upon His believing disciples. As a result, these disciples not only had Him within them as life but also upon them as power. As such, they were His propagation, His many grains.</p>
<p>As the propagation of the Lord Jesus, these disciples needed to propagate as well. On the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up with eleven disciples and gave a message, and as a result, three thousand people were led to salvation. These three thousand people were a mass propagation. This may be likened to a grain of wheat being planted and bearing thirty grains, which in turn are planted and produce a hundred grains each. Thus, all three thousand grains are the propagation of one initial grain.</p>
<p>Throughout the book of Acts there is a continual propagation. Chapter 1 speaks of the preparation for the propagation, and from chapter 2 onward there is a propagation that continues through the last chapter. Bible scholars and readers acknowledge that the book of Acts does not have an ending; it is continuing even now. If there were a written record of the continuing acts of the propagating disciples, we might have twenty-eight thousand chapters. Christ&rsquo;s propagation has never ceased, even though the record in Acts goes only to around A.D. 66. Christ&rsquo;s propagation did not stop with Paul. It went west from Asia Minor to Europe, south to Africa, and east to India. According to historical accounts, many believe that the apostle Thomas brought this propagation to India. When Columbus sailed west and discovered a new continent, this propagation came from Europe to America. Today the propagation of Christ has been extended throughout the earth.</p>
<p>In recent days methods of transportation and new ways of video and audio transmission are continually being improved, making the world seem smaller and smaller and more convenient for Christ&rsquo;s propagation. Consider the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery: A message given in a meeting can reach every continent on the earth in less than a week through video and sound recordings. In less than a month the messages can be translated into different languages and printed as books. All this is for Christ&rsquo;s propagation.</p>
<p>Acts is specifically on Christ&rsquo;s propagation; this propagation produces the churches. The churches are not only Christ&rsquo;s propagation but also God&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s propagation, the churches, and the kingdom of God are synonymous. Christ&rsquo;s propagation is Christ&rsquo;s increase; it is also the spread of Christ. Christ not only propagates, He spreads to the four corners of the earth. This increase and spread are the church, and the church is God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth today. The entire content of Acts is focused on the propagation, increase, and spread of Christ, which produce churches on earth in locality after locality, and these churches are the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPAGATION OF THE FIRST MAN, ADAM</h2>
<p>God created a man, who became old, and He also prepared a man, who became new. In man&rsquo;s eyes there have been thousands upon thousands of people after Adam, including Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David. In God&rsquo;s eyes, however, there have been only two men throughout the history of man: Adam is the first man and Christ is the second man. First Corinthians 15:45 and 47 speak of the first man, Adam, who is out of the earth, and the second man, Christ, who is out of heaven. Christ is called the last Adam. Other than these two, there is no third man. Every man after Adam but before Christ is part of the first man, Adam. Any man who has been born after Christ but who has not believed into Christ is also only a part of the first man, Adam. Only those who have been born after Christ and who have believed in the Lord are part of the second man, Christ. Those who have believed in the Lord and who are saved have been transferred into Christ.</p>
<p>Every believer is both in Adam and in Christ. From the standpoint of our experience, we can also be in the self. For example, when a brother prays in the morning, he can be in Christ, but if his prayer is interrupted by his wife, he can easily find himself in Adam. If he draws from his cultural upbringing to control his temper, he will be in the self. At first he is in Christ; as soon as he is interrupted by his wife, he is in Adam; and once he draws upon his cultural upbringing to control his temper, he is in the self. This is our experience. I have been saved for sixty years, but I have not completely put off Adam.</p>
<p>Acts 17:26 says that God &ldquo;made from one every nation of men.&rdquo; This means that God created one man; He did not create two men, much less billions of men. Rather, He created Adam, blessed him, and told him to &ldquo;be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28). This speaks of the propagation of Adam. Propagation is a natural law of God for men. Once a person is married, there will be propagation. When I was saved sixty years ago, I was not married, but after being married, more than thirty people have been propagated through my children and grandchildren. All these people are &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; in my &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo;; they are my propagation.</p>
<p>Today Adam has been propagated to become a great kingdom; all the people living in the world are citizens of his kingdom. This truly is a fulfilment of God&rsquo;s words concerning being fruitful and multiplying and filling the earth. Many families in China take pride in the fact that multiple generations live in the same house as a big family, but strictly speaking, the only big family is Adam&rsquo;s family. From Adam to Jesus there are seventy-seven generations, and from Jesus until now there have been many more generations. This propagation is tremendous.</p>
<p>To be fruitful and multiply is to propagate, to increase; to fill the earth is to spread. Increasing and spreading correspond with human history. For example, the Chinese race moved from the Middle East eastward, passed the Pamirs, and reached China. The Bible tells us that Adam was created in the region of Mesopotamia, which is in close geographic proximity to Europe, Asia, and Africa. From Mesopotamia, mankind spread eastward to Asia, southward to Africa and westward to Europe. Mankind increased and then spread in four directions to fill the earth. When Columbus discovered the Americas, the whole globe became the territory for the increase and spread of the first man, Adam, through his descendants.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPAGATION OF THE SECOND MAN, CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first man, Adam, is a type of the second man, Christ. The propagation of Christ began in Jerusalem, which is also a place where Europe, Asia, and Africa meet. In Acts 1:8 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s witnesses are His propagation. Every believer of Christ is a witness of Christ, and every witness is Christ&rsquo;s propagation, just as every grain of wheat is the propagation of the original grain.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, every believer should be a witness, having the spirit of a martyr, not loving the world, and being able to sacrifice his life for the Lord. If we are willing to die for Christ, forsake the world, and not care for anything, we will be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses and His propagation. In this way Christ will increase.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is not enough for Christ merely to increase; there is a need for Him to spread. The Lord wanted the disciples to increase in Jerusalem, but He wanted them also to spread to Judea, to Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth. Paul mentioned that he not only wanted to go to Rome but also to Spain (Rom. 15:28-29). At that time Spain was equivalent to &ldquo;the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; By the time Columbus discovered the new continent, the uttermost part of the earth to the west was not Spain but the west coast of the United States. Although the Lord did not tell the disciples that the earth is round, He wisely charged them to spread to the &ldquo;uttermost part of the earth,&rdquo; which means that the gospel has to be preached throughout the entire known world.</p>
<p>History tells us that mankind has progressively filled the earth through the footsteps of Christians preaching the gospel. The growth and development of politics, military affairs, culture, and trade all reflect the influence of Christian &ldquo;footsteps.&rdquo; The preaching of the gospel by Christians to the uttermost part of the earth has resulted in the map of the world being continually redrawn. Christians sailed from Spain to the east coast of America, and from there they spread to the west coast. Eventually, the spread of mankind has circumscribed the globe.</p>
<p>Throughout subsequent generations Christians have circled the globe many times in order to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s commission concerning &ldquo;unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; In light of the Lord&rsquo;s charge to increase and spread, we are negligent in responding to His commission because we are so set and settled. Hence, I have no burden to give you some teachings; I only want to fellowship about our way of practice. From the day that God created man, He had no plans for us to stay in one place permanently. Even I travel back and forth across the Pacific Ocean because of the Lord&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<p>Since God &ldquo;made from one every nation of men&rdquo; (Acts 17:26) and told man to be &ldquo;fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28), men must move in order to fill the earth. <em>Fill</em> in Hebrew means &ldquo;occupy to the full.&rdquo; God views the earth as being empty unless man occupies and fills up its space. Today there are twenty million people on the little island of Taiwan; it is being &ldquo;occupied to the full.&rdquo; If we lift up our eyes and see, we have to admit that even though the population of the world is great, there are many places that are still empty. For example, I once traveled by car from Los Angeles to Texas. Along the way we saw unlimited stretches of land with very few towns; it was mostly unoccupied land. It is a pity that nations in the world pass laws to restrict immigration. Although this may frustrate God&rsquo;s &ldquo;policy,&rdquo; He is still the sovereign Lord. Jesus is the Ruler of the kings on earth, and several presidents of the United States have amended immigration laws to allow, for example, more Chinese to immigrate to the United States.</p>
<p>The God whom we serve is truly the Ruler of the heavens and earth. I believe that one day every piece of unoccupied land will be filled with men. We should not worry about there being too many people. If every country would open up, there would be no sense of being overcrowded. The United States is very big, but the empty land in Brazil is even larger than the empty land in the United States; there are many more trees than people living along the Amazon. The Lord will eventually have a way to cause Adam&rsquo;s race to fill the whole earth.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s word stands firm in heaven forever (Psa. 119:89); this fact is beyond argument. No other book in this world tells us that men should be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth; only God&rsquo;s Word tells us this. After He created man, He simply said, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28). These words describe six thousand years of human history. More than eighty years ago I was born in Tunghsiang, in a village of not more than ninety families, in Penglai County of the province of Shantung. Never in my dreams did I think that I would come to the United States with my family. This was not of me; it was God who blew a great wind. God said that men should be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth; no one can change God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Everything of the old creation is a type of the new creation. Just as the propagation of Adam was fruitful and filled the earth, the propagation of Christ should also be fruitful and fill the earth by increasing and spreading to every place. Sometimes Christians sigh when they compare the number of people in the world with the number of believers, but we should not be disappointed. Eventually the believers of the Lord will prevail. In the future the Lord will definitely open up the United States and Brazil, and eventually He will come Himself to take over the world. He will judge those who should be judged. At that time the earth will be His, and His propagation will fill the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE CHURCH IN TAIPEI</h2>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord, I worked in Chefoo and then went to Shanghai, the largest city in China. In May 1949, there was a strong wind from the Lord to go to Taiwan. When I looked at the outward conditions then, I did not know why the Lord sent me to Taiwan. Later I felt that I should travel by train south to Kaohsiung, stopping at stations along the way to visit the scattered saints. I went to Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung and saw that there was a group of brothers in each place. This showed me the need of the work in Taiwan. When I returned to Taipei, I fellowshipped with the brothers, and we decided to start the work on August 1.</p>
<p>At that time there were at most three to five hundred saints on the whole island, most of whom were from China and had been scattered throughout the island. By 1956 this number increased to thirty-five to forty thousand, and close to half of these met in the church in Taipei. Every brother and sister would complete an information card when they were baptized. According to these cards, there were between fifteen and seventeen thousand saints in the church in Taipei in 1956. The number of people increased very quickly; it was truly the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace.</p>
<p>Later, because of frustrations and disruptions, our increase almost stopped from 1956 to 1984. According to our record, in 1956 there were approximately three thousand people participating regularly in the church life. Today, after almost thirty years, there are about five thousand five hundred saints participating regularly in the church life with about three thousand five hundred in the meetings. Looking at these figures, there has not been much increase in the past thirty years. There has also not been much spread. In 1956 there were fifty local churches; today there are eighty or more local churches. Only thirty or more churches have been added, and some of the larger cities still do not have a church. Of the saints who went abroad, only a few spread to the United States, and even fewer spread to other countries.</p>
<p>We must use the Lord&rsquo;s word, especially the book of Acts, to check our condition. The Lord Jesus started to minister when He was thirty years old. Three and a half years later He was crucified, and then He resurrected and ascended to the heavens. The events over the next approximately thirty years are recorded in the book of Acts. During these years the church increased rapidly and spread immensely even in a time in which it was not convenient to travel from one place to another. Nearly two thousand years ago there were no steamships or trains, much less cars or airplanes. Nevertheless, in such old and backward conditions the church spread from Jerusalem to Spain, which was the uttermost part of the earth at that time, in less than thirty years. Today it is very convenient to travel from one place to another, not only from one place to another within Taiwan but also to other countries. Despite these advantages, generally speaking, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan has remained stagnant for a quarter of a century; this is the heavy burden within me.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING THE PATHWAY, FUTURE,<br />
AND PROSPECT OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>I hope that we all could be quiet before the Lord and reconsider our pathway and future. We have been saved, and to us the prospect of seeing the Lord in the future is very good. However, we must ask whether the Lord has a similar feeling when there is such a need for the increase and spread of the church. Consider the seven hundred million people in India who are in a desolate condition. Some English missionaries went there in the past, but not many people are willing to go there now to preach the gospel. Honestly speaking, we should send saints from Taiwan to India and Burma.</p>
<p>Recently a local church has been raised up in southern India by a secondary school teacher who met with us for a year when he was in the United States. Subsequently he received a burden and returned to India to establish churches there. At the same time a church has been raised up in northern Burma, and it has been in contact with the church in Bangkok, Thailand. There is a great need in these places. We could not meet the need even if we sent three hundred saints to work in India and another hundred to work in Burma. The Arabic-speaking world is also desolate; we need to receive a burden from the Lord to spread there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STEP&mdash;<br />
GOSPELIZING AND TRUTHIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s will is not for us to stay in Taiwan to be in a life of ease and comfort, to receive blessings, to be cultivated in the truth, to grow in life, to be spiritual, and then to see Him when He returns. This may be very good for us, but this will not satisfy the Lord. Before focusing on preaching the gospel to the uttermost part of the earth, we need to consider Taiwan. Over the past twenty or more years, a church should have been established in every town on the island of Taiwan. Nevertheless, this is not a reality. Today on the island of Taiwan the worship of idols is still prevailing, whereas the gospel of the Lord is not. We have no way to gospelize Taiwan, not to mention truthizing it, because there has not been enough propagation and increase. It takes just four and a half hours to travel by train from Taipei to Kaohsiung. The distance between them is so short, and transportation is so convenient. In addition, many places are densely populated, and it is easy to contact people. However, we do not have much propagation and increase; we have failed the Lord and His gospel. Although there are more than five thousand saints who regularly attend the meetings in the church in Taipei, who love the Lord, and who offer much in the way of material offerings, there has been little spread. It is inexcusable that we are taking care of local needs only.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP&mdash;<br />
RECEIVING A BURDEN TO SPREAD ABROAD</h2>
<p>According to the history of the past two to three hundred years, one out of every twenty believers can be sent out for the gospel, while the remaining nineteen are responsible for supplying his material needs. If the condition of the church is very good, one out of every ten can be sent out. Recently, the elders in the churches in California met and fellowshipped, and they considered that since there are fifteen hundred saints there, one hundred fifty saints should migrate to other places, and that it would be best if they could support themselves financially. According to the principle of one out of every twenty, the church in Taipei, which has five thousand saints, should send out two hundred fifty saints. If each of the remaining saints would offer five percent of their income to supply the daily needs of those who are sent out for the gospel, there would be more than enough to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Perhaps you never had the thought that the church in Taipei should send people abroad to preach the gospel. On August 1, 1949, we formally started the work here. At that time, the meeting hall was very small, and we erected a shed outside. When we preached the gospel, there were so many people that there were not enough seats. So we bought some long wooden boards, placed some bricks on the ground, and put the boards on top for people to sit on. Even under these circumstances, we were able to lead quite a number of people to salvation. The church in Taipei has a history of over thirty-five years. It is really inexcusable for a church with such a long history to fail to send out one worker because it only cares to receive blessings for itself.</p>
<p>In the past the shortcoming of the church in Taipei could be seen in its meetings that would drag and often lack much content in terms of life and truth. At the last Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, however, all the prayers, testimonies, and fellowship were quite good. This proves that something has been wrought and constituted into the saints. Even the elderly saints who stood up to speak used precise words and cited proper references. Their speaking was weighty and full of life and truth. I am very happy about this. However, I also am sighing because we are not going out; we are not spreading. This is our present shortcoming. We have been richly endowed in that we have all the aspects of a good environment&mdash;public security, transportation, industry, agriculture, commerce, and education. We also have many spiritual riches. How long should we enjoy all these things before we are willing to go out?</p>
<p>Therefore, I would ask you to dream about this. Consider whether you should go abroad, perhaps to India, Burma, South America, or Africa. Even if your thoughts do not include places abroad, you should remember that there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan but only eighty local churches. There is no church in three quarters of the towns in Taiwan. God says that the earth needs to be filled, so we should fill every town in Taiwan. We have cared for ourselves but not for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony outside our locality; this is our greatest shortcoming. Furthermore, we have not multiplied much. In the first seven years the rate of increase of the church in Taipei was at least forty percent a year, but the annual rate of increase for the past twenty years is less than three percent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTED CHRIST<br />
WANTING HIS WITNESSES TO REACH<br />
THE UTTERMOST PART OF THE EARTH</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us emphasizes two things: knowing the truth and growing in life. However, we must realize that knowing the truth and growing in life are not for truth and life themselves but for the increase and spread of the church. Today we pay attention to the church only in the matters of knowing the truth and growing in life; we do not pay attention to the increase and spread of the church. Therefore, we have to study the book of Acts to check our condition, because the contents of this book concern the propagation, increase, and spread of the church. In reality, the increase and spread of the church are the increase and spread of Christ, because the church is Christ (1 Cor. 12:12).</p>
<p>The book of Acts provides us with a good pattern; it speaks of the propagation of the resurrected Christ in His ascension through the multiplication of His witnesses that reaches the uttermost part of the earth. In 1:8 the Lord said clearly to His disciples, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; To be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses is actually to be the Lord&rsquo;s propagation. This propagation needs to reach to the uttermost part of the earth. At this moment we do not need to talk about the uttermost part of the earth, because even India, Burma, and the Arabic-speaking countries, which are quite close to us, all need the Lord&rsquo;s propagation to reach them.</p><h2 class="head2">Through the Economical Spirit Whom the Lord Poured Out upon His Body in His Ascension</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation to the uttermost part of the earth is carried out through the economical Spirit, whom the Lord poured out upon His Body in His ascension (2:4, 17, 41, 47; 4:4, 31; 5:14; 6:7). Many Bible readers pay attention only to the receiving of power in the first part of Acts 1:8, but they overlook the part concerning being His witnesses. This part is related to being the Lord&rsquo;s propagation unto the uttermost part of the earth. The economical Spirit of power is not for our personal living and enjoyment but for God&rsquo;s economy. It is only when we enter into God&rsquo;s economy by going out to work for His economy that we can enjoy the economical Spirit. Therefore, if we continue to live a set and settled life, it will not be very easy to experience the outpouring of the economical Spirit. I absolutely believe that if some are willing to receive a burden to spread the Lord&rsquo;s propagation as His martyrs and witnesses, they will surely experience the economical Spirit being poured out upon them so that they can testify for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Announcing of the Gospel<br />
from House to House by the Believers</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation involves the believers meeting and announcing the gospel from house to house (5:42). Therefore, we must set up small groups. The gospel should be preached in every house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Prayer and<br />
the Ministry of the Word by the Apostles</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation also depends upon the apostles&rsquo; prayer and the ministry of the word (6:4). Although we pay considerable attention to truth and life, the responsible brothers and full-timers do not pray enough, and the words that are spoken are not rich enough. On the day of Pentecost three thousand people believed in the Lord and were saved because there was much prayer and the ministry of the word by the apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Scattering and Moving<br />
of the Believers</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation also occurs through the scattering and moving of the believers (8:1, 4). This is migration. It is not easy for people to move. Therefore, Acts 8 says that God raised up persecution in Jerusalem so that almost all the believers in Jerusalem were scattered to other places; only the apostles remained in Jerusalem. When the believers were scattered to other places, they brought the gospel with them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Traveling and Preaching<br />
of the Evangelists</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation was furthered by the traveling and preaching of the evangelists (vv. 5, 12, 26-30, 39-40). When Philip went out to preach the gospel, the Lord&rsquo;s angel was with him, and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit was also with him. The Lord&rsquo;s angel guided him, and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit spoke to him. Through this, the gospel spread greatly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Preaching of the Believers</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation involves the preaching of the believers (9:19-22, 28-29). Acts 9 records that right after Saul of Tarsus was saved, he started to preach that Jesus was the Christ. This is a good pattern to the believers. Saul was appointed as an apostle by God thirteen years after his salvation, but prior to this appointment he was a believer and a pattern to the believers. According to 1 Timothy 1:15-16, he considered himself the foremost of sinners, but he also recognized that the Lord had saved him to make him a pattern to the believers. Paul&rsquo;s pattern shows that once a person is saved, he should immediately preach Jesus to others; that is, he should speak of the One in whom he did not believe, whom he opposed, and whom he even slandered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Traveling and Preaching<br />
of the Apostles</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation is carried out through the traveling and preaching of the apostles (Acts 8:14, 25; 9:31-32). Although the apostles remained in Jerusalem, Peter, John, and others were sent out, and they traveled around without settling down in a particular place. Today many of our co-workers do not want to move once they have gone to a particular place. However, Peter still looked for opportunities to travel and to preach even though he bore important responsibilities in Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Specific Sending<br />
of the Apostles for the Work</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation was advanced by the specific sending of the apostles for the work, as recorded in Acts 13:2-3. When some prophets and teachers were praying and fasting in the church in Antioch, the Holy Spirit told them to set apart Barnabas and Saul and to send them out to do a specific work. Surely, this was not an easy thing to do at that time, but they went out boldly to preach. They first went to the synagogues of the Jews to speak to the Jews (v. 5; 14:1; 17:1-2), but later they turned to the Gentiles (13:46-48). This was not permitted by the customs and practices of the Jews, but the apostles went against their traditions and preached the gospel to the Gentiles.</p><h2 class="head2">Through Signs and Wonders</h2>
<p>To further the spread of His propagation and because of the faithfulness of the apostles, God caused signs and wonders to accompany them (2:43; 5:12, 15-16; 13:12; 19:11-12). We should be able to experience this. Those who go out from among us should have this same spirit of faith. This is not a matter of seeking for signs and wonders; rather, we should believe that signs and wonders from God will accompany us when necessary. Today signs and wonders do occur, but such signs and wonders are not the focus of our work; neither should we feel compelled to pretend or promote the false manifestation of such things, which is common in the Pentecostal movement. We do not have to pretend. Rather, we need to believe that our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; He has died on the cross for our sins. Today in resurrection He is able not only to cure sinners but also to cure those who are sick. We should have this kind of faith, and we should go out to work with the same faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Preaching of the Apostles</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s propagation is also accomplished through the preaching of the apostles. The apostles preached mainly three points. First, they preached the resurrected Christ in ascension (1:22; 2:24, 32-33; 3:15; 4:10-11; 5:30-32; 13:30; 17:31). In Acts, the apostles said repeatedly that they preached Jesus, the One who was killed by men but was raised from the dead by God, and that they were witnesses of His resurrection. The One they preached was the resurrected Jesus. Their working and preaching was a proof of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection; they were able to boldly preach that Jesus was resurrected because He was living inside them.</p>
<p>Second, the apostles preached the kingdom of God&mdash;the church (8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31). The kingdom of God is not a visible material kingdom but a kingdom of the divine life. This is Christ as life being spread to the believers, forming a realm in which God reigns in life. The apostles, especially Paul, repeatedly preached this item as the gospel, and at the same time they used this to exhort, encourage, and comfort the believers.</p>
<p>Third, the apostles preached the word concerning repentance, forgiveness of sins, and life (5:31; 13:38-39; 11:18). They spoke of man&rsquo;s sins and of the need to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus so that these sins would be forgiven and so that man might receive eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH<br />
AND GROWTH IN LIFE BEING FOR<br />
THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH,<br />
THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must learn from the teaching of the Bible to pay attention not only to the knowledge of the truth and growth in life but also to the increase and spread of the church. The increase and spread of the church are the goal of our knowing the truth and growing in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Apostles&rsquo; Teachings</h2>
<p>To keep the apostles&rsquo; teachings is to know the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Depending on the Word of God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>Believers should not only know the truth but also pursue the growth in life. To depend on the word of God&rsquo;s grace is to have the real growth in life through knowing the truth and by the grace of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Taught and Nurtured<br />
by the Apostles&rsquo; Epistles</h2>
<p>The apostles gave us a very good pattern. On one hand, they went out to work to establish churches, and on the other hand, they wrote letters, or Epistles, to the churches that they had raised up. Since they could not continually work in any one place, the Epistles were a means of teaching and nurturing the believers in every place. To teach is a matter of truth; to nurture is a matter of life.</p>
<p>There are several categories of Epistles written by the apostles. At the time of Paul&rsquo;s second ministry journey, in Acts 18:5 when Silas and Timothy came from Thessalonica to Corinth to see him, he wrote 1 Thessalonians. Not long after, he wrote 2 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>During Paul&rsquo;s second ministry journey, he also wrote the book of Galatians while he was in Corinth (cf. Acts 18:1-11; 16:6). This book is important because the believers in the churches in Galatia were unclear concerning the truth and misunderstood matters concerning life. Thus, Paul wrote the book of Galatians to render the proper teaching to the Galatian believers and to nurture them in the matter of life.</p>
<p>At the time of Paul&rsquo;s third ministry journey, he wrote 1 Corinthians while he was in Ephesus (Acts 19:22). Today 1 Corinthians is a tremendous help to us in the matters concerning truth and life. Later in this ministry journey Paul reached Macedonia, where he wrote 2 Corinthians.</p>
<p>When Paul stayed in Corinth during his third ministry journey (Acts 20:3), he also wrote the book of Romans. According to the record in Acts, Paul was very busy, and there were many burdens upon him. Amidst his busy work, however, he was able to take care of the churches that he could not visit by writing Epistles to teach and nurture them.</p>
<p>During his first imprisonment in Rome, Paul wrote four Epistles&mdash;Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon. After being released, he wrote 1 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews. These are all Epistles of considerable importance. During his second imprisonment, he wrote 2 Timothy. After writing 2 Timothy, he was ready to be martyred.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH TODAY NEEDING TO BE ADJUSTED</h2>
<p>Acts shows that there was much spreading in the early church, but in this spreading, the apostles did not forget the teaching of the truth and the nurturing in life. Regrettably, it seems that today we take care of only truth and life; we have not paid much attention to the increase and spread. Therefore, we need to be adjusted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Emphasizing the Church&rsquo;s Increase and Spread<br />
While Disregarding the Believers&rsquo;<br />
Knowledge of the Truth and Growth in Life<br />
Resulting in a Great Shortage</h2>
<p>If we emphasize the increase and spread of the church but disregard the believers&rsquo; knowledge of the truth and growth in life, the result will be a great shortage. The general practice of Christianity is to care only for spreading and evangelizing but not for truth, much less for life; this results in a great shortage.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Emphasizing the Believers&rsquo;<br />
Knowledge of the Truth and Growth in Life,<br />
While Neglecting the Church&rsquo;s Increase and Spread,<br />
Causing the Lord to Be Greatly Restricted</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, if we emphasize only the believers&rsquo; knowledge of the truth and growth in life but neglect the increase and spread of the church, we will greatly restrict the Lord. This word of balance should be applied to us. We have had a peaceful time here in Taiwan for over twenty years. In the first seven years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery here, there were only four hundred saints, and there was insufficient coordination. Yet we all were in one accord, and there was a great deal of increase and spread. In contrast, we have reached tens of thousands of people and our coordination is getting better, but we do not have much increase, not to mention much spread. This is really inexcusable. We must admit that we have greatly restricted the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Be Balanced</h2>
<p>We must be balanced. Surely, we have to pay attention to the knowledge of the truth and growth in life. At the same time, we need to realize that truth and life are for the increase and spread of the church. I hope that through this fellowship we will all turn. We need to know the truth more and to grow in life more. At the same time, we should also not neglect the increase and spread of the church.</p>
<p>In the past we promised and vowed that we would lead a person to the Lord each year. If we are faithful to the Lord, our number will certainly double in a year. If we spend time to recover the dormant ones, I believe that the number will double yet again. In this matter we need to be adjusted. I hope that during this period of time the Spirit of the Lord can operate among us in many ways so that there will be people who can receive the burden to go abroad to be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses for the Lord&rsquo;s propagation to spread to the uttermost part of the earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MEANS AND BASE<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we pointed out that the knowledge of the truth and growth in life are for the church&rsquo;s increase and spread. However, we also should realize that the increase and spread of the church are the increase and spread of Christ. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as a grain of wheat. As the only begotten Son of God, He was the one grain of wheat. When He went to the cross, He fell into the ground and died. Then in resurrection He produced much fruit, that is, many grains as the multiplication of Himself as the unique grain. <em>Much fruit</em> in verse 24 refers to those who believe into Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the only begotten Son of God became flesh, passed through human living, and died on the cross. After passing through death, He entered into resurrection to impart His divine life into those who believe into Him so that they could become many grains. Individually speaking, these grains are individual believers; collectively speaking, they are the one Body of Christ, the church.</p>
<p>Through the multiplication of Christ, He is both increased and spread. The increase and spread of the church is the increase and spread of Christ. Through His death and resurrection, Christ has been propagated, increased, and spread. Christ is present on every continent of the whole earth, and the expression of this spreading Christ is the church.</p>
<p>On the surface, the book of Acts is merely a record of the activities and work of the apostles. In actuality, it shows how the resurrected Christ in His ascension and by the Spirit of power has been multiplied continuously on the earth through His believers. This propagation begins in Acts 2, and it does not stop even at the end of chapter 28. Bible readers throughout history acknowledge that the book of Acts has no conclusion; it is a book that transcends time and space. Perhaps God in the heavens today looks upon the continuing acts of His disciples as further chapters in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>In the Gospels there was Jesus. Then in Acts 1 there were one hundred twenty believers in Jesus, each of whom was His increase. In this regard, the one Jesus was multiplied by one hundred twenty. In chapter 2 three thousand people were saved on the day of Pentecost (v. 41), bringing the number of Christ&rsquo;s multiplication to three thousand one hundred twenty-one. Then in chapter 4 another five thousand men were added (v. 4). In chapter after chapter of Acts there are the continuous increase and multiplication of Christ. In chapter 21, when Paul went up to Jerusalem, James said, &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed&rdquo; (v. 20). This means that by the time of chapter 21 the propagation of Christ had reached many thousands just in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The increase and spread did not begin with us; it began with Peter and continued with Paul. In Acts Peter, Paul, and all the other saints continuously propagated Christ so that Christ could be increased and spread on the earth. Today in the twentieth century there are genuine Christians in every large city of every continent on the earth. The number of those who have been washed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood, who have been regenerated with the divine life, and who have become members of Christ to be constituted as the Body of Christ is in the hundreds of millions. This is His propagation.</p>
<p>However, in comparison to the population in the world, the propagation of Christ is not enough. For example, the population of Taiwan is close to twenty million, but there are less than one million Christians in Taiwan. This is not even one-twentieth of the population. When the Lord&rsquo;s recovery first came to Taiwan in 1948 and 1949, there were meetings in only three to five places. Thirty-five years later there are more than eighty churches; nevertheless, there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan. In other words, we have spread only to one-quarter of the towns in Taiwan; three-quarters of the towns do not have the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. Therefore, Christ needs to multiply in Taiwan and to advance from multiplying to spreading.</p>
<p>Not long ago many of us made a vow before God that we would lead one person to the Lord in a year. This means that the Lord would double our number through propagation in one year. When we presented this consideration to the saints, we felt this was not much to ask since it should be easy to gain one person when we are daily involved in the burden and work of propagation. According to our experience with fruit trees, a tree that grows only one piece of fruit is rather unsightly.</p>
<p>If some saints have already borne one fruit, it would be good to bear even more. We should be able to bear fruit during each of the four seasons in a year. We also need to recover the saints who have not been meeting for a long time, even those with whom we have lost contact. We have heard many testimonies of how some of those who have not been meeting with us for a while have been revived and recovered through the small group meetings. Such a fourfold propagation would truly make this a year of propagation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANS OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;S<br />
INCREASE AND SPREAD IN ACTS</h2>
<p>The book of Acts not only records the facts related to the church&rsquo;s increase and spread; it also shows four important means of the church&rsquo;s increase and spread. The first means is the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, descending on the lovers of the Lord (1:8; 2:2-4). The second means is prayer, which is continued steadfastly (6:4; 1:14; 2:42). The third means is God&rsquo;s word (6:7), which is Christ Himself. God&rsquo;s word has power, because the word of God is life, light, and truth. As such, it brings salvation to man. We do not preach ourselves or philosophy, and even more, not ethics or theories; we preach and release the word of God. The fourth means is the believers&rsquo; homes; this is the practical means for God&rsquo;s increase and spread. Acts does not contain a record concerning meetings in a chapel, but there is a record of meeting &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; The believers broke bread and prayed together from house to house (2:46). They also announced the gospel and taught Jesus as the Christ from house to house (5:42). Finally, Paul spoke of teaching and admonishing the believers from house to house (20:20).</p>
<p>The means for God&rsquo;s spread is through His Spirit, by the prayer of the believers, by the release of God&rsquo;s word, and through the believers&rsquo; homes. These four aspects occupy a very important position in Acts. In addition to these four aspects, we need to be His witnesses. In 1:8 the Lord clearly said, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; <em>Witness</em> in Greek means &ldquo;martyr,&rdquo; one who lays down his life, who pays the price of his life, to be a witness.</p>
<p>Peter, James, and John were the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. They testified not only by their words but also by their living; eventually, they testified even with their lives. Each one was a martyr. Every witness should be a martyr. In order for God to have a way to propagate, we must have the spirit of a martyr, willing to sacrifice everything, offer everything, and even lose our lives to testify for Christ.</p>
<p>Through these five means in Acts, there was a continuous increase and spread of Christ. The Lord can have a way on the earth only through the Spirit of God, through the prayer of the saints, through God&rsquo;s word, through the believers&rsquo; homes, and through living witnesses who are martyrs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVALUATING THE STATISTICS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Now we need to fellowship concerning the statistics of the church in Taipei and evaluate them in light of our condition. It has been thirty-six years since the church in Taipei was established in 1948. Today there are many young people, all below the age of thirty-five. For this we are truly happy. Even though the older saints are very precious, the young saints are more important. Every successful business relies on young people because they are the ones who are able to move forward. In this respect, the church in Taipei is a moving church; it is normal in many aspects, and it is full of vitality. Regrettably, it is not normal enough, because there is almost no increase. This is quite painful to me.</p>
<p>When the church in Taipei began to meet, there were only twenty to thirty people. Not long afterward, Brother Chang Wu-chen and others contacted me and then came here. Thereafter, the number increased gradually. In April or May of the following year, I also came here. At that time the church was meeting in a Japanese-style house on Shanghai Road.</p>
<p>Later I spent some time traveling south by train from Taipei, visiting the saints who were scattered in various places along the way. After this time of visitation I realized that the Lord had a way to go on, even though the saints were scattered throughout Taiwan. After returning to Taipei, we decided to officially start the work on August 1, 1949.</p>
<p>At that time there were between three and five hundred brothers and sisters in Taiwan. The meetings of the church in Taipei included seventy to eighty saints. With these saints as a base, our numbers increased to three thousand over the next six years. We had an annual rate of increase of over one hundred percent. Even when counting all the saints in the churches on the island, we still had a forty percent annual rate of increase.</p>
<p>Three thousand saints is a conservative number. In the past thirty-five years more than fifty-seven thousand information cards have been filled out by saints in the church in Taipei. In 1956 there were approximately thirteen thousand eight hundred. In other words, the church in Taipei included over thirteen thousand saints in 1956. Although we had a large number of people on record, a smaller number regularly attended the meetings. In particular, the church in Taipei was well known for its high percentage of absent saints. In times of good attendance, approximately one-third would come to the meetings. At other times, only twenty-five percent would come. Thus, the actual number of regular attendees, those who were solidly in the church life, was about three thousand in Taipei in 1956. Nevertheless, the rate of increase was very high in the first five to six years.</p>
<p>Since 1956 to 1984, this base number of three thousand has remained fairly constant. While we do not need annual rates of increase that equal our early years, we do need to increase. Even a twenty percent rate of increase would be commendable. However, over the past twenty-eight years we have not even reached this standard; this exposes a great shortcoming.</p>
<p>I regret very much that I did not pay attention to our statistics when I came back over ten years ago. If we had paid attention to them, perhaps we could have redeemed much time. For many years the number of people attending the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting in the church in Taipei has averaged about three thousand one hundred. On the most recent Lord&rsquo;s Day, however, there were about three thousand five hundred, an increase of four hundred. This increase reflects the impact of beginning to once again meet in small groups, which has brought in some new ones and recovered some dormant saints.</p>
<p>The actual number of saints in the church life in Taipei may be closer to five thousand five hundred. But even if this is the case, the number of those in the normal church life in Taipei has increased only from three thousand to five thousand five hundred in a span of almost twenty-eight years. This is an average annual rate of increase of less than three percent. This is truly not justifiable.</p>
<p>Even though we have lost contact with some saints in the last twenty-eight years due to moving, emigration, and death, we have also baptized at least ten thousand people and possibly as many as forty thousand. According to our observations, we have not lost contact with many as a result of moving, and at most, five thousand have emigrated. In addition, the increasing life expectancy in Taiwan has limited our losses due to death. This indicates that we have a high rate of those who are simply absent from the meetings. We cannot comfort ourselves with excuses; rather, we should locate the source of our problem.</p><h2 class="head1">REFOCUSING ON OUR PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>This is a family matter and a family discussion. In 1980 I began to notice that the condition of the church in Taipei was at a standstill. Whenever I saw the responsible brothers, I would raise this issue and say, &ldquo;The church in Taipei should not be like this, having no advancement at all. Just like a boat that is in a current, the church will either advance or be pushed back; the church must always advance.&rdquo; I have been concerned about this situation for four years, but due to many burdens I have not been able to do anything. Therefore, after finishing the work of the New Testament footnotes and the Life-study messages in October of last year, I decided to return to Taiwan immediately.</p>
<p>Before the Lord I decided to pay attention to the work in the way that I did in 1949 when I began the work in Taiwan with the brothers. Thus, as soon as I returned to Taiwan, I began to pay attention to the matter of statistics. In order to do anything in society today, we cannot neglect statistics. Furthermore, with over thirty years of history, we can more easily locate the source of our problem, based on our history.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, the condition of the church in Taipei, whether in terms of the number of people or the meetings, is second to none. For this we worship the Lord. However, we must study why we had an annual rate of increase of one hundred percent from 1949 to 1956, but less than three percent since then. Through our lack of attention to the matter of statistics, we missed an opportunity to see our lack. Therefore, we must rise up and once again pay attention to our statistics so that we can make a correction.</p>
<p>According to the information cards, over forty thousand people have been baptized in the past twenty-eight years, but the number of people meeting has increased by only two thousand five hundred. This indicates that most of the believers that we baptized do not meet with us. There is no need to blame anyone for this, but this is a fact that we cannot deny. Actually, we all are responsible for this situation, but those of us who take the lead in the work must bear more of the responsibility. Our way has been wrong because we have ignored our statistics.</p>
<p>Today, regardless of whether one is operating a business, a government agency, or a school, there is always a set of accounts for each year. From these accounts, statistics can be derived in order to evaluate and make improvements. However, we have neglected statistics for more than ten years. This allowed us to be content with our condition because the church in Taipei was larger than churches in other cities. However, once we began to look at the statistics, we discovered that our condition has not advanced much over the last twenty-eight years. There has not been much increase, because we did not utilize our family assets appropriately.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel quite well; otherwise, forty thousand people would not have been baptized. On average, we baptize one thousand five hundred people every year. According to statistics, many have been &ldquo;born,&rdquo; but almost as many have &ldquo;died.&rdquo; The average life expectancy of a person in Taiwan is over seventy years, but our spiritual life expectancy may be less than seven years. If we had statistics on the spiritual life expectancy of the saints, I am afraid that it would be quite short. Our negligence of statistics has kept us from formulating a way to deal with our situation. We need to find a way to correct our current situation.</p>
<p>There are mainly three categories of people who have neglected these statistics. The first category includes just myself, because even though I lived overseas, I still bear some responsibility. Further, I have fellowshipped with the brothers often and even returned to Taiwan often; therefore, it is difficult to avoid blame. The second and third categories are the co-workers and the elders. We neglected our statistics and did not formulate a way to properly respond to the facts revealed by these statistics. This is because we were satisfied with the number of saints who were in the meetings. Consequently, we simply muddled along day by day. But many years have passed with no change, and in looking back, we realize that we have gained very little increase.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASE FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
ESTABLISHING SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Small Groups Being Able to Retain People</h2>
<p>The first practice that we did not carry out in a proper way relates to the small groups. From 1949 to 1956, our average annual rate of increase was mainly attributable to the formation of small groups. We gained people through the preaching of the gospel, and we retained people by meeting with them in small groups. If a mother continuously gives birth to children but has no place where they can be safeguarded, nurtured, and educated, there will be many premature deaths in her family. This is the main factor in our negligence over the past twenty-eight years. We preached the gospel constantly. The co-workers and elders were busy every day for twenty-eight years, bringing in forty-five thousand people to be baptized. Yet we did not pay attention to how to keep them, and thus, most of them have been lost. If the elders had paid attention and done a thorough job evaluating the information cards, they would not have allowed this kind of situation to persist for so long.</p>
<p>We are like broken cisterns, which cannot hold water (Jer. 2:13). We are continually drawing water, but we are letting it leak away. After drawing water for twenty-eight years, we still do not have much water. We should repair the &ldquo;cistern&rdquo; so that we can retain at least half of those who are baptized. If we would have been able to retain twenty thousand out of forty thousand people who were baptized over the past twenty-eight years, we would be in a most wonderful and encouraging situation.</p>
<p>I have no intention of rebuking anyone. If I were to rebuke, I would rebuke myself the most. Rebuking is useless; our goal is to find a remedy. In our early years we benefited greatly from the small groups. Regrettably, after 1956 we suffered a great loss after inviting a &ldquo;spiritual giant&rdquo; to &ldquo;help&rdquo; us, and our way of small groups was torn down. After 1956 the small groups ceased to function even though we did not officially announce that we would put aside the small groups.</p>
<p>Without the small groups, there was no container to hold the water. Consequently, the water that was drawn was poured onto the ground, and it seeped back into the soil. When we discovered that we were low on water, we went to the &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; well again to draw water, but the water that we drew was also poured onto the ground. For over twenty-eight years we have repeated this pattern: preaching the gospel, baptizing those who are saved, and then pouring them back onto the ground. As a result, almost everyone who has been saved has seeped back into the ground. This is like having a back door that is wider than our front door; people can leave faster than they enter. We have been satisfied for the past twenty-eight years because we have looked only at those who are coming in through the front door, but we have failed to notice that almost all of them have left through the back door. This is the result of our neglect of the small groups.</p>
<p>The purpose of my continuous talk about statistics is to help us understand the means and base for the increase and spread of Christ. These statistics can point us in the proper direction to find the means and base. For the past twenty-eight years, we have not had a proper base. Whenever a person builds a house, the first thing is to build a foundation as a base. For twenty-eight years we have been building, but it has not been on a firm base. This base is the small groups. By 1980 all the small groups were gone. In place of the small groups, there were big joint meetings, mass gatherings, and meetings involving one man speaking. This was a return to the old condition of Christianity.</p>
<p>The main method for bringing people into the Catholic Church is not gospel gatherings. One rarely sees the Catholic Church advertise a gospel gathering; their main method is personal contact and personal support. Even though Catholicism is full of heresies, their methods are superior. The Protestant denominations have more truth, but their methods are very traditional. They rely only on large gatherings, and they hire well-educated and eloquent speakers who know how to contact others, using their social and psychological skills. The success or failure of such methods depends upon one person.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are no &ldquo;chapels.&rdquo; In the early days the believers met frequently in the temple of Judaism, but this practice did not please the Lord, because it brought a mixture of Judaism into the New Testament church. This mixture reached its climax in Acts 21 when Paul was almost caught in a trap of offering sacrifices. Actually, he had been in the temple for six days, and he was waiting for the seventh day when the priest would complete the offering of sacrifices for him and for those on whose behalf he had paid the expenses. However, the Lord did not allow this to happen; He raised up a confrontation to deliver Paul out of this situation of confusion. The Lord delivered him not only from the rioting of the Jews but also from the mixture of Judaism with the New Testament church.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the meetings of the church in Acts occurred mainly &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; The saints went from one house to another, house after house. This is the correct meaning of <em>from house to house</em> in Greek. Even if a house was large, it would not have been able to accommodate a mass gathering. At the most, it would have been able to provide a place for immediate neighbors; the capacity of a house is always small. This is the reason that we refer to such meetings as small group meetings.</p>
<p>In 1922 we began establishing churches in mainland China, starting in Foochow in the south. In 1932 the church in Chefoo was established in the north. Altogether we had twenty-seven years of history. In that period of time we did not encounter any great needs related to size. The number of people in the church in a locality rarely reached one thousand. Chefoo reached close to one thousand, and Shanghai eventually reached about one thousand seven hundred. During this time, if there was a need, we met in separate meeting halls, calling them districts. This was our practice before coming to Taiwan.</p>
<p>After coming to Taiwan, the number of people increased so quickly in the first six years that even separate districts were inadequate for our needs. After some study, the districts were divided into groups that met in homes. Our initial plan was to have fifteen to twenty people in a group, but because of the unexpected rate of increase, a group often reached eighty to one hundred people. We could not divide the groups fast enough. Sadly, after 1956 the negative influence that we received caused us to neglect the practice of meeting in small groups in the homes. From then on we went further and further toward the way of having joint meetings of all the saints in a hall and of assigning speakers; this took us back to the old ways of Christianity, which relies on preachers rather than the saints. This was a mistake.</p>
<p>Now we must rise up in order to catch up, turning our attention away from joint meetings with individual speakers to the small groups. The co-workers and the elders have all agreed to divide the saints in the church in Taipei into about four hundred groups. There are currently about three hundred sixty groups exercising in this way, and even in a short period of time four to five hundred dormant saints have been recovered. This is only the beginning. From now on we must pay attention to recovering the practice of the small groups. We must practice the small groups and actively seek to bring the small groups into function even more.</p>
<p>Our initial hope is that each group would not be too large in number. Twelve is a good number, but if it reaches fifteen to sixteen, it should be split into two groups. The smaller the number of people, the more effective is the function of the small group. With this focus there is no need for a so-called responsible one or leader in a group; rather, every member of the small group can equally function. We must definitely raise the level of function in the small groups. For example, after preaching the gospel and leading people to be baptized, we do not need to focus on getting the new ones to a big meeting; instead, we can hand them over to a small group to be taken care of practically.</p><h2 class="head2">Small Groups Being<br />
in the Nature of Home Nurturing,<br />
Whereas Joint Meetings Being<br />
in the Nature of School Education</h2>
<p>In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, the most essential component is the need for strong family units. A family unit will produce and nurture strong, healthy descendants who will be strong citizens of a country. Without sufficiently strong families, there will be weak citizens of a weak country. This principle is the same for the church; if a family is not strong, it will be difficult for the saints to be strong.</p>
<p>In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, another essential component is the need for a matching system of education. Homes are for nurturing, and schools are for educating. Both of these components are necessary. Therefore, after studying our situation, we realize that there is still a need for joint meetings in the church life, which are in the nature of school education, and for small group meetings, which are in the nature of home nurturing. When the citizens of a nation have proper nurturing in the homes plus a good education at school, its young people will grow spontaneously to become strong citizens who will make the nation powerful and prosperous. The church also has a need for proper nurturing in the &ldquo;family&rdquo; units of the small groups and, at the same time, for gathering together in joint meetings from once a week to at least once a month. During these times, there should be some education in the truth, which is in the nature of a school.</p>
<p>From now on we should stress both sides because everything needs two sides in order to go forward with balance. For example, a person with only one leg has difficulty walking, and a person with one eye has difficulty seeing. In order for a church to go on in a good way, there must be home nurturing and school education. In other words, we must have small group meetings for home nurturing, and we must also have joint meetings to educate in the truth. In the past we relied only on joint meetings and neglected the nurturing in the homes; consequently, many people did not remain. In other words, without the &ldquo;family&rdquo; units in the homes, our newborn children were not nurtured and could not grow. We must recover the small groups and build them up as the base of our increase and spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Small Groups Being the Genuine Base<br />
for the Church&rsquo;s Increase and Spread</h2>
<p>Forming small groups has another advantage of not needing additional large facilities. If the Lord blesses us in our pursuit of our vow to bring one person to the Lord in the coming year, we will double in number. Furthermore, if we continue to recover the saints who have not been meeting for some time, the number in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting in the church in Taipei will surpass ten thousand. If we are dependent upon big meetings, where could these people meet? We would not be able to keep up with the need even if we immediately began to build new meeting halls. However, if our homes are the base, whether or not we have a meeting hall will not be a problem. Even without a meeting hall, people can meet in homes and receive care. But if there are no homes, many people will have no place to go.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot rely solely on the big meetings; instead, we must rely on the small groups. If there are five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, there needs to be at least five hundred small groups; if the number of people meeting increases to ten thousand, then we need to form one thousand small groups. In principle, the number of homes and the formation of small groups should increase proportionately to the increase in the number of people. In this way, with or without meeting halls, we can still have the church life and take care of people. As long as we have homes as our base and set them up well, all our basic problems can be addressed. Even if we have no &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for higher education, we can provide a general education, even if it is at a high school level. Therefore, our first responsibility is to recover the small groups and to make them more effective than before.</p>
<p>I hope that all of us would be impressed deeply and receive this fellowship. This is not for others but for us so that all our homes can be opened &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; This is the means and the base for the increase and spread of the church. Once this way is established, even denominational groups in Christianity will adopt this way. Today Christianity is not flourishing because they rely on big meetings and on one preacher or pastor. Although this is better than nothing, it is not the proper way. The proper way involves small groups. Once small groups are established, there will be the increase.</p><h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUPS&mdash;<br />
THE MEETINGS FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h2>
<p>Based on Acts 2:46, 5:42, and 20:20, small groups met from house to house. These three verses show that the church life of the saints in Jerusalem was mainly in the homes; the homes were the base. They broke bread, prayed, taught the truth, and preached the gospel from house to house. This is not something we invented; we discovered this by reading the Bible, and now we are presenting it to you. Since the Bible speaks of these four things, we should study how to break bread, pray, teach the truth, and preach the gospel from house to house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING STATISTICS AND HAVING A PLAN<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>From now on, we should use our statistics to understand our true situation more clearly. With these statistics we can make a plan. A plan involves more than a vow. Nothing can be done in a good way without a plan. Government organizations and large companies all have a business plan, but even a family or a single person should have a plan. A college student should not be impulsive; rather, he should know when he will graduate, when he should begin to look for a job, how much his monthly income should be, and how much money he can spend each month. If he does not have a plan, it will be easy to buy things that he cannot afford.</p>
<p>While we need a budget plan for income and expenses, we should also have a budget for our life. A person who desires to be married should have a &ldquo;marriage budget,&rdquo; that is, a consideration of things such as when to get married and the level of education and age of his or her spouse. Once there is the budget plan, he or she should pray earnestly, &ldquo;Lord, by Your mercy I am standing here today. I need a spouse who at least has a college education and who is within five years of my age. Lord, may You bestow grace upon me.&rdquo; We should all have a plan and pray to the Lord earnestly.</p>
<p>In the same principle, if we want the church to increase and spread, we must have a plan. If our plan is to have an annual increase equal to one hundred percent, doubling every year, then we will reach three hundred twenty-five thousand in six years. If we plan for a fifty percent increase, we will reach a similar number in ten years. Since any plan involves the church corporately, every member must contribute his or her part, including how many people to bring to the Lord each year and how to bring them in. Everything should be planned; we should not lack focus, expressing agreement with the church but returning home to sleep in peace. Without a plan we will not have even a one percent increase. The church must have a corporate plan, and the saints must have a personal plan.</p>
<p>The personal plan must be very practical and specific. For example, in a thorough consideration before the Lord, you can draw up a list of names of relatives and friends. You can narrow it down to a few who could be saved and then make them your target, praying for them specifically. You must pray until you even dream about them. If you have time to write letters, you can write to them or send them a few verses. After months of prayer, consideration, and contact, you will gain them as fellow believers.</p>
<p>A young person can consider his schoolmates and think about how to pray for them, how to speak to them concerning the gospel, and how to lead them and invite them to a home. Even if they are annoyed with you, you should still seek them out. Eventually, there will be a few who will listen, receive the gospel, and believe. We know of many stories like this. We can apply this way not only to relatives, friends, and schoolmates but also to colleagues and neighbors. When we make a plan in these areas, we need to be like a person planning to open a restaurant. He needs to consider how to attract customers, including whether he should distribute leaflets to his neighbors to notify them or to invite relatives and friends for a free meal. He cannot wait until the restaurant opens and then go to the roadside to notify people. In the universe, only God can produce something out of nothing. Since we are not God, we cannot expect instant, but unplanned, results. Therefore, we need a plan. Since we all agree that the church should have an increase equal to one hundred percent, each of us should go home and make a proper plan.</p>
<p>One day you and I will all stand before the Lord, and I believe at that time the Lord will ask each one of us a question based on John 15: &ldquo;Did you bear any fruit? How much fruit did you bear?&rdquo; How will we answer? It is not a miracle but a duty for a tree to bear fruit, because of the laws of nature. The people in the charismatic movement superstitiously believe in miracles, thinking that if they pray to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will be poured down and many people will be saved instantly. Actually, the number of people who are saved through the charismatic movement and who remain is very small because they do not work according to the &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; revealed in the Bible. The Bible speaks of the believers as being branches of the vine; branches bear fruit as a matter of nature, not as a consequence of miracles.</p>
<p>The Lord in whom we believe is real and living; He does not act on superstitious impulses. We should act according to His word because we will be accountable to Him based on His word. He said, &ldquo;You are the branches...In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&rdquo; (vv. 5, 8). How can He be pleased if we bear no fruit? I implore you to earnestly consider this message and to have a plan before the Lord. We all need to say, &ldquo;Lord, my past days have been consumed by locusts. Forgive me. I pray that You will have mercy on me; redeem this year for me so that I can bear at least two fruit.&rdquo; This is not such a difficult matter. May the Lord have mercy on us. The aggregate sum of each of our plans will enable the number of people to double or even triple. In this way the church will surely increase, spread, and flourish.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
ACCORDING TO LAW</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A PLAN BASED ON ACTUAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>We must have a proper understanding regarding the making of a plan. Effective plans are based on actual resources. For example, the production of goods is determined by the resources that are available to make it. For example, a farmer does not develop a plan to grow certain crops out of thin air. His plan is based on the amount of farmland he has, his manpower, his time, and his finances. He must base his plan on the actual condition of his land, manpower, time, and finances. Every line of business faces these same considerations; that is, a business must make a reasonable plan based on the availability of actual resources.</p>
<p>The increase of the church does not depend upon organization. Its resources are related to life, not to organizational structure. Nevertheless, without planning, life alone will not produce the maximum results. Although we have emphasized life over the past twenty-eight years, our annual rate of increase has been less than three percent. The issue of our emphasis on life has been limited because we have had no accompanying plan. A farmer who does not know the acreage of his farmland, the level of his manpower, the availability of his time, or the extent of his finances will not reap the same benefit as a farmer who does have a plan. Even a farmer with significant resources will not obtain maximum results without a plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEEMING THE TIME</h2>
<p>A plan for the increase and spread of the church will ensure that we redeem the time. Ephesians 5:15-17 says, &ldquo;Not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&rdquo; The best way to redeem the time is to follow a schedule. If a person desires to obtain the most benefit from his education, he needs to follow a schedule so that time is not wasted. As human history developed, an educational system also was developed, beginning with kindergarten and advancing through elementary school, junior high school, high school, college, and graduate school. Every country in the world, almost without exception, follows such a system, because through experience this system has been proven to be effective.</p>
<p>Private education in China in the past typically involved one person teaching a group of children to recite ancient literature. There was not much educational advancement with this method because the classes consisted primarily of memorization, recitation, and some writing. However, educational methods have changed, and now most countries follow a schedule that goes from kindergarten to graduate school. This system helps to redeem the time. Without this system, a person could be in school for many years and not advance very much.</p>
<p>In the past twenty-eight years we have been speaking of truth and life in a general way, yet even now many people cannot speak some basic truths. This shows that our way needs to be improved. Over three thousand &ldquo;students&rdquo; have been meeting several times a week, but when they speak on the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, the cross, and the breaking of the flesh, it is as if they are like the students who recite ancient literature. After twenty-eight years I am concerned that we do not have many elementary school graduates, much less university graduates. An elementary school graduate at least understands some basic arithmetic, but many saints among us cannot speak even a basic word on the truth of justification, sanctification, or redemption. This shows that our time needs to be redeemed by using a schedule.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INCLUDING A SCHEDULE IN A PROPER PLAN</h2>
<p>Some sisters are housewives, and after seeing their children off to school and their husbands off to work, their main responsibilities relate to household matters. If these sisters do not have a schedule to complete the things that need to be done during the day, they can easily waste time and accomplish nothing. Similarly, it is difficult to read the Bible consistently without a schedule. Even though we love the Lord very much, there are only twenty-four hours in a day. If we are busy with other things and do not have a scheduled time to read the Bible, we will not be able to find the time to read the Bible. If we love the Lord, we should live to the Lord by making a schedule; otherwise, our day will pass by in a flash, and before the Lord, we will regret our failure to redeem the time.</p>
<p>We must consider our physical condition when we set up a schedule for work and rest. If a person is not healthy, he must care for his body for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and set aside sufficient time for rest. Then everything else that needs to be done in a day should be included in a schedule, including reading newspapers. In this way we will have time to read the Bible, pray, and serve the Lord. Without a schedule we will read the Bible unceasingly when we are happy and put the Bible aside when we are not happy. It is difficult to work with a person who is controlled by his moods rather than a schedule, and even his completed work is not helpful because it has been done improperly. A person who cannot get things done properly cannot serve the Lord.</p>
<p>When I first began to serve the Lord, I was very busy and I frequently received letters. However, I often had little time to reply because I did not know how to arrange my time. When I was able to reply, I would begin by apologizing for not writing sooner. At first my conscience was not bothered by this, but the more I repeated this excuse, the more my conscience was bothered. One day I asked myself, &ldquo;Were you really busy, or did you just not arrange your time well? If you were &lsquo;busy&rsquo; only because you did not manage your time, you are lying.&rdquo; After this, whenever I was late in replying to a letter, I could only say, &ldquo;I am sorry for not replying until now.&rdquo; Even though this was an honest word, I still was not truly peaceful because a late reply is never good. This is an example of our need to schedule everything in a proper way.</p>
<p>I believe many saints have had similar experiences. For example, if we decide to read a certain number of chapters in the Bible every day, but do not set a schedule, we will soon stop reading the Bible. Although we can excuse ourselves by saying that we have been busy, the real reason is that we have not set a schedule to manage our time. When we have a schedule, there will always be time to read the Bible.</p>
<p>Often we see sisters running to the meeting in a rush because they love the Lord and do not want to be late. But since they love the Lord, they should not waste time, and then there would be no need to rush. They rush to a meeting because they have no schedule, and then they linger long after a meeting because they have no schedule. This shows our need to redeem the time according to Ephesians 5:16. Redeeming the time involves scheduling our time. We need to consider our use of time and make a schedule; otherwise, we will lose many opportunities to redeem the time. A schedule enables us to seize our time and redeem it.</p>
<p>Schools set a schedule and have a system so that students will not waste time. A school schedule involves the number of days in a week, semester, and year; the number of hours per day and the length of time for each course, which is usually fifty minutes with a ten minute break between classes for each course; and the number of hours required for study at home. All students are given this schedule and are expected to follow it. They cannot come to school late simply because they had only a few hours of sleep; they must get up at six o&rsquo;clock every morning, arrive at school by seven-thirty, and begin classes exactly at eight o&rsquo;clock. By following this schedule day after day, week after week, they gradually learn. Thus, they learn to redeem the time.</p>
<p>Many young people can follow a schedule when they are in school, but once they graduate, they become loose. I know of a young sister who kept a schedule quite diligently when she was in school, but after graduation she was unable to get out of bed to go to the meetings. During winter and summer breaks many students do not rest according to a schedule; as a result, time flies away. If we truly love the Lord, we must have a plan and a schedule for our time.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION BEING ACCORDING TO A SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation is based on a schedule. The phrase <em>there was evening and there was morning</em> is used repeatedly in the record of God&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31). This refers to a schedule in God&rsquo;s creation. God did not use His almighty power as an excuse to not keep a schedule. God did not create the heavens and the earth and then relax and wait for a good mood to create the animals. If God&rsquo;s creation occurred in such a casual manner, how many days would it have taken Him to create all things?</p>
<p>If we read the Bible carefully, we will acknowledge that the first One who kept a schedule was our God. He is the almighty One, but He is not loose or careless in regard to time. He created according to a precise schedule of six days; moreover, these days were evenly divided into evening and morning. Every evening includes twelve hours, and every morning includes twelve hours. God&rsquo;s work of creation was done according to a schedule.</p>
<p>Our efforts to keep a schedule cannot match God&rsquo;s ability, because He is able to &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; every second. One of the primary requirements of the training is that people would be in their seats five minutes prior to the scheduled time of a meeting. This speaks of our need to keep a scheduled time. Some people think that it is easy to arrive on time, but this is not the case. Although we desire to arrive five minutes early for the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we often arrive late. The training surely has helped because often fewer than twenty, and sometimes no one, arrive late to a meeting now. The trainees are not late because they must follow the training&rsquo;s schedule, not their own schedule. If a trainee was able to set his own schedule, he would change the meeting time from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning to ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning so that he could sleep longer. The training also set a rule that whoever arrives late three times will be dismissed automatically. Therefore, all the participants in the training dare not arrive late; they come to meetings in fear and trembling. Even traffic conditions are not an excuse for arriving late. Even though it takes thirty minutes to get to the meeting under normal traffic conditions, there is always the possibility of encountering a traffic jam. Thus, the trainees learn to leave their homes earlier in case they encounter a traffic jam. There is a need for guidelines and limitations because our human nature is so degraded. A schedule provides us with some of these needed guidelines.</p>
<p>God relied upon a schedule in His creation, and even the things He created follow a schedule. For example, human beings are born after nine months of pregnancy according to a schedule, and the harvesting of fruit is according to a schedule. These schedules are set by God. He does not allow freedom to produce chaos. The universe exists because God&rsquo;s creation operates according to a schedule. If the earth did not orbit the sun according to a set schedule, it would be impossible to sustain life on earth. The universe has order because God has set a schedule. We are God&rsquo;s children, and as imitators of God (Eph. 5:1), we should have a schedule related to all matters. Without a schedule, time slips away. In order to redeem the time, we must have a schedule.</p>
<p>Young people often work unceasingly without rest, but when they are finished with their work, they want to sleep unceasingly. Such a pattern of work will not lead to success. People who are successful schedule their time for working, eating, exercising, and resting. It is the same with spiritual matters. We need to read a set number of chapters or verses in the Bible at a set time in order to maintain this necessary spiritual practice. We should not read a large number of chapters when we are happy but nothing at all when we are unhappy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ILLUSTRATION OF BEARING FRUIT<br />
ACCORDING TO A SET TIME&mdash;THE VINE</h2>
<p>Since we love the Lord, we should keep His laws. In the Gospel of John, the Lord likened Himself to a vine and us to branches (15:1, 5). According to God&rsquo;s law, a vine bears fruit according to a schedule. When I was small, the courtyard of our house contained a small vineyard, and I was able to watch the grapes grow throughout the year. After several years I realized that the vine produced fruit according to a schedule. In spring the vine would sprout, flower, and produce grapes at nearly the same time every year.</p>
<p>Today we are branches in the vine, the Lord. Therefore, our ability to bear fruit is unrelated to our mood. We should bear fruit according to a set time. It is a mistake to rely on mood, and it is not enough to know about truth and life if we do not have a schedule for bearing fruit. We must repent of this and pray.</p><h2 class="head1">CARRYING OUT THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING ACCORDING TO A SET TIME</h2>
<p>Real increase is a matter of law. As branches of the Lord, bearing fruit is also a matter of law. The schedule is the law. A vine&rsquo;s fruit is not an issue of the mood of the vine, and neither is it the product of a spontaneous miracle. A vine bears fruit according to the law of its life, which is fully related to a schedule. For example, an almond tree bears fruit in the spring, whereas grapes ripen in autumn. The law of the almond trees and the law of the grape vine operate according to set times. As members of the Body of Christ, our increase and propagation are also according to the law of the divine life.</p>
<p>I hope this point will be clear to us. We cannot merely make a vow before the Lord and proclaim that we will bear fruit next year. This is not a reliable way; the most reliable way is for us to live in Christ in reality as His branches. Then the law of His life in us will enable us to bear fruit. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the operation of the law of life in us relieves us of all our responsibility. The effective operation of the law of life requires a certain amount of cooperation (Rom. 8:2, 4).</p>
<p>I have planted some fruit trees and other plants in the front yard of my house. On the one hand, I see that every plant flowers and bears fruit at a set time. On the other hand, these times are affected by loosening the soil, watering, and adding fertilizer at set times. Overwatering can kill a tree, and insufficient watering can hinder the growth of a tree. Life is according to law, but the growth of life requires cooperation. When there is proper cooperation, much fruit can be borne. Thus, we must all learn to responsibly cooperate with the law of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>Consider a saint who is convinced that zealousness for the Lord involves constant participation in every activity of a local church. From 1936 to 1938, I was living in Tiantsin, but I was also taking care of the church in Beijing. At that time there was a sister in Beijing whose husband was a professor at the university. One day she became quite stirred up for the Lord and began coming to the meeting hall every day. She would leave home in the morning with her Bible bag and not return until eleven o&rsquo;clock at night. She entrusted her children to a nanny and completely neglected her housework. She justified her behavior by saying that anyone who stayed home did not love the Lord and that anyone who took care of their family and children before the Lord loved the world. This put a great strain on her marriage, and all of the saints were concerned for her.</p>
<p>Although life grows, there must also be a proper cooperation related to the outward environment. Some saints do not bear fruit because they do not go to the meetings to receive the supply, and others do not bear fruit because, even though they go to every meeting, they receive no supply. The sister in Beijing went to every meeting, but she did not bear any fruit. Her willingness to ignore the needs of her home, her children, and her husband also created problems for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. Her husband was so unhappy that he said to the saints, &ldquo;If this is what happens when a person believes in Jesus, I will never believe in Him.&rdquo; Her husband thought that her behavior was the result of our teaching. In response, we voiced our concerns to him and exhorted the sister to stay at home more. Only then was he comforted.</p>
<p>This is a common experience among us. Either we do not do anything, or we become so zealous that we cannot stop. Doing things by fits and starts is not right. It is not necessary to go to every meeting; in fact, some meetings are for certain groups of saints and other meetings are for a different group of saints.</p>
<p>In the past even though the churches scheduled many meetings during the week with the expectation that every saint would come to every meeting, only those who were &ldquo;fervent&rdquo; came to every meeting. Others could not meet this expectation. When one brother, who could not attend every meeting, came to a meeting, he was asked, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to the prayer meeting? Why didn&rsquo;t you attend the mid-week meeting?&rdquo; Faced with this kind of questioning, he made up excuses in order to not be condemned for loving the world. This damaged his willingness to come to the meetings that he could attend by causing him to feel as if he was inadequate as a Christian. Many saints in this situation eventually stop coming to the meetings and do indeed become backslidden.</p>
<p>We must make some proper adjustments to our schedule. Saints who have a limited amount of time do not need to go to every meeting. At the same time, we should adjust our concept to realize that it is not abnormal if a saint can attend only one or two meetings a week. Even if a saint can come only once every two weeks or once every month, this is not bad.</p><h2 class="head1">STUDYING TO IMPROVE<br />
IN ORDER TO HAVE REMAINING FRUIT</h2>
<p>Over the last sixty years, it has been our practice for the Lord&rsquo;s table to be a joint meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Now we must study how to conduct the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in order to keep the new ones. The Lord&rsquo;s table meeting is the most important meeting of the church, and it is highly regarded by all believers. Some saints truly feel sorry when they cannot attend the table meeting. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study how we should meet in order to break the bread.</p>
<p>Consider a sister who has not been to a meeting for a long time but still longs for the church. Every time she passes the meeting hall, she feels comforted, but she is hesitant to go in because of time constraints, the condition of her health, or responsibilities related to her children or job. We must empathize with her situation. Breaking bread once a week on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in a joint meeting at the meeting hall is not required by the Bible. In fact, Acts 2:46 shows that the believers in the early days broke bread &ldquo;day by day...from house to house.&rdquo; According to the grammar of this verse, the breaking of bread was not in the temple but rather in the homes. Going to the temple was like going to a big meeting, and gathering in homes was like a small group meeting. A big joint meeting is not possible in homes, because no home can accommodate all the saints. In the early church the believers broke bread in small group gatherings, and they broke bread daily.</p>
<p>In other words, the bread-breaking meeting does not necessarily have to be held jointly at a meeting hall on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It would probably not be easy to change immediately, but we can gradually make a change by meeting every other week at the meeting hall and in the homes. Some saints will gain more supply when the breaking of bread is in the homes and at other times, especially if they are unable to come to a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>This kind of fellowship is a suggestion, not a decision. There is a need for more fellowship and study, but we should not be inflexible, confining ourselves to an old way. Over twenty-eight years ago, there were three thousand people meeting regularly in the church life. We must study why forty thousand people have been baptized over the past twenty-eight years, but only five thousand meet regularly today. This cannot be justified. Even if all forty thousand believers were still with us, our current situation would still be lacking. A twenty percent annual increase from a starting number of three thousand should have produced four hundred ninety thousand believers, but we have baptized only forty thousand, less than one-tenth of the number based on a twenty percent increase. Therefore, we must consider our statistics and study how to improve.</p>
<p>Even though we are branches in the vine and there is the law of life within us, we must cooperate in our living and in our environment; otherwise, it will be very difficult to bear fruit. Without cooperation, the law of life will be hindered. We all know that if a tree is planted in a place where water flows and the sun shines, it will grow. However, if the same tree or plant is moved to a place where there is little water and insufficient sunshine, it will not grow well. Even though the tree has life, it will not grow if the outward environment does not match its needs.</p>
<p>There are some plants that do not grow well in direct sunlight, and they must be planted in cool, shady places. Some Christians are like these special plants; that is, if there is too much sun, they will die easily. We must help these ones by starting their growth in the shade. Other Christians are like plants that easily die from being overwatered. When they get less water and less sunshine, they grow well and bloom beautifully. We must be sensitive to the needs of the brothers and sisters. We have to supply them, or else they will die. But if we supply them too much, they will die as well. Therefore, we must supply them according to a proper measure. If we do not visit them, they will not be enlivened, but if we visit them every day, they will die as well. Some may need to be visited once every two or three months, but each time we should give them a tasty supply. We do not need to force them to come to the meetings, because our constant urgings may damage their desire to follow the Lord. We must give them the liberty to come as the Lord leads and take no offense if they do not come. Eventually, we will see the growth of life in them, and we will be encouraged.</p>
<p>I believe that many of us have had this kind of experience. In the past we were fervent, and we tried to drag people to every meeting. Our dragging was like pulling on a plant to help it grow. Outwardly, it seemed that this was helpful, but actually we inhibited their growth, and they eventually died because of our overzealousness. We must change our concept. We do not have to drag people to meetings or regard them as anything less for not coming to meetings. We must allow these &ldquo;special plants&rdquo; to grow slowly. We should not forget them but visit them from time to time to give them a supply. In this way they will grow.</p>
<p>Taking care of a church is more difficult than taking care of a garden or a factory. The saints are on different levels and in different conditions. The saints come in all varieties. Therefore, we must coordinate with their environment so that the life within them can grow. Once this life grows, they will bear fruit. This is the law of life. Therefore, we do not need to be too stiff or rigid by insisting on a certain way. We must consider how to nourish the saints and meet the need of every situation so that they can grow. Being rigid cuts the saints off. We should always consider their situation and their convenience so that they can grow gradually. Even though the annual rate of increase of the church in Taipei is not sufficient, we cannot have a uniform method for everything.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE UNIVERSAL VINE AS<br />
THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD, AND<br />
THE BELIEVERS AS BRANCHES IN THE VINE BEING<br />
IN AN ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The first law of the increase of the church is that Christ and the church are a universal vine as the organism of the Triune God, and the believers, as the branches of this vine, are in an organic union with the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in the Son and<br />
Being One Spirit with the Lord<br />
to Participate in His Position and Authority</h2>
<p>Since the believers are branches, we abide in the Son and are one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17), thereby participating in His position and authority. This is not a small matter. We participate in the Lord&rsquo;s position and authority in His death, resurrection, and ascension because we are one with Him (Eph. 2:5-6). Therefore, we can go out in His name to disciple the people in the world, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:18-19).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in the Son<br />
to Receive the Father&rsquo;s Nurturing<br />
and to Enjoy the Riches of His Divine Nature</h2>
<p>By abiding in the Son, we receive the Father&rsquo;s nurturing, because the Father is the husbandman, the cultivator of the vine (John 15:1). By abiding in the Son, we are able to receive the Father&rsquo;s nurturing and to enjoy the riches of the Father&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), that is, to enjoy all the riches of God (Col. 2:9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in the Son to Experience<br />
the Spirit of Life as the Realization of the Son and the Life Essence of the Believers</h2>
<p>By abiding in the Son, we experience the Spirit as the realization of the Son in us (John 14:17, 19; 15:26). This Spirit of life also becomes our life essence. Even though we are human, the Spirit becomes our life essence when we abide in the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>The increase and spread of the church is related to the law of fruit-bearing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Miraculous in Nature</h2>
<p>The law of fruit-bearing does not involve miracles; this can be seen from the fact that fruit is not produced by miracles. It is useless to fast in the hope that a vine would bear grapes. Neither should we think that a small group can bear fruit miraculously. Gaining fruit in this way rarely happens; miracles are not a reliable method. There were miracles in Acts, but these miracles were related to outward confirmation, not to the producing of fruit. In order to gain fruit, we must pay attention to the law of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being according to the Law of Life</h2>
<p>Fruit-bearing is not miraculous in nature; rather, it is according to the law of life. In order to experience the law of life, we must fulfill certain requirements.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Abiding in the Lord as Branches<br />
to Absorb His Life Supply</h2>
<p>We need to abide in the Lord and absorb His supply. Just as the branches of a tree are attached to a tree in order to receive its life supply, we must abide in the Lord continually and absorb the riches of His life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Abiding in the Lord to Absorb the Supply<br />
of God the Father and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>We also need to abide in the Lord and absorb the supply of God the Father and the supply of the Holy Spirit. When we fellowship with the Lord, we will definitely have a supply from the Father and the Spirit. The supply of the Father is like soil that provides nutrients, and the supply of the Spirit is like rain that waters and refreshes. Trees receive a supply of nutrients from the soil and a supply of water from the rain.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Abiding in the Lord to Absorb the Supply<br />
of God and the Spirit</h2>
<p>Further, we also need to abide in the Lord and absorb God as our light and the Spirit as our air. When we abide in the Lord, we have these two kinds of supply.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Abiding in the Lord and Living in the Church<br />
for Nurturing and Protection</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to abide in the Lord and live in the church as the garden of God so that we can be nurtured and protected.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Bearing New Fruit Each Month</h2>
<p>When we abide in the Lord, we will surely bear new fruit each month. This is a principle in the Bible (cf. Rev. 22:2).</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>If we all accept the Lord&rsquo;s leading and set up a schedule, our number will triple by the end of the year. This is equal to a two hundred percent rate of increase. I am very hopeful, because the condition of the church has matured, and the social environment in Taiwan is very receptive to the spread of the gospel. The inward condition of the church is good, and the outward social situation is also good. These two factors will help us gain a twofold reaping.</p>
<p>I also hope that the elders will pay attention to the need related to the purchase of land and the building of a meeting hall. A meeting hall is not a requirement, but a large meeting hall can help us gain better results. A large hall is like a university, a medium-sized hall is like a high school, and a small hall is like an elementary school. The church in Taipei has only small and medium-sized halls but not a large hall; therefore, this is a need. Otherwise, even though we continually beget those who can be nurtured in the homes, there will be no &ldquo;university&rdquo; to teach and perfect them. With a large meeting hall, we can gather for many different meetings, either once a week, once a month, once every three months, or even once every five months.</p>
<p>The emphasis of these messages on the increase and spread of the church is not on doctrines or even statistics; rather, the intention is to bring us into the reality of the increase and spread corporately. This is very much related to the Lord&rsquo;s further advance among us. I hope that we all would pray concerning this.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PLANNING FOR THE INCREASE<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 1:3; Rev. 22:2; Eph. 5:15-17</h1>
<p>In John 15:5 the Lord spoke of a law for the increase and propagation of the church, saying, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; He is the vine, and we are His branches. He and we are a great vine in the universe. A fruit tree bears fruit according to a law of life; it does not bear fruit because someone prays for three days or because God performs a miracle that results in the sudden appearance of clusters of fruit. Rather, a fruit tree grows leaves at a set time, sprouts buds at a set time, blossoms at a set time, and finally bears fruit at a set time. This is according to a law of life.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 speaks of our going and discipling all the nations, Mark 16:15 speaks of our going into all the world and proclaiming the gospel to all the creation, and Luke 24:47 speaks of our proclaiming repentance for forgiveness of sins in His name to all the nations. However, John 15:16 speaks of our going forth and bearing fruit. These charges from the Lord show that leading people to salvation through the preaching of the gospel is not merely an outward activity; it is related also to life, showing that the increase and propagation of the church comes out of the operation of the law of life.</p>
<p>The propagation of humanity is continuous and always increasing. This propagation is according to a law, not according to signs and wonders. Even the birth of the Lord Jesus was not accomplished through signs and wonders. He was not conceived of the Holy Spirit one day and born of Mary the next day. If this had happened, it would have been a miracle. Instead, the Lord was conceived in Mary&rsquo;s womb and born nine months later according to the law of human life in God&rsquo;s creation. Even His growth was based on the law of our human life. Even though He is omnipotent, He was not born the day after He was conceived, nor did He grow up the next day and begin to minister the following day. The Bible does not associate such signs and wonders with His human life. Instead, it shows the birth and growth of Jesus according to the law of human life: the Lord was born from His mother&rsquo;s womb after nine months, and He grew gradually. In His growth there were years as a child, years as a teenager, and years as a young adult. He did not begin His work until He was thirty years old. When we understand the significance of the law of life, we will realize that the increase and propagation that we are speaking of involve more than merely being stirred up to gain fifty thousand people in a short period of time. We must follow the law of life in John 15. It is very natural for a fruit tree to bear fruit in its season according to the inner law of life. This is a matter of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE UNIVERSAL VINE AS THE ORGANISM<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD,<br />
AND THE BELIEVERS AS BRANCHES IN THE VINE BEING IN AN ORGANIC UNION<br />
WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>According to John 15, Christ and the church are the universal vine. This vine is the organism of the Triune God. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is this vine. Ephesians 4:4-6 shows that the Spirit, the Lord, and God are all mingled in the Body of Christ, which is the universal vine as the organism of the Triune God. As branches of this vine, the believers have an organic union with the Triune God.</p>
<p>The union that we have with God is an organic union. A table is not organic, because it is made with pieces of lifeless wood that are joined together by tenons, nails, and glue. In contrast, the human body is an organism that is joined together with living limbs and organs. The union of the human body is organic in nature. Even though a dentist can make a set of dentures, every person&rsquo;s first teeth are the issue of the growth of life. Life implies growth, because growth is the spontaneous issue of a living organism.</p>
<p>Our union with the Lord Jesus is a union with the Triune God, because the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God; in Him the Triune God is realized. When we believed into the Lord, we entered into Him and were organically joined to Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The branches that are joined to a tree are not nailed to it; rather, they grow out of the tree. When a branch is grafted into a tree, it grows because the life within the branch is connected to the life within the tree; the growth of a grafted branch is the result of an organic union. Similarly, the union that we have with the Lord is an organic union.</p>
<p>In order to enjoy our organic union with the Lord, we need to abide in the Son. We can abide in the Son, because we are one spirit with Him. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; When we are one spirit with the Lord, we partake of His position and authority. Ephesians 2:5-6 tells us that we were crucified with Christ, raised up together with Him, and even seated together with Him in the heavenlies. Because we are in an organic union with Him, He and we, we and He, are joined as one in both position and authority. The Lord has been given all authority in heaven and on earth so that we could go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:18-19). In our going, His authority is our authority, and His heavenly position is our position. When we go forth to preach the gospel, we need the faith and realization that we are in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus and that we have His authority, because we are organically joined to Him.</p>
<p>When we abide in the Son, we absorb the Father&rsquo;s cultivation of the Son. In John 15:1 the Lord spoke of the Father as the husbandman. <em>Husbandman</em> means &ldquo;cultivator of the soil, land-worker, farmer.&rdquo; When we abide in the Son, we absorb the Son, who was cultivated by God the Father so that He could work Himself with all His riches into the vine, enabling us to partake of all the riches of the Father&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). This is a matter in the spirit. We have to learn to abide in the Lord every day. As we abide in Him, we absorb the riches of God&rsquo;s cultivation by partaking of the divine nature.</p>
<p>When we abide in the Son, we experience the Spirit as the realization of the Son (John 14:17, 19; 15:26). The Lord Jesus is realized as the Spirit so that He can become the reality in us. Today the Lord Jesus is in us as the Spirit, and this Spirit is the realization of the Lord Jesus. When we pray, we have the assurance that He is operating in our spirit. When we lack strength, He operates in our spirit to become our strength. This is the Spirit becoming the realization of the Lord. We do not have holiness, but when we turn to the Lord and pray to Him, the Spirit operates in our spirit to work the Lord with His holy nature into us. Consequently, Christ becomes our holiness through the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of Christ in our life and experience. Hence, when we abide in the Lord, we experience the Spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit is also the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) in those who believe in the Lord. He is the essence of life in us. We have a spiritual essence in us, and this essence is the Triune God. Today the Triune God is our essence, and the indwelling Spirit of life causes the Triune God to be realized in our experience.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>According to John 15, we need to bear fruit. When we bear fruit, the church increases. Fruit-bearing is according to a law; it does not depend on our feelings or on a miraculous response to prayer. Fruit is borne according to a law that is assisted by fertilization, watering, and pruning. If there is too much fertilizer, a fruit tree will die, but if there is not enough fertilizer, the tree will not grow robustly. Similarly, if there is too much water, the tree will be damaged, but if there is not enough water, the tree will dry up and die. Thus, we need to pay particular attention to the environment for cultivation, which also includes factors such as sunlight and air. If all these factors work together properly, a tree will begin to bear fruit that will fully ripen in due time.</p>
<p>Today we are branches of the true vine, the Lord, and we have made a vow before the Lord to lead people to salvation. Nevertheless, we must realize that the way to lead people to salvation is not merely to lead them to believe and be baptized; it also involves infusing them with the riches that we have received and experienced through the Spirit so that the divine life can grow in them. In the past we have neglected the law of fruit-bearing, and we were unfruitful.</p>
<p>The law of fruit-bearing involves abiding in the Lord and being in union with the Triune God. Bearing fruit comes out of the law of life, not out of miracles. The law of life, which is the law of fruit-bearing, involves four points: First, we should abide in the Lord, just as the branches abide in the vine, to absorb the life supply of the Lord. Second, we should abide in the Lord to absorb the supply of God the Father as our source of nutrients and the supply of the Holy Spirit as our source of watering and refreshing. Third, we should abide in the Lord to absorb the supply of God as our light and the Spirit as our air. We must receive a supply from God as our nutrients, water, light, and air so that the life within us can grow and bear fruit according to its law. Finally, we need to abide in the Lord and live in the church as the garden of God so that we can be nurtured and protected. We need to live in the church, just as a vine has to remain in the garden, in order to receive protection and care. If a vine is moved to the roadside, it will be trampled to death by traffic. Leaving the church is like leaving the garden that protects and shelters us from loss and damage. When we remain in God&rsquo;s garden, that is, the church, we are preserved. Under these conditions, we will bear new fruit according to the law of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past you may not have heard that the increase of the church requires planning. However, the Bible shows that God&rsquo;s work, including creation, redemption, the establishment in His new creation, and the building of the New Jerusalem, are all according to a plan. For example, Ephesians 1:4-5 speaks of God&rsquo;s will and of His choosing and predestinating of us according to His will. Our salvation was not an accidental occurrence; we were saved according to God&rsquo;s wise plan, which He carried out with much consideration and prudence (v. 8). People move from place to place, and when they move, they often come in contact with Christians who preach the gospel to them. They may ignore the word of the gospel, but then they may find that their new neighbors are also Christians. Their salvation may seem to be a coincidence, but there are no coincidences with God. We were chosen and predestinated by God for salvation. This indicates that God is a planning God.</p>
<p>The preparation of a plan requires consideration prior to taking action. Planning is essential for businessmen, who must consider such things as the amount of money that is available for expenses and investment, the skill level of the company&rsquo;s manpower, and the amount of other resources that are needed to be profitable. Although these considerations are common in business planning, very few people apply planning to matters related to spirituality, to the church, and to the growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO A PLAN</h2>
<p>God has an eternal plan. Based on His plan, He created the heavens, the earth, and the things in the heavens and on the earth according to a schedule. The increase and spread of the church not only require a plan but also a schedule to carry out the plan. Ephesians 5:15-17 confirms this point, saying, &ldquo;Walk, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&rdquo; In between the matter of being wise and understanding the will of the Lord, Paul speaks of redeeming the time.</p>
<p>Redemption is related to recovering things that are lost, and in God&rsquo;s eyes, people lose time every day. If a person is not saved, does not love the Lord, does not walk in the will of God, and does not bear fruit according to God&rsquo;s will, in God&rsquo;s eyes the time of his life has been wasted. A believer, however, can redeem the time by being &ldquo;filled in spirit&rdquo; (v. 18). When we walk according to the Spirit and fellowship with the Lord, we do not lose time; instead, we redeem it.</p>
<p>In order to bear fruit for the Lord, we must have a schedule so that our time is redeemed, not wasted. Without a schedule for our daily living, much of our day will be wasted. For example, when we wake up at six o&rsquo;clock on Saturday morning, we may feel that it is too early to get up and decide to sleep a little longer. It may be seven o&rsquo;clock when we are stirred from our sleep again, but because our back is sore, we decide that more sleep is needed. When eight o&rsquo;clock arrives, we may decide to rest even more since we do not have to go to work on Saturday. Finally, at nine o&rsquo;clock we decide to get out of bed but only to drink some water, eat some breakfast, and read the newspaper. By the time we are finished with our breakfast activities, it may be close to the time for a noon nap, which will take up even more of our day.</p>
<p>In contrast, the schedule of a student often prevents him from wasting too much time. Since his classes start every morning at eight o&rsquo;clock, he will use an alarm clock in order to not miss the bus that takes him to school. Even if the alarm clock goes off several times before he gets up, he knows that he cannot continually reset the alarm if he expects to get to school on time. A student needs a schedule, because time and buses do not wait for anyone. If a student comes to the bus stop thirty seconds after its scheduled stop, he will miss the bus. In order to graduate, he needs to redeem the time, arriving at school on time and attending his required courses, day after day, week after week, month after month, and semester after semester.</p>
<p>By applying a schedule of work and rest to an educational plan, a student can complete elementary school in six years, junior high in another three years, high school in three more years, and graduate from college in another four years. If a person works and rests according to a schedule, he can graduate from college even if he is not able to make the highest grades. However, without a plan and schedule, it would be difficult for a student with weak academic skills to graduate. It is difficult to accomplish anything without a schedule. A schedule is the best means to redeem the time.</p>
<p>Many people are restricted by a schedule when they are in school, but after they graduate, it seems as if they &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; from the practice of using a schedule. It is good, therefore, that work also follows a schedule. When we go to work in society, we must follow a schedule. If we are late to work every day, we will be dismissed, and if we want a good job evaluation, we have no choice but to follow a schedule. A person who does not follow a schedule will do poorly in school and probably will be unsuccessful in his career as well.</p>
<p>We have all been saved, but we may never have heard a message about the need for a schedule in spiritual matters. When I was young, I heard many messages on redeeming the time, and I was taught by the Brethren to redeem the time. However, they did not touch the practical point about the need for a schedule for the sake of our spiritual life. It is rare to find anyone who makes a schedule related to his spiritual life. Even if we cannot keep the schedule that we make, it is still good to make a schedule.</p>
<p>A schedule is very important to me. Yesterday morning I woke up at half past three and began to meditate over the contents of this conference. Then I rose up at five o&rsquo;clock and wrote outlines for two messages in preparation for today. This morning I woke up at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning and started to consider the work ahead of me. Nevertheless, I restrained myself from rising up too early in order to not overexert myself physically. I rose at six o&rsquo;clock and quickly completed two outlines for today with the help of an assistant, and I changed the two outlines that I wrote yesterday. If I did not have a schedule, I would never have been able to complete the outlines for these meetings.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters in Taipei should make a schedule based on a plan in order to have a new beginning in the church life. Starting from the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we should have a plan for what we need to do every day. We should pray much while making this schedule, because our schedule has to be complete and balanced. Although we must schedule time for morning revival, prayer, and visiting the saints, our schedules will vary based on our individual circumstances.</p>
<p>When considering morning revival, for example, we should not think that we need to set aside an hour and a half in order to be &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; Practically speaking, morning revival should be twenty minutes at the most, including ten minutes for reading the Word and ten minutes for prayer. If this is too difficult, we can begin with five minutes for reading the Word and five minutes for prayer. After six months the time can be increased to seven and a half minutes for reading the Word and prayer, and by the end of the year our morning revival can be twenty minutes. In this way, steady progress can be made.</p>
<p>Some localities have a corporate morning revival that is one hour long. However, very few saints can come to a morning revival that lasts one hour. If the majority of the saints are not able to make this time, it is not wise to schedule such a time. Since most people cannot walk on a tightrope, it is not prudent to ask everyone to walk on a tightrope. Hence, the church should not set up or suggest a schedule that most saints cannot meet. A schedule must be appropriate to one&rsquo;s ability. The church in Taipei has asked the saints to schedule ten minutes in the morning for morning revival; this is reasonable. It is useless to set up a schedule that only a few can keep.</p>
<p>The schedule of the meetings of the church should also be considered. In addition to the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and the prayer meeting, there are other meetings during the week. When we set a schedule, we must set a suitable schedule. We should not be impulsive and go to meetings when we feel good, but stay at home when we feel cold toward the Lord. We should not be so variable, because this will keep us from advancing in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>The number of meetings a believer should attend must be based on practical daily circumstances. For example, a single sister, who has recently graduated from college and who works only forty hours a week, will have more time at her disposal. In addition to the regular meetings of the church, she can go to one or two additional meetings. This is because her circumstances allow her to attend all the meetings of the church. After this sister is married, she will have a husband and a house that require some attention, and soon she will probably also have children. When she has a house, a husband, and several children to care for, she will not be able to maintain the meeting schedule that she had when she was a single sister. If she tries, her family will suffer. For example, who will take care of her children if her husband must work and she is at a meeting? All these factors must be taken into consideration. If her husband is a brother in the Lord, then the sister should fellowship with him about her meeting schedule. At the same time, the church should also consider the needs of the saints. It might have been possible for a sister to attend every meeting when she was not married, but after marriage and children this is not possible. However, she should not stop meeting altogether, because this would be like having no church life. Rather, she should carefully choose the meetings that she can go to based on her circumstances. At the same time, she should remember her vow before the Lord to bear fruit every year. Bearing fruit requires time, and even though she has a husband and children, she should set aside some time during the week to pray for others and to do some gospel work such as writing letters, sending books, or visiting others. She should do these things even if she has to give up one meeting. This is the principle of setting up a schedule.</p><h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In order for the church to increase and spread, there must be a plan. The plan for a church should be based on the condition of the believers&rsquo; spiritual life, the social conditions in the church&rsquo;s locality, and the relationship between the believers and those in various social classes. The church in a locality must set a rate for increase at the beginning of each year. This rate can be ten percent, twenty percent, fifty percent, or even one hundred percent. For the past twenty years we have suffered a loss because we have conducted business without a plan (Luke 19:13). It is as though we have labored aimlessly for more than twenty years. As a result, our time has been wasted, and the Lord&rsquo;s work has been delayed. From now on, a church must make a plan at the beginning of each year.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has made a plan for a one hundred percent rate of increase. Of the five thousand five hundred people currently in the church in Taipei, three thousand five hundred regularly attend the meetings, and one thousand five hundred are willing to make a plan. It will not be difficult for each of these one thousand five hundred to lead one person to salvation each year. But it will not be easy to achieve a one hundred percent increase based on the total number of saints in the church. However, as long as the plan of the church is carried out properly, it will be possible to reach this goal.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has been divided up into three hundred fifty small groups that have already started to meet. The small groups are like an &ldquo;all-inclusive dose&rdquo; that solves every problem and heals every sickness. We have not increased, because we have neglected the practice of the small groups. Many other problems are related to our lack in the practice of the small groups. Now we must focus our attention on the small groups. As we begin to pay attention to the small groups, our sicknesses will be healed. Therefore, we should not be anxious about our plan, because the small groups will have a great impact on our increase and spread. Even now we can see some impact through the recovery of three to four hundred saints in just the past six to seven weeks. We should not relax because of this success; instead, all the co-workers, elders, and saints should be even more diligent to work on the small groups so that the small groups can be established.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR DISTRICT MEETING HALLS</h2>
<p>We need to focus on a few matters concerning our plan for district meeting halls. First, the rate of increase set by the whole church must be accepted by those in the district meeting halls. If the church decides on a one hundred percent increase, no one should throw cold water on the idea and propose a fifty percent increase instead. We must learn to accept the plan set by the church. Second, the plan set by the church must be carried out and accomplished by those in every district meeting hall. The plan must be accepted and carried out with diligent effort. Third, the plans of the saints must be monitored and promoted on a monthly basis in the district meeting halls. A good company reviews its accounting figures monthly in order to see if it is meeting its annual goals. If a plan is not working, a company will make adjustments in order to achieve its goals. Similarly, we should not wait until the end of the year to review our progress. We must pay close attention to this every month in order to promote the plans of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANNING FOR EACH BELIEVER</h2>
<p>The most important plan is the daily plan for each believer. Please accept our suggestions and work out a schedule for a personal plan according to the simple ways listed below.</p>
<p>First, develop a plan based on the number of your family members, friends, neighbors, and other acquaintances. If you know a hundred people, it is not appropriate to plan to lead only one person to salvation. However, it may be difficult to lead four people to salvation if you know only two people. Your plan should be based on the number of people you know. If you know a hundred people, you can plan to lead at least four people to salvation this year.</p>
<p>Second, you should make a list of those whom you plan to lead to salvation. Then you can seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to whom you should labor on first, and you can begin to pray over each name. Making a list is very helpful especially in the matter of prayer. Prayers for others cannot be general; you must name them in prayer one by one. You should be careful not to labor on too many people at the same time. Focus on eight to ten people, praying specifically for them by name.</p>
<p>Third, you should regularly contact the people on your list by phone calls, letters, and invitations. Give them Bibles, spiritual books, and gospel tracts. You should not be zealous for a month but then do nothing in the following months. If you try to do something every day, you will become exhausted. It is better to be regular, doing something once a week or even once every other week.</p>
<p>Fourth, you should allocate your time daily, weekly, and monthly according to the needs of your family and work responsibilities. In any case, an appropriate amount of time should be set aside specifically to contact people to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Fifth, according to the allocation of time, you must faithfully carry out your schedule, week after week, month after month, expecting a harvest every season. Based on our experience, it is best to set aside at least one hour every week in order to contact people to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>You have to labor on these matters over the long term; nothing will be accomplished overnight. You may not see any results in the first few months, but if you continue month after month, you will see results gradually. If we practice this, everyone will be able to lead at least one person to salvation in a year. Only a person who is unwilling will be unable to lead at least one person to salvation in a year.</p>
<p>These are suggestions. May we work on them seriously and not treat them as if they are too difficult. Some people may think that this is difficult, because many saints have not led anyone to salvation, even though the church has been preaching the gospel for over thirty years. However, the past is the past, and beginning this year we can practice according to a schedule. In our daily life and church life we must set aside time specifically for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING FRUIT IN ITS SEASON</h2>
<p>To summarize, you should make a list of names, using a special notebook that contains a detailed record of your friends, neighbors, and acquaintances. Then examine it carefully, and select a few names to focus on this year. Then under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, labor on them, pray for them, regularly call them, write to them, invite them to dinner, and visit them. Continually contact them, giving them spiritual books, Bibles, and gospel tracts. Whenever there is a gospel meeting of the church or any gospel activity in your small group, invite them to attend. If everyone does this for the long term, there will be fruit in its season. This is a law.</p>
<p>If you do these things, you will lead people to salvation time and time again, just as a tree planted beside streams of water will yield its fruit in its season (Psa. 1:3), according to the law of life. When the operation of the law of life is coordinated with the arrangement of the outward environment, including such things as the number and places for various meetings, there will be spiritual progress. These two matters go hand in hand, and we should study them well.</p>
<p>I hope that we will have a new beginning this year. I believe that after six months we will see some practical results, and at the end of the year we will be strengthened by the realization that this way is both workable and under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FORMING SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR MEETINGS BEING LIKE OUR HOME LIFE</h2>
<p>We should not imitate the practice of Christianity in our meetings. For over thirty years we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit and to function in the meetings. The Bible does not speak of someone presiding over or taking the lead in Christian meetings. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has...&rdquo; In this verse the first thing that the saints have is a psalm, which means that when the saints gather together, anyone can call a hymn. Our meetings should be as comfortable as our home life because we have been in meetings together for many years, just like a family. We should not be unfamiliar with the things that we need to do in a meeting, such as exercising our spirit and functioning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Singing Hymns<br />
Not Only Loudly and Clearly<br />
but Also in a Refined Manner</h2>
<p>Many among us are not familiar with how to sing hymns in a meeting. When I heard you sing, &ldquo;Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love; / It is Thy Church so blessed&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #852), I sensed a lack of refinement in the use of this hymn. When we sing hymns, we should not only be loud and clear in our singing but also refined in our enjoyment. For example, after singing each stanza, there could be a short prayer of longing and enjoyment: &ldquo;O Lord! I love Your dwelling place. I love Your church; she is Your joy and heart&rsquo;s delight, and she is also where my heart finds rest.&rdquo; Or we could pray, &ldquo;O Lord! The church is so lovely. As we come here, our hearts are joyful; once we are here, our hearts find rest.&rdquo; After such a simple prayer, our feeling will be quite different when we sing the next stanza. Every stanza should be the pouring out of our feelings from within, expressing our appreciation to the Lord. In this matter, we need to practice until we are more skillful.</p>
<p>In the Christian college where I studied, there was a one hour worship service Monday through Saturday at 11:30 A.M. During this time, sermons were given in English by Western pastors. Some of the pastors would speak regardless of whether the students understood or not. Since we could not leave early, we suffered through this time, looking at our watches and waiting for the meeting to be dismissed. This is the situation in Christianity, but our meetings should not be like this. When we worship the Lord, our spirit is refreshed. We not only should worship and enjoy the Lord; we should also testify to Him of our enjoyment. This speaks of the importance of singing hymns.</p>
<p>When we meet, we should be like players on a basketball court. In particular, when singing hymns, one person should not shout the words repeatedly and continuously. This would be like one person dribbling the ball all the time. We have been meeting for many years, and we have many meetings every year. Hence, we have many opportunities for everyone to practice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Exercise the Spirit<br />
in the Meeting</h2>
<p>At the end of 1962, I received a burden from the Lord to start the work in the United States, and I began the work by stressing the exercise of the spirit. The American saints surely know how to exercise their spirit. In the meetings one hundred fifty saints can be &ldquo;playing basketball,&rdquo; not just five. In the meetings they &ldquo;pass the ball&rdquo; from one person to another. Moreover, their meetings have reached a point where there is no formal calling of hymns, no preaching, and even no announcement to start the meeting; the meetings just begin spontaneously. The first person who comes to the meeting begins to pray, and when another comes, he begins to pray as well. There are no long prayers; instead, everyone follows each other with prayers that are two or three sentences in length but which are full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have not yet entered into this kind of exercise in the Far East. It seems as if we are still in our old culture. May the Lord forgive us. I hope that 1985 would be a new beginning. We need more practice. For example, we should practice singing hymns with two or three saints, and pray after each stanza. We also should be willing to critique one another so that there would be greater benefit.</p>
<p>God can accomplish whatever He desires to accomplish; He does not need to practice, because He does not need to learn. But since we are not God, we need to learn and practice. Even though I am eighty years old this year, I still need to learn. I have many dictionaries in many languages, and I use them whenever I write because I still need to learn. We need to learn in order to glorify the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">FORMING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>The first realm of our life is our family; the second realm is our meetings. When we meet, we should not follow Christianity by keeping religious rituals. In Christianity the pastors give sermons, designated persons offer prayers, and the believers do nothing. This is not the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Every one of us should be able to read the Word, pray, call hymns, and sing hymns. Moreover, everyone should be a prophet and an apostle. Everyone should function in the meetings.</p>
<p>However, many of us have been meeting regularly for many years, but we are like a basketball team that is not well coordinated. A family also requires coordination. Even though everyone is willing to eat, some in the family must be willing to cook and wash dishes. When meals are properly prepared and dishes are properly washed, a family will be healthy. Our problem is that our meals are not well prepared and our dishes are not washed properly. Therefore, we must study our way of meeting, especially our small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Small Groups Being<br />
a Gathering of Neighborhood Believers,<br />
Not a Unit of Formal Organization</h2>
<p>A small group is a gathering of a small number of neighboring believers. This is not a unit of organization; it is only a gathering of eight or ten brothers and sisters who live close to one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Attending Any Small Group<br />
for the Sake of Convenience,<br />
according to the Lord&rsquo;s Leading</h2>
<p>For the sake of convenience, a brother or sister can attend any small group according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Even though I have previously said that our small groups should be formed according to geography, it is permissible to go to another neighboring small group. There are no ironclad rules in this regard. Some may think that this will result in disorderliness, but this kind of &ldquo;disorderliness&rdquo; needs to be analyzed from the standpoint of whether or not the saints are living. It is not necessarily good to be so &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; but so dead. We should enliven the saints, not kill them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding and Rejecting Natural Preferences<br />
and Fleshly Choices</h2>
<p>Even though a saint can follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading and gather with another small group for the sake of convenience, he should absolutely avoid and reject natural preferences and fleshly choices. Even though a saint can choose, his choice must be according to the leading of the Spirit. The leading brothers should not create ordinances but rather lead the saints to know the flesh and the natural man. Christianity regulates people so that they will not be disorderly, but the church must emphasize spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being a Religious Organization</h2>
<p>A small group is not a religious organization; consequently, there are no leading ones in a small group. All the saints have equal obligations, equal responsibilities, and an equal opportunity to minister to others. I hope that we would pay attention to this point and fully emphasize it. When eight or ten saints gather together, everyone is a leading one with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Emphasizing Religious Rituals</h2>
<p>In the small groups we should sing hymns and pray according to inspiration and feeling, and we should read and speak the Word according to burden and need. In the small groups there are no religious rituals or set practices such as first singing a hymn and then praying. Our hymn singing and praying should not be based on rituals but on our inspiration and feeling, and our reading and speaking of the Word should come out of a burden from the Lord and the needs of the brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Providing for Spiritual Fellowship</h2>
<p>The gathering of the small group is for spiritual fellowship. In this fellowship there should be an emphasis on shepherding and teaching one another. There should be a mutual shepherding of one another. Someone asked me whether it was possible for sisters to shepherd brothers. During the time in a small group gathering, the sisters should forget that they are sisters and remember that they are members. However, at other times, when the gathering is concluded, it is good for the sisters to remember that they are sisters and not be so bold. Boldness in a small group is welcome, but boldness in other situations can result in trouble. The protection of a woman is to be hidden and to not assume the headship. But in a small group gathering, the sisters do not need to be hidden. Everyone can speak one to another in earnestness. However, there is still a need for order.</p>
<p>The group gathering is a home meeting. In the home young and old alike can speak. When we come into a small group, we should be free to share our feelings and our needs with others. We should also minister what we have received from the Lord to others. This is to show care and concern for one other.</p>
<p>In big meetings it is difficult for us to have fellowship with one another. However, when seven or eight brothers and sisters gather as a small group, there is time for fellowship about many matters. We can fellowship concerning our problems and burdens, having an intimate care for one another. Since we are members one of another, we should share our joy as well as our sufferings. This can be put into practice only in the small groups.</p>
<p>Before taking the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I attended Sunday services in a big chapel. After the service no one ever came to greet me, and I also did not seek out others. I knew many people by their last name, and many knew my name, but we never conversed with one another. This is not a normal condition. In the church the brothers and sisters must know one another, bear difficulties together, and share in joy together. Hence, there is a need for the small groups. If we gather in groups for six months, we will feel the sweetness of the small group and enjoy an intimate supply from one another. This will edify all the saints.</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Worldliness</h2>
<p>In a small group we particularly need to avoid pleasures and celebrations. <em>Pleasures</em> is not a good word. James 4:3 says, &ldquo;You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.&rdquo; When the saints come to the small group gathering in our home, it is normal for our heart to be full of joy. In order to express our love, it is easy to serve delicacies and to eat lavishly, but this can easily offend the Lord. If food is served, it should be simple, even simpler than what we normally eat at home. The emphasis of a love feast should be on fellowship, not on eating and drinking. Furthermore, the food should be prepared in a simple, clean, refreshing, and hygienic manner so that people do not become sick.</p>
<p>We must do our best to avoid worldliness, including celebrations, in the small groups. After meeting with a small group for a long time, we will know everyone quite well, and it will be easy to consider the celebration of birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries, including the giving of gifts. Our love for one another, however, is not manifested through celebrations and the giving of gifts. Our love is in the spirit, in reality. If we see one of our brothers and sisters in need, however, it would be good if we could help provide for their needs as a group through fellowship. This would please the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding Socializing</h2>
<p>We should not engage in vain talk or have personal affection toward some in our small group gathering. When people gather together and meet for the first time, they cannot help but converse with one another. However, it is easy for our preferences and emotions to direct our conversation. Although this is difficult to avoid, we should exercise to treat everyone equally. We must love not only those who are meek and considerate but also those who have a bad temper. God sends rain on the just and the unjust, and He even loves His enemy (Matt. 5:45-48). Therefore, we must avoid personal affection. Although I have coordinated with some brothers for decades, and we honestly love each other, we do not have personal affection for one another. It is easy for personal consideration to lead to mistakes.</p>
<p>Since those in a small group have much contact with one another, it is inevitable that the saints will become close. If we do not exercise to avoid worldliness and socializing, we will eventually begin to gossip about others and create many problems when we come to each other&rsquo;s homes. In order to prevent this from happening, we should not allow worldliness and socializing to creep into the gatherings. Our fellowship, love, and care for one another should be in Christ and in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Small Part of a Local Church,<br />
Not an Independent Entity</h2>
<p>The small group is not the church; it is only a small part of the church in a locality. It is not an independent entity. A small group is under the leading of the elders in the church. No matter how many small groups there are in a locality, all are under the leading of the elders because only this keeps the oneness of the Body of Christ in that locality. Any other consideration will produce divisions.</p>
<p>We should never have the thought of producing or building up something that is independent. Once something independent is produced, it will become a sect. We need to learn to be fully open to every small group in a church. Every small group must be open to every other small group, welcoming and embracing the brothers and sisters in the other groups. No one should be treated as an outsider, and no one should be excluded. Furthermore, we do not need to compare our group to other groups or to compete with other groups. We have to avoid this corrupt practice.</p>
<p>If someone is weak and tells you that he does not like his particular small group because a brother in his group is harsh, you should not try to solve his problem by suggesting that he come to your gathering because the brothers in your group are not harsh. You should not do such a thing. Even if the brothers in his small group are like tigers, you should help him go back to his small group. In a small group gathering, we should not try to draw people to us or give the impression that we are competing with others; this is the proper, normal condition of a small group gathering.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTION OF THE SMALL GROUP</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW MATTERS REGARDING<br />
THE FORMATION OF SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>Concerning the formation of small groups, a few points need to be explained clearly. First, a small group is the gathering of a small number of neighboring believers; it is not a unit of organization. Hence, instead of designating the coming together of a small group as a meeting, it would be more appropriate and accurate to call it a gathering. There is a slight difference between a meeting and a gathering. When a few saints gather for fellowship, it should not be considered as a meeting.</p>
<p>A small group is a gathering, not an organized entity. In the church life, organization kills the saints, but the absence of organization enlivens the saints. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, a brother or sister must be able to attend any small group according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. It is very important for us to see that the small groups are not organized units. If we consider a small group as an organized unit, the saints will be restricted in their ability to gather with a group according to their schedule and responsibilities. Small groups are not units of organization; they should be formed for the convenience of the saints. Hence, the saints should not be limited to one group. Nevertheless, the convenience of a saint does not mean that natural preferences and fleshly choices are acceptable. Natural preferences and fleshly choices must be avoided.</p>
<p>If we do not attend a small group because there is a brother or sister whom we dislike in the group, this is the flesh. The works of the flesh will result in corruption. We should not do anything according to the flesh. Furthermore, if we choose to join a group that has a &ldquo;spiritual giant,&rdquo; rather than a group composed of seemingly &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; saints, we will gain very little. God is not mocked. We should trust in God instead of putting too much trust in the condition of a small group. Often God&rsquo;s blessing can be restricted if the saints in a group are too strong. God is the God of orphans and widows. We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, looking to Him as if we were infants. Those who think they are capable are denied His blessings, but whenever we sincerely say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not know what to do; I truly am nothing,&rdquo; the blessing comes. We must trust in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>In following the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we should not feel as if we are restricted to fellowshipping with only one group. After a period of time, the Lord may lead us to fellowship with a different group. There are no rigid rules in this regard. However, we should not make a change based on natural likes and dislikes, much less based on the flesh. Choices based on preferences and the flesh violate a spiritual law, and once a spiritual law is violated, there can be no blessing.</p>
<p>Second, the small groups are not religious organizations; therefore, no responsible ones should be assigned to take the lead. The practice of having no one assigned to take the lead is to not take the way of organization. Every organization depends upon a leading one, a responsible one, but based on our experience, a leading one often replaces the saints and kills their organic function. This is not profitable. When the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, He did not designate a leader. When the names of the apostles are listed in the Bible, Peter is usually mentioned first (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13). In Galatians 2:9, however, James is mentioned first. Therefore, we cannot say that Peter was always the leader. Hence, in our small group gatherings, no one has been given the responsibility to take the lead. Under normal circumstances, the grace that one has at the time of the gathering is the source of the group&rsquo;s leading. According to grace and fact, there will always be a leader, but this leading will not be based on a position or title. Everyone should be a leader in a small group because everyone has the same obligation and same opportunity to supply others.</p>
<p>Third, a small group should not pay attention to religious rituals. Today in the Sunday worship &ldquo;services&rdquo; in Christianity, hymns are sung, prayers are offered, the Word is read, and sermons are preached according to set procedures; these procedures are religious rituals. Even though these practices are not sinful, they kill the spirit within the believers and virtually annul their organic function. Overcoming this deadening condition is a focus of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover the exercise of the spirit and the organic functioning of the saints. Therefore, when we come together, we should not be concerned with religious rituals; as long as someone has a burden to pray or sing, he should function accordingly.</p>
<p>I began meeting in Christianity when I was a child. For over seventy years, I have seen many different situations. A considerable number of believers wait for a meeting to begin, but the Bible does not tell us when a meeting should begin. Although we have set a time to gather together, there is nothing wrong with coming early and beginning to pray. This is to have the fact of a beginning but not the formality of one. A small group recently testified that they met from 8:30 P.M. to after 11 P.M., with different saints coming at different times. This is a real break from religion and a genuine group gathering. We need to be flexible in the time of our group gatherings; otherwise, some saints may be shut outside the door.</p>
<p>We need to cast off the old ways that we have been following for decades, and the best way to cast them off is to gather in small groups. In practicing to gather in small groups, we should focus on exercising to touch spiritual reality. If we exercise in this way, there will surely be a blessing.</p>
<p>Fourth, the small groups are for fellowship in order to shepherd, teach, and mutually care for one another. When I go to different places to meet, the saints all think that I do not need any shepherding. Little do they realize that I also need to be shepherded. Whenever I go to a place, I truly look forward to the mutual shepherding. We all need mutual shepherding. None of us should be so proud as to think that we do not need any shepherding or teaching. Lambs are not the only ones in need of shepherding; even old sheep need to be shepherded. In fact, the older a person is, the more he needs to be cared for and shepherded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to have a mutual concern and care for one another. Christians are members one of another. When one member suffers, all the members suffer. We need to have a concern and care for one another. This cannot be accomplished in large meetings. Even if only one hundred people gathered together, it would be hard to show much concern and care for others. However, the concern and care that a member needs is easy to find in a group of ten or less saints. When a small number of saints gather together, it is easy to understand the conditions and situations of the other saints, which brings in true concern and care. This gives the Holy Spirit a great opportunity to grant us grace.</p>
<p>Fifth, we need to avoid worldliness in the small groups, especially in matters of eating, drinking, and pleasures. In a gathering of a certain group, everyone sat around the table eating from a hot pot. They chatted as they ate, and a newly saved sister was stumbled and no longer wanted to gather with the small group. This is eating, drinking, and having pleasures. <em>Pleasures</em> in the Bible is not a good word. James 4:3 says, &ldquo;You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.&rdquo; If a small group occasionally has a love feast, it should be simple. A small group also should avoid celebrations. In a small group, those who gather together will become quite familiar with one another after a short period of time, and in their effort to render care to one another, some may think that occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries should be celebrated. However, we need to avoid mixing these occasions with the gathering of a small group. A small group gathering is not an occasion for celebrations. We are members of Christ; hence, our coming together is for the purpose of fellowshipping with one another. We should avoid worldly things.</p>
<p>Sixth, we need to avoid socializing. There is no place for vain talk or personal friendships in a small group, and even our fellowship should not be based on personal attachments. There should only be fellowship and love in the Lord.</p>
<p>Seventh, a small group is not an independent entity; it is only a small part of a local church. According to experience, some people like to be first, and they form small parties. In his third Epistle, John spoke of Diotrephes, who loved to be first among them (v. 9). Using a small group to form a small party or a faction is not acceptable; there is only one Body. A small group is not an independent entity, a &ldquo;body&rdquo;; it is only a small part in a local church. It can never become an independent entity. A small group must be according to the following principles. The saints in a small group are under the leadership of the elders in a local church. This is the only leadership. Even if there are eight hundred small groups, they are all still under the leadership of the elders. Furthermore, every small group must be open to the other groups in a local church, welcoming and accepting brothers and sisters from any other small group. In addition, the saints in a small group should not exclude other brothers and sisters or compete with other small groups.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE SMALL GROUP</h2>
<p>In order for a country to be strong, there is the need for strong family units because only strong families can produce strong young people. In addition to the nurturing in the family, there is a need for education. There is a need for nurturing and teaching. According to the revelation in the Bible, the gatherings of the church reflect these two aspects. In Acts those who were saved gathered in the temple (5:42); this was in the principle of a big meeting for teaching. However, they also broke bread, prayed, preached the gospel, and taught from house to house (2:46); this was in the principle of a small group gathering for nurturing. Christian meetings involve two aspects: nurturing and teaching.</p>
<p>Christianity has been on the earth for over nineteen hundred years, and its way of meeting has changed over time. Currently, its way is centered on a big gathering in a chapel with a pastor preaching a sermon. A large gathering, in principle, is not wrong, but it addresses only one aspect. We must not neglect the other aspect&mdash;gathering in the homes. I was born in Christianity when I was young, but I never knew that Christians could gather in small groups.</p>
<p>In 1949 we began the work in Taiwan. At that time, approximately one hundred saints began to meet; at the end of the year approximately nine hundred saints were meeting. After six years there were close to fifty thousand on the whole island. Because of the rapid increase in the number of saints, we felt that there was a need for small groups. This was the first time that we gathered in groups, and we did not have much experience. The development of this practice was eventually interrupted by turmoil. As the small groups were gradually neglected, we began to depend on big meetings. This caused us to suffer loss. This shows that we need small groups in the homes in addition to joint meetings in a hall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Difference in Function between<br />
Joint Meetings and Small Group Gatherings</h2>
<p>Joint meetings and small group gatherings are completely different in function. The nature of a joint meeting is related to teaching, whereas the nature of a small group gathering is related to nurturing. As soon as a child is born, he is fed at home by his mother so that he can grow. In addition to feeding, he also receives other forms of nurturing from his parents at home. A small group, like a home, provides a nurturing environment for the saints. We need to recover this aspect of the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Nurturing Function<br />
of the Small Group Gatherings</h2>
<p>The nurturing function of the small group gatherings involves four matters. First, a small group should build up and support new believers. Without a small group, there will be little support for those who are saved and baptized. By analogy, a newborn child needs a place where he can be nourished, cherished, and supported in order to survive. We must recover and strengthen the small groups so that they can build up and support those who are newly saved as well as those who are already in the church.</p>
<p>Second, a small group should shepherd the young believers and take care of the weak saints. A strong church, like a strong family, will still have ones who are young, sick, or weak. If there are only big meetings and no small group gatherings, it will be difficult to care for the saints who are young, sick, or weak. When a small group is formed with ten or twelve saints, it is quite easy to see who is young, sick, or weak, and the saints will immediately begin to care for them. If every small group would shepherd and care for two or three saints in this way, four hundred groups would be able to easily bring in approximately one thousand people. We need to pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Third, a small group should help recover brothers and sisters who have not met for a long time or who have been lost. This requires much effort because a great number of the saints have disappeared. Recently, the brothers who are studying the information cards found at least two hundred cards with the names of people who could not be located. We should duplicate and distribute these cards to all the districts so that the brothers and sisters can make enquiries. These &ldquo;missing&rdquo; ones are our spiritual children, our brothers and sisters; it is worth our effort to locate them. Many were lost in the past because this was not part of our work. We believe that many of them are still in Taiwan; only a few have gone abroad. We must learn about their situation and then contact and recover them.</p>
<p>We have heard many testimonies that the dormant saints, who have been recovered by the small groups, are very seeking. This shows that they only lacked support and nourishment in the past. Therefore, we should exercise to contact the dormant saints and recover those with whom we have lost contact. Their hearts really desire the church life. One sister was afraid to go into the meeting hall because she had not been meeting for a long time, but after she was contacted by the saints in a small group she became quite living and was attached to the church again. This is a great function of the small group gathering.</p>
<p>Fourth, a small group should preach the gospel to the relatives, friends, and neighbors of the saints who are gathered together.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way to Have the Small Group Gatherings</h2>
<p>The way to have the small group gatherings involves six items.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Remaining Steadfastly<br />
in the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<p>First, a small group needs to keep the teaching of the apostles. Today a majority of Christians do not know the content of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and even fewer know of the apostles&rsquo; fellowship. Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; Although the wording of this verse is plain and easy to understand, it is difficult to translate. We need light from God in order to see the emphasis in these words. Verse 42 speaks of four things: the teaching, the fellowship, the breaking of bread, and the prayers. When Luke wrote this verse, he was precise in his grammatical pairing of these words. In this verse the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles are joined as one group by the conjunction <em>and,</em> and the breaking of bread and the prayers are joined as another group also by the conjunction <em>and.</em></p>
<p>According to common rules of grammar, when objects are listed in sequence, a conjunction can be added after each object. For example, the four items can be listed as &ldquo;the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; Alternatively, a conjunction can be used in front of the last object. For example, the four items can be listed as &ldquo;the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the fellowship, the breaking of bread, and the prayers.&rdquo; However, Luke wrote in a different way in Acts, separating the four items into two groups using the conjunction <em>and</em> twice. This is because the teaching and the fellowship are related to the apostles, but the breaking of bread and the prayers are related to all the saints, not only the apostles.</p>
<p>In the history of Christianity the first group who saw this light was the Brethren in the nineteenth century. Before the Brethren, no one, not even the church fathers, could explain the significance of the wording in Acts 2:42. The Brethren saw that the teaching and the fellowship are of the apostles; that is, there is only one teaching, the unique teaching, and there is only one fellowship, the unique fellowship, both of which are brought in by the apostles. In 1934 Brother Nee spoke concerning these four matters. He said that the teaching and the fellowship are of the apostles, whereas the breaking of bread and the prayers are not. This was new light to me.</p>
<p>Today all the divisions in Christianity are due to different teachings. The Presbyterian denomination has Presbyterian teachings, the Baptist denomination has Baptist teachings, the Catholic Church has Catholic teachings, and other denominations have their respective teachings. Once a different teaching comes in, Christians are divided. Therefore, in 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain dissenting ones not to teach different things. Teaching different things means to teach things that are different from what the apostles taught.</p>
<p>The Old Testament speaks of the law and the prophets. When the Lord Jesus came, He spoke concerning Christ and eventually concerning the church. He appointed twelve apostles, who then preached what the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit revealed to them&mdash;Christ and the church. Christ and the church are God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The word <em>economy</em> is relatively difficult to understand. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s intention, plan, and arrangement. In Christ God was manifested in the flesh, passed through human living, crucifixion, death, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Now He can dispense Himself into those who believe in Him so that they may become the members of Christ. Corporately speaking, they become the church, the Body of Christ. Christ is the mystery of God, whereas the church is the mystery of Christ. Together these two mysteries are a great mystery. This great mystery&mdash;Christ and the church&mdash;is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament speak of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; the teaching of the apostles also speaks of God&rsquo;s economy. In the apostles&rsquo; time, however, some Jewish Christians would not drop the law in the Old Testament; they were concerned with genealogies and their forefathers. Their speaking led many New Testament saints away from Christ and the church to Moses, David, and the law. In their speaking, they were teaching different things.</p>
<p>Some of us were in Christianity for many years and never heard the pure word concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Instead, Christian preachers focused on doctrines related to foot-washing and baptism. Disputes concerning the method and place of baptism have been the source of many divisions among Christians. To insist on a particular form of baptism is to speak different things. Today even the Pentecostal movement teaches different things by focusing on the matter of speaking in tongues. It is rare, however, to hear them speak concerning Christ, much less the church. This is to teach different things.</p>
<p>The speaking of the apostles was centered on Christ and the church&mdash;Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. These two mysteries constitute the great mystery, which is referred to in 1 Timothy 3:16: &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: / He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; <em>Flesh</em> in this verse refers not only to Christ but also to the church. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, particularly when gathering as a small group, we must speak concerning the economy of God&mdash;Christ and the church.</p>
<p>In the apostolic age, teachings related to Greek philosophy, the so-called teaching of the Gnostics, entered into the church in addition to Judaistic things. Paul wrote Colossians to tell the saints that Christ is everything and that they did not need Greek philosophy, just as they did not need the Jewish law. Today Christianity is full of confusion, and there are many methods of biblical interpretation, some of which are not trustworthy. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need to return to the Bible and speak only the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The small group gatherings must hold on to this matter. We should not think that we can speak whatever we like in a small group.</p>
<p>We have to pay attention to this point, because once a small group is formed, there will be a wide-open door. Four hundred small groups will equal four hundred doors. If we are not clear concerning the truth, these open doors will result in disaster. In just a few years many different teachings could be brought into the church. Therefore, the first crucial matter in the way to have a small group is to keep the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>If we speak concerning such things as head covering, baptism, or speaking in tongues, there will be endless disputes. Those who are in a small group must not open a door for disputes. We desire only the teaching of the apostles, which is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ. In the churches of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should not emphasize unimportant matters; we should stress only God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is the teaching of the apostles.</p><h2 class="head3">Remaining Steadfastly<br />
in the Fellowship of the Apostles</h2>
<p>Second, a small group must hold fast to the fellowship of the apostles. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The fellowship of the apostles is their fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. The New Testament believers also have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. This fellowship was brought in by the apostles; hence, this fellowship is a fellowship of the Body of Christ. Like the teaching of the apostles, the fellowship of the apostles is uniquely one in the universe. We cannot have another fellowship outside the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Even though there are many benefits in forming a small group, there is also the potential problem of opening a door. If we are not cautious, many different teachings can come in once a door is open. A different teaching will produce a clique. For example, if some teach concerning speaking in tongues, some will receive it, and a clique will be formed by those who teach and those who receive. We cannot have a small circle of fellowship inside the universal fellowship; neither can we have a small fellowship outside the fellowship of the apostles. In other words, we cannot have a fellowship that is apart from the fellowship of the church. A small fellowship is always the basis of a sect.</p>
<p>Before the nineteenth century no one saw this light, but when the Brethren were raised up in England, they saw the light and released it. From that time onward, the words in Acts 2:42 have been clear. The three thousand who were saved all remained steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles; they did not depart from the teaching and the fellowship. The teaching and the fellowship of the apostles are still with the church today. A person with a dissenting idea, who leads others astray and forms them into a small circle of fellowship, is not remaining steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. They have left the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Breaking of Bread and the Prayers</h2>
<p>Third, a small group needs the breaking of bread. The breaking of bread is for the remembrance of the Lord. At the Lord&rsquo;s table, on the one hand, we enjoy the Lord, and on the other hand, we offer up our adoration to Him. We love Him and honor Him. The Chinese speak of &ldquo;reverence and love,&rdquo; but reverence before love is religious, whereas loving and honoring are experiential. When we are saturated with God&rsquo;s love, there is a response in us of love toward Him, and then out of this love, honor and respect come forth. Fourth, a small group should pray, petitioning the Lord related to the needs of the saints and the church and for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Preaching the Gospel and Teaching the Truth</h2>
<p>Fifth, a small group must preach the gospel. We should preach the gospel beginning with our family, then to our friends and neighbors, and then to all those whom we know.</p>
<p>Sixth, a small group must teach the truth. Paul lived in Ephesus for three years, and he not only taught the saints publicly but also from house to house. The phrase <em>from house to house</em> is mentioned in Acts 2:46; 5:42; and 20:20. This term in Greek means &ldquo;from one house to another house.&rdquo; Paul taught publicly and from house to house; his gatherings from house to house were small group gatherings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when we study the Bible, we can see that the way to have a small group involves six items: speaking according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching, living in the unique fellowship of the apostles, breaking bread to enjoy the Lord with both love and honor, praying to meet the needs of the saints and the church and for His will to be done, preaching the gospel, and learning the truth and teaching the truth for the edification of others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MEMBERS<br />
OF A SMALL GROUP</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE IN A LIVING WAY<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In the church life we need to read the Bible in a living way; this requires practice. For example, the subject of this chapter is &ldquo;The Functioning of the Members of a Small Group.&rdquo; The main points related to the subject of this chapter are taken from Romans 12. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;We who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; Verse 8 says, &ldquo;He who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.&rdquo; And verse 15 says, &ldquo;Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.&rdquo; It is worthwhile to read these verses, but we also need to read them in a living way.</p>
<p>Consider Song of Songs 1:8, which says, &ldquo;If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds&rsquo; tents.&rdquo; The focus of this verse is not on the one who is the fairest among women; rather, it is on pasturing the young goats by the shepherds&rsquo; tents. Christ is the Shepherd, and the churches are the shepherds&rsquo; tents. In a small group some members must bear responsibility to bring the young and weak goats to the gatherings.</p>
<p>Likewise, in reading 2 Timothy 2:2, we should pay attention to the fact that the main point is not on &ldquo;the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses&rdquo; but rather on committing these things to &ldquo;faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; The members of a small group must be faithful men who are competent to teach others. After learning the truth and bringing the young goats to a gathering, there is a need to nourish and teach them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should learn to exercise the spirit when we gather; we do not need to wait for certain brothers to arrive before starting the meeting. In many so-called churches the Sunday service begins only after the pastor arrives and shakes the hand of everyone who is in attendance; this is not proper. Our gatherings do not belong to certain leading brothers but to everyone. If this were the case, we would not be able to meet without a so-called leading one being present. Our gatherings also do not depend on religious rituals, such as singing and praying at the beginning of the meeting. If this were the case, we would not be able to meet without first singing and praying. One time in a meeting I said, &ldquo;Today we will not sing hymns.&rdquo; The saints responded by immediately beginning to pray. Then I said, &ldquo;Today we will also not pray.&rdquo; At once they wanted to read the Bible. Then I said, &ldquo;Let us start the meeting without any singing, praying, reading of the Word, testifying, or sharing.&rdquo; This perplexed the saints, and they did not know what to do. However, this is not a difficult situation for someone with experience in &ldquo;playing ball&rdquo; in a coordinated way.</p>
<p>For instance, two brothers could speak on God&rsquo;s creation of man in Genesis 1 in the form of questions and answers. Brother A could say, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s creation of man was wonderful,&rdquo; and Brother B could ask, &ldquo;In what way was it wonderful?&rdquo; Brother A could reply, &ldquo;When God created all things, He spoke, and they came into existence, but before the creation of man, the Triune God held a conference.&rdquo; Brother B could then ask, &ldquo;What do you mean by a conference?&rdquo; Brother A could answer, &ldquo;There was a consideration, a conference, within the Godhead concerning the creation of man. In this conference the Triune God said, &lsquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness&rsquo;&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26). Brother B could pursue further, asking, &ldquo;What is the image of God?&rdquo; If a meeting was conducted in this way, no one would fall asleep, and Genesis 1:26 would be in our hearts forever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a brother could be asked to memorize and recite Genesis 1:1: &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; Another person could be asked to memorize and recite verse 26: &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; Then a third person could be asked to memorize and recite the first part of verse 31: &ldquo;God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good.&rdquo; At this point, we could ask others to speak on the main thought covered in verses 1, 26, and 31, which is God&rsquo;s creation and the center of God&rsquo;s creation being man.</p>
<p>This illustration shows how we frequently follow old, traditional, natural, and religious concepts rather than exercising our spirit. The culture of the world is constantly progressing. However, in the last two thousand years Christianity has fallen backward rather than advancing. The New Testament contains nothing old, traditional, natural, or religious; it is altogether a revelation of God&rsquo;s economy, which is exceedingly fresh. The apostles brought this revelation to a peak, but the condition of the church began to gradually decline because the saints did not hold to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Later, many old, traditional, natural, and religious concepts were applied to the New Testament. Consequently, over the years, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was completely lost to those in Christianity.</p>
<p>People who attend services in Christianity hear nothing of the high revelation in the New Testament. Although the Bible is in print and in their hands, Christians see nothing of God&rsquo;s revelation when they read the Bible. Instead, they read with their mind and interpret the Scriptures based on their own concepts. Even though our way of reading the Bible is absolutely different from those in Christianity, we still have elements of oldness in our meetings.</p>
<p>Our meetings should reflect the corporate move of the Spirit. We should follow the Spirit, and we should exercise our spirit to be fresh and living. Anyone who has played basketball knows that the ball can be passed to him at any moment. Hence, every person on the team needs to be prepared to receive the ball. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we need to learn to exercise our spirit to worship God, who is Spirit. When we read the Bible with our spirit, our reading is our worship to God. In many heathen religions, people are required to worship by kneeling down and prostrating themselves before idols. Our worship, however, is in spirit. If we read the Bible according to the inspiration of the Spirit in a meeting, the supply that others receive will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>When we meet together, our reading of the Bible should be living. After reading a verse in a living way, a simple prayer can be offered, a hymn can be called, and even a testimony can be given. This kind of exercise will cause everyone to be living. Without the exercise of the spirit, anything we do will be inappropriate and only bring in confusion. We need to exercise our spirit in the meetings because we should not regulate or attempt to direct the corporate move of the Spirit in the meeting. After singing or reading the Bible, some may be inspired to give testimonies, and others may follow with another hymn. In this way there will be a fresh supply in the meeting and no long pauses.</p>
<p>Under the influence of both Christianity and our natural man, it is very easy to fall into rituals rather than to exercise our spirit. Without such an exercise, outward forms may change, but the old content will remain. Hence, we should exercise to be in spirit, because there are no rituals in our spirit; there are only the riches of Christ with all of His freshness. With the exercise of the spirit, every meeting will be living, and the church will be fully revived.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT DESIGNATING LEADING ONES<br />
IN A SMALL GROUP SO THAT EVERYONE<br />
HAS A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p>According to our observation of the present condition of the small groups, if there are twelve people in a group, two or three of them may be strong and exercised. The other brothers and sisters may have little or no understanding of the teaching and fellowship of the apostles or even of the significance of the small groups. While those who are stronger should bear responsibility, there is no need to assign anyone to be a responsible one or a leading one. This matter should be left entirely to the spirit of the saints and to the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>This is a test to those in a small group who are more exercised before the Lord. Knowing that the church has not assigned anyone to be a responsible or leading one, those who are more exercised should pray in order to follow the Spirit. Anyone with a burden can pray, follow the Spirit, and bear responsibility. This does not involve human arrangements or organizational decisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FAITHFULLY AND DILIGENTLY<br />
COORDINATING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Because the Lord is working in the environment, many saints who have not been meeting for a long time have returned. Although we rejoice in this, it is important that we immediately bear the responsibility to approach and contact them. Even though children do not know very much, they all know if someone is caring for them. If we care for a dormant saint consistently, he will fully trust us. A human being is a human being; he is not made of wood or stone, neither is he a tiger or a lion. Even if he is a terribly fallen person, he is still a human being and still has human feelings. As long as we care for him in the spirit, fellowship with him, and are concerned for him, he will receive our care and protection.</p>
<p>I believe that the young people in particular have a burden for the saints. It is important to respond to this burden. As long as you are concerned about the saints, the work of the Holy Spirit will follow you, and the Lord will confirm His work by raising up someone who matches you. Then you will become a &ldquo;Timothy&rdquo; who can impart the teaching of the apostle into him. After two or three weeks, he will be living and able to enliven others in the small group, and within two or three months the whole group will be brought into a revival.</p>
<p>When a revival comes, the work of the Lord requires little effort. For example, when you visited a dormant brother in the past, he may have ignored you. But when the wind of revival blows, he will be stirred up before you even visit him. As soon as you contact him, he will shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah, brother, the Lord spoke to me of your coming two days ago, and I even dreamed of your coming.&rdquo; Such things have happened.</p>
<p>In Chefoo many doctors and nurses were saved and brought to the church. The director and the pharmacist of one hospital were brothers, but they were not active in the meetings. Nevertheless, they were willing to receive help from the saints. Every Monday morning the saints in the church would meet before going out to visit the saints. They would study a list of names and fellowship about those who should be visited. Then, after touching the Lord to gain an inner sense from Him, they would visit the saints. During one meeting the names of these two brothers were mentioned, but some did not feel that the time was right to visit them. Several weeks later the names of these two brothers were mentioned again, and this time there was a feeling to visit them. This was truly the Lord&rsquo;s leading because both the hospital director and the pharmacist were looking out a window when two brothers arrived to visit them. When they saw the brothers, they were overjoyed and later told the brothers, &ldquo;We saw you coming in a dream last night, so we were waiting for you.&rdquo; As soon as contact was made with the brothers, they were connected to the church again, and no effort was needed to exhort them to come to the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In my whole life I have never been to a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting with such an uplifted atmosphere. We sang <em>Hymns,</em> #101, and we all were touched by the Lord. This atmosphere was the result of the recovery of the hospital director and the pharmacist.</p>
<p>We must believe that the Holy Spirit is always working. Without much effort the small groups can be brought into a revival one by one after two or three months. When the Holy Spirit comes, He works. This work is very marvelous. However, we still need to be faithful and diligent to coordinate with the Lord. Although the hospital director and the pharmacist were very desirous of the Lord, they would not have been gained without the diligence of the church through the weekly visits of the saints. The church must coordinate with the Lord, and the small groups are the means of coordination. We must be faithful and diligent to coordinate with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ARE ADVANCED IN TRUTH AND LIFE<br />
NEEDING TO FUNCTION TO SUPPLY OTHERS</h2>
<p>If we open to the Lord faithfully, the Spirit of the Lord will lead us to be a member who supplies others. Even an elderly sister, who has been saved for many years and who also loves the Lord dearly, can function to supply others with grace. We do not need to wait for the elders to give us a title in order to function. We need to believe that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is with us, and we must rise up to faithfully and diligently to offer our portion.</p>
<p>We all love the Lord and are willing to pay the price because we have a heart; however, we need to take a further step to bear this burden faithfully. On the surface it is a burden, but actually, it is a blessing. In your eyes I am laboring; actually, I am quite joyful because I see so many being saved and so many young people being trained and receiving grace. This is a joy to me. If we all function in the small groups, our small groups will ignite the city of Taipei just like a spark of fire burns through a meadow.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not be timid or proud. Our spirit has to rise up. Once we rise up in spirit, we will not care for outward ways or practices that can cause us to deviate, to be opinionated, and to be divided. We do not care for these things at all. We desire to be fully in the spirit, to love the Lord, to love the church, to love people, and to love the brothers and sisters. As long as we receive a burden in spirit, the blessing will come. Then whomever we touch will be enlivened, whomever we meet will be blessed, and whomever is in our thoughts will be waiting for us when we visit. It is not a small matter when someone dreams of us coming to visit. This was the story of Paul&rsquo;s conversion in the New Testament. When Saul of Tarsus was saved, no one dared to believe that he could be saved because he had persecuted the Lord&rsquo;s church so severely. Then the Lord sent Ananias to seek him out, and while the Lord was conversing with Ananias, He told Ananias that Saul had seen a vision of Ananias&rsquo;s coming while he was praying (Acts 9:10-12). The dream of the hospital director was a similar work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We should all be faithful. We should not say that we have no responsibility because we are not an elder or a deacon. Every person should be in a small group. If we love the Lord and are faithful, we should begin to work in our small group. First, we should build up the small group by being burning and by burning others. After two months of mutual burning, the entire group will be in a revived condition, and even when the saints in the small group see each other in a big meeting, the meeting will be enlivened. Every member in a group must have a sense of responsibility; every person is responsible. However, we must bear in mind that there should not be any competition or rivalry within a group.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Love and Patience</h2>
<p>We all should learn to kindle a fire in the group and also to kindle a fire in order that every brother and sister can be burning. Every recovered brother and sister is tender and delicate; they must be treasured. They cannot be touched casually, or they will be damaged. However, it is not necessary to always let them have their way. In our interaction with them, we must exercise our spirit and have love toward all.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:14 says, &ldquo;We exhort you, brothers, Admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, sustain the weak, be long-suffering toward all.&rdquo; The most touching part of this verse is being &ldquo;long-suffering toward all.&rdquo; When we are with the brothers, we often are quite lacking in patience. Even I need to learn this lesson because it is hard for me when I see the trainees being so sloppy. Sometimes, when I look at their shoes, it seems as if they have not been polished for two or three years. In 1953, when I set up the first formal training here, I trained the brothers to polish their shoes. I spoke a strong word to the trainees, telling them, &ldquo;If your shoes are not well polished, do not expect your work to be carried out in a good way.&rdquo; The brothers and sisters who were being trained at that time are now fifty to sixty years old. They remember the detailed aspects of our training. I often went into their rooms at irregular times and touched their desks or nightstands with my fingers to see if they were dusty; this was part of our training. We should not despise these things. If our shoes are not well polished, should we expect to be able to properly recover a brother?</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting Emphasis on Personality and Character<br />
and Needing to Be Diligent and Faithful</h2>
<p>In 1965 I brought an American brother to the Philippines. He had been a traveling evangelist with some renown before turning to our way. I took him with me to the Philippines because the door to the gospel was quite open there. The saints offered him warm hospitality, putting him in the best room. However, even though he was quite good in preaching the gospel, the character in his living was rather disturbing to others. The brothers who gave him hospitality told me that he made a mess of the house where he stayed; this greatly detracted from the gospel he preached. His gospel preaching was like someone building a house twenty feet high but then tearing it down by ten feet. Although he was a competent speaker and very eloquent, he did not have much fruit in his work. Thus, having much knowledge and great ability does not necessarily mean success. Success depends not only on knowledge and ability but also on character and personality. We need to be diligent and faithful. If we are proper in personality, character, diligence, and faithfulness, we will have success even if we are slightly lacking in knowledge and ability.</p>
<p>We all must bear responsibility in the small group before the Lord and learn to be patient. When we take care of a brother, he may not be helped immediately or even want to receive our help. We should never let this be a source of hurt for us or a point of blame toward him. If we have a quick disposition, desiring quick results, we need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we will be persistent in our prayers. Even if the brothers and sisters we are caring for do not meet our expectations, being anxious concerning them will be of no benefit. In fact, the more anxious we are, the further they will seem to be from our expectations. We need patience.</p>
<p>Patience in a small group is essential because it is not easy for someone to become instantaneously burning. When this is the case, we should not murmur or be disappointed. We have to be long-suffering and patient with endurance. Even if a person has not become burning after six months, we need to continue to labor. We should never say, &ldquo;Forget it! I will let him go; I do not care any longer.&rdquo; Of course, we also should not be stubborn, pressing him to be burning when it is obvious that he is not open to be burning. We need wisdom with regard to our time, neither abandoning him nor being anxious about him. If he is slow to begin to be burning, we should let him be slow for a period of time. In the meantime, we can fan others into flame. After fanning others for a period of time, he may become burning as soon as we focus on him again. We should bring these matters to our fellowship with the Lord so that we can gain a proper sense of His burden and timing.</p><h2 class="head2">Everyone Functioning and<br />
Bearing the Responsibility Faithfully</h2>
<p>The arrangement of the small groups allows everyone to function according to his or her measure. A small group gathering removes every excuse for not functioning. Every small group gathering is a &ldquo;playground&rdquo; for playing ball. As long as there is a playground, no one has an excuse. In the past some may have felt that there was no place to exercise their function. But now one huge playground has become four hundred small playgrounds. There are small playgrounds near every saint. There is no excuse for not playing, but when we play, we should neither overvalue or depreciate our function. The most important thing is that everyone function and bear responsibility faithfully.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising Wisdom and Learning Actively</h2>
<p>I would like to speak of my personal experience. During the first three weeks in August of 1933, there was a tremendous struggle within me concerning whether I should drop my job to serve the Lord full time. During this time, Brother Watchman Nee was sailing back from Europe to China. One day while he was praying in his cabin for the work in China, the Lord gave him a sense to write a letter, telling me that I should serve the Lord full time. He sent this letter to the Shanghai Gospel Bookroom, which redirected the letter to me. My decision was a source of great consternation. At this time I had three children, and even though it did not matter to me whether I starved, I had the responsibility for my wife and children. Then I received Brother Nee&rsquo;s letter in which he said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.&rdquo; Although the note was short, I was deeply touched. Subsequently, I let go of my job to serve the Lord full time and went to Shanghai in October to see Brother Nee.</p>
<p>The co-workers in Shanghai also confirmed my decision to serve full time. When I arrived in Shanghai, everyone I met spoke the Shanghai dialect, whereas I spoke the native dialect of Chefoo in the north. Nevertheless, the co-workers encouraged me to move my family to Shanghai so that I could serve in coordination with them. Later a brother said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are a native of Chefoo, but you are able to come to Shanghai to preach and even work among the Shanghainese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later I came to work in the United States. When I began to give messages, I heard comments that no Chinese preachers had been able to work among Americans except for me. Even though my English was not very good, I was asked about my secret for speaking to Americans. The only secret is to endeavor to learn the particular ways of others. In our learning, we will gain an understanding of their ways that even they may not fully realize. For example, after I arrived in Shanghai, I did not learn much of the Shanghai dialect, but I learned the ways of the Shanghainese. As a result, I could speak convincingly with clear messages that touched the feeling of the Shanghainese.</p>
<p>At the end of May 1961, I began to give messages in English in the United States. After speaking for three years, the Americans said, &ldquo;All those in the church life in the United States speak Mr. Lee&rsquo;s English.&rdquo; Today some American Christian publications also adopt my expressions, such as &ldquo;returning to the spirit.&rdquo; In 1964 the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> published a report about us that was not very accurate. We responded by writing an article to state our standing, and I used the term &ldquo;church practice,&rdquo; realizing that there was no such expression in English. An American brother who taught English said, &ldquo;This is not good English.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;You are right. I know this is not good English, but please tell me what other English words convey this meaning.&rdquo; He thought for a long time but was unable to think of anything; in the end he had to agree with the expression I used.</p>
<p>Not long after that, we published <em>The Stream</em> magazine as well as an English hymnal. For this hymnal I wrote nearly two hundred hymns. There was an American brother who knew music quite well, and he was also very good in poetry. Consequently, he felt that some of my expressions were not very good English. Based on his word, I handed the hymns to him to make corrections. He spent a good amount of time on them, yet he also felt that it was difficult to make corrections. In the end he used many of the original words. Then I told him that literature follows culture. When there is a certain invention in a culture, there will be the need for a new word; that is, there will be the need for an expression to convey the culture&rsquo;s progress. When there are no appropriate words, a word needs to be created. I have had to create new terms because there were no words to express these new developments.</p>
<p>In the past there was not such a thing in Christianity as &ldquo;returning to the spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Returning to the spirit&rdquo; speaks of a new culture; it is a new expression created by us. Several years ago in an institutional publication of a renowned American evangelist, there was an article that even used the term <em>pray-reading.</em> This shows that Christianity also sees a need for new terms. Hence, we should not be conservative; rather, we should endeavor to learn in every aspect. This is the secret of my work. All of us need to learn well.</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Independent Actions<br />
and Absolutely Keeping<br />
the Principle of Coordination in the Body</h2>
<p>Today the Lord&rsquo;s grace is with His recovery, and the Lord is continually bestowing grace on His churches. Now the Lord is leading us in a further step to initiate small groups in the church in Taipei. The needs of the church in Taipei, with thousands of saints, are simply beyond the capacity of the elders. The burden upon them is very heavy; thus, there is an urgent need to have small groups. If group after group is up to the standard, it will be similar to a strong nation with good families and good citizens. When one group after another is raised up in the church, every believer will be strong, and the church will be strong. With the increase, the Spirit will move and guide us. He may arrange an environment to bring us to other cities or may even impart a burden to spread to other countries.</p>
<p>In our functioning in a small group gathering, we must avoid acting independently but do everything in the Body, absolutely keeping the principle of coordination in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING TO SUPPLY OTHERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Letting the Spirit of the Lord<br />
Freely Operate to Release the Lord&rsquo;s Riches and Fulfill His Heart&rsquo;s Desire</h2>
<p>When we function to supply others, we need to let the Spirit of the Lord freely operate. The Lord in us is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17). Once the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit has the freedom to move, the Lord will release His riches and fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire. As we carry out our function, continually learning to exercise our spirit and giving the Lord the freedom in our spirit, He will release His riches through us and fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Burdened to Shepherd, Teach, and Perfect the Young or Weak Saints</h2>
<p>We all must receive a burden to shepherd, teach, and perfect the young or weak brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEMBERS OF A SMALL GROUP NEEDING<br />
TO BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF<br />
TEACHING AND SHEPHERDING</h2>
<p>The brothers and sisters with more experience need to teach and shepherd those who are young or weak. In the small group, no one should be without such care.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Lead Every Person in the Group</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Being Responsible to Seek and<br />
Recover the Dormant Saints</h2>
<p>We need to lead every person in the group to be responsible to seek and recover saints who have not been meeting for a long time and those with whom we have lost contact. For this we should actively review our information cards. According to our current statistics, at least one hundred thousand people were baptized in Taiwan over the last thirty years, with as many as fifty or sixty thousand in the church in Taipei alone. According to the number of those attending meetings, there are less than ten thousand people on the whole island meeting with us. This indicates that we have lost many brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>In the church in Taipei alone more than forty thousand saints have been lost; as far as the whole island is concerned, probably more than ninety thousand people have been lost. Among these ninety thousand saints, at most ten thousand have gone abroad or passed away. Therefore, based on these results, we have lost contact with approximately eighty thousand saints on this island. Recently, I heard many testimonies from those in the small group gatherings concerning recovering saints who have not met with us for twenty or thirty years. We must spend more effort to find these saints. Thus, we propose that every week at least two hundred information cards should be selected, copied, and sent to various meeting halls in Taipei and even to all the churches in Taiwan so that the saints in the small groups can endeavor to find these ones. We hope to locate half of them within one to two years.</p>
<p>We lost these brothers and sister because of errors and shortcomings in our old ways. We should rise up and make amends as quickly as possible. The way to make amends is through the small groups, using the information cards as a base. Although we are greatly encouraged that the church in Taipei has baptized over fifty thousand people in the last twenty-eight years, we must make an effort to find those who have become dormant or lost. Let us pray for this matter. We must endeavor to seek and rescue the saints with whom we have lost contact.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Opening Our Homes to Preach the Gospel<br />
to Our Relatives, Friends, and Neighbors</h2>
<p>We also should open our homes at least once a week to preach the gospel to relatives, friends, and neighbors. When we preach to our relatives, friends, and neighbors we will be able to reap a harvest.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CONTENT OF<br />
THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider a point that is crucial to the small groups. The success and survival of the small groups hinge upon the content of the small group gatherings.</p>
<p>We have heard many encouraging testimonies regarding the small groups. Most of these testimonies speak of the effectiveness of the small groups in recovering the dormant saints. While these testimonies are good, the small groups should do more than specialize in recovering dormant saints. We need to study more aspects so that the small groups can have more functions.</p>
<p>If we start counting from the summer of 1950, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in Taiwan for the past thirty-five years. In these thirty-five years we have baptized more than one hundred thousand believers. Recently, we counted the information cards for the church in Taipei, and there was a total of more than fifty-eight thousand forms. Since the number of saints in the church in Taipei typically makes up half of the total number of saints in the churches in Taiwan, there should be more than one hundred ten thousand saints in Taiwan. However, there are at most fifteen thousand saints who are in the church life in Taiwan at the moment. This shows that there are close to one hundred thousand saints who are not meeting. If we estimate the number of saints who have left the country or passed away to be ten thousand, then there should still be ninety thousand saints that we need to find and bring back to meet with us.</p>
<p>A brother who is a doctor testified that quite a few of the directors in the hospital where he works are brothers who have not met with us for many years. These ninety thousand saints are scattered among Taiwan&rsquo;s eighteen million people, like drops of water in a great lake. We must find them and bring them back. I beg all the churches to pay attention to the information cards. These cards are our gold mines, and we should dig much gold from them.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has more than fifty-eight thousand information cards, but not more than five or six thousand people meet regularly. If we calculate those who have left the country or passed away to be five thousand people, then there are still more than forty-five thousand who need to be located. Therefore, we must exert some effort. We entreat all the meeting halls and group gatherings to pick up this burden and seek out the lost ones. The churches should study their information cards to find those who are not meeting and bring them back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF<br />
THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Retaining the Existing Saints</h2>
<p>There are three matters that must be the focus of our groups. First, we must keep the existing ones. When we preached the gospel and baptized new believers in the past twenty-eight years, we did not have a proper way to retain them. As a result, many of the newly baptized ones left. If half of the fifty-eight thousand people had remained in the church life, the churches would have a completely different look today. Hence, the small groups must focus on retaining the existing ones and not allow them to be lost.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Recovering the Dormant Saints</h2>
<p>Second, in order to recover the dormant saints, we must cooperate with the churches to locate and bring back those for whom we have information cards. This may seem like we are looking for needles in a haystack, but it still must be done. Since they are our family members, we must by all means find them and bring them back. Hence, all the churches on the island need to use the information cards to recover the saints, making an effort to seek them out one by one.</p>
<p>In order to sort the information cards, we need to use computers to establish a clear filing system. The records of the saints who are deceased should be put into one file but should not be discarded or burned; this is our history, and it must be kept in a proper manner. The records of those who have gone abroad must also be sorted out. We should locate where they are living and determine if they are meeting with the church. After we enter this data into the computer, we can know at the touch of a key how many brothers and sisters have passed away, how many have gone abroad, and how many are in other various situations. This is something we need to do urgently.</p>
<p>In addition, we also need to discuss a new publication, <em>New Way and New Doors.</em> We have decided to publish a global church newsletter in English, Chinese, and Spanish. It will be typeset and mailed to different places for printing and distribution. In the first six issues, we will print a global list of more than six hundred local churches, including the date when the saints began to meet in the locality, the number of saints on the name list, and the number of those who meet regularly. [Note: This information was subsequently published separately as <em>A Table of the Churches in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</em> in 1985.] Using the computer to analyze our information cards will be a tremendous help to this effort. The editorial office for this publication will be in Anaheim, where we have both Chinese and English editors. If a church receives a request, please write down the initial and the present condition of the church, the address of its meeting hall, and the number of saints who meet. I believe this will be a great help to the churches throughout the world.</p>
<p>For example, there is a small church in France, and if the brothers and sisters there are able to read <em>New Way and New Doors,</em> they will be very encouraged. Similarly, those who are able see the situation in the more than one hundred churches from Mexico to Argentina will be encouraged as well, and their burden for prayer will increase. In the same way, many will be able to read about the current situation in the churches in Taiwan, and they will be encouraged.</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>Third, we should focus on the preaching of the gospel. We not only need to sustain and retain our existing saints and recover dormant saints, we also need to preach the gospel. Concerning these three matters, we should not focus only on the first matter with the thought that it must be completed before we address the second matter. We must focus on all three matters at the same time. Retaining existing ones, recovering dormant ones, and preaching the gospel are three things that small groups should do at the same time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF<br />
THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Mutual Fellowship</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Flow of the Divine Life</h2>
<p>The content of the small group gatherings involves mutual fellowship. In Greek the word <em>fellowship</em> conveys the meaning of flowing, being in agreement, linking up, and communicating. Hence, fellowship is a flow. For example, the circulation of the blood in the body is a kind of fellowship. Likewise, the electric current in a lamp is a kind of fellowship. When there is no flow of electricity, a lamp stands alone. But once a lamp is connected to the electrical current, it is connected not only to the power plant but also to other lamps.</p>
<p>As believers, we have the Spirit of God and the life of God in us. Today the life of God and the Spirit of God are flowing within us continually. We have this flow, and even those who have not been meeting for a long time have this flow. Many dormant saints say, &ldquo;I have not been meeting for many years, and I am embarrassed to go back.&rdquo; This sense of embarrassment proves that they still have God&rsquo;s life in them; they are still breathing. It also proves that they have the sense of life within them. Hence, there is still hope for them. This hope is related to the flow of life, which is also the fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>When we gather together in the groups, we should believe that the Lord is in our midst. From the day we were saved, He came into us with His life, and He has never left. Furthermore, we can also stand on His promise in Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; We must acknowledge and grasp this privilege.</p>
<p>The small groups are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, not into my name or into your name. When we are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, we have the position to say, &ldquo;Lord, You must be in our midst because this is Your word in Matthew 18:20.&rdquo; We need to learn to speak words based on the spiritual reality. For example, if only three people come to a small group gathering, we should not say, &ldquo;How pitiful! There are only three people in our small group gathering tonight.&rdquo; We must count the Lord Jesus and not forget Him. In doctrine, we know and believe that the Lord is in our midst when we meet. In practice, we need to count the Lord Jesus as one of the attendants. If we do not count Him, our understanding is based on doctrine rather than reality. From now on, when we report our numbers, we should include the Lord Jesus. If we have one hundred eighty people, we should add the Lord Jesus and report one hundred eighty-one. If there are two thousand six hundred eighty, we should add the Lord Jesus and report two thousand six hundred eighty-one. This is not a small matter; we must realize that counting the Lord Jesus makes a world of difference. This is not a matter of doctrine but of practice. When we gather together, He is listening as well as speaking because He is listening and speaking in us. Since He is with us, we should count Him among the number of attendants.</p>
<p>Each time we come to a gathering, it is not to conduct business, not to eat hot pot, and not to make friends or seek assistance. We come to seek the Lord Jesus, that is, to be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. Once we have this faith, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, we thank and praise You. This small gathering is connected to heaven. You are on the throne, in our midst, and even in us.&rdquo; We must have this faith and make this declaration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Enlightened and<br />
Supplied through Fellowship</h2>
<p>Once we make this declaration, we are in the fellowship, just as turning on a lamp switch causes the electrical current to flow and the light to shine in all directions. Once we are in this condition, we will be in the light and not engage in idle talk; rather, we will be able to speak of our real condition spontaneously. For example, a brother may testify, &ldquo;I am truly blessed to participate in this small group. The Lord is with me every day. In our last gathering, a brother said that we should have at least ten minutes of morning watch with five minutes of prayer and five minutes of reading the Bible. I went home and practiced this, and it was truly helpful. Throughout the day I had the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the Lord&rsquo;s word was moving in me continuously. This fellowship has been a real enjoyment to me. In particular, after ten minutes of fellowship with the Lord this morning, I had no desire to argue with my wife. I was truly happy, so I hurried to come here tonight.&rdquo; This is fellowship. When the brother finishes speaking, we should not merely nod our head and smile, thinking that this testimony is good but not saying anything. We need to see that fellowship is not one-way traffic. Others should spontaneously continue to share. We need to learn in this matter. A young sister may offer a prayer: &ldquo;O Lord, may You give us grace so that, like this brother, we can all grow in life.&rdquo; This two-way traffic is fellowship; in this way everyone is supplied.</p>
<p>Mutual fellowship is truly better than merely listening to messages. Listening to messages is similar to eating only white rice during a meal; there is not much variety in flavor. When we have a meal, we always have other dishes in addition to white rice. The two-way traffic in fellowship is similar to pickled vegetables, which stimulate one&rsquo;s appetite during a meal. After the young sister has prayed, the Spirit may lead everyone to pray one after another, or another brother may say, &ldquo;I can testify that this is absolutely true. I have been practicing praying for five minutes and reading the Word for five minutes in the morning for several months. I feel very blessed, and now I want to begin to pray for ten minutes and read the Word for ten minutes.&rdquo; This testimony will be a strengthening. The fellowship that follows could be endless. There may be strengthening prayers or testimonies that follow one after another. Following this fellowship, the entire gathering will open up. After half an hour of fellowship, everyone will be full and satisfied, and when they part, they will yearn for the next meeting.</p><h2 class="head3">Being according to the Spirit,<br />
Not according to Religious Rituals</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s grace in us is rich. However, since we have not been adequately trained and lack exercise and practice, we are accustomed to attending worship &ldquo;services&rdquo; and sitting. From an early age I went to Sunday worship services with my mother. Once we entered the chapel, we would simply sit down. Christianity requires believers to sit. When I was in elementary school, all the students were required to dress neatly on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and then go to school to wait for the teachers&rsquo; arrival. Once the teachers arrived, they led us to Sunday school to sit in small pews and then to the big chapel to sit in large pews. This was truly a suffering to me because I wanted to play soccer, but instead I had to go and sit in a pew.</p>
<p>Today we are under this influence to sit whenever we meet. Sitting does not require any learning or practice. It is common for Christians all over the world to attend and sit through a service, because we have not been trained to meet according to the Spirit. For instance, in large gatherings two young brothers lead the singing of hymns and the reading of the Bible from the podium. As a result, the singing and the reading are very orderly. Nevertheless, why is it necessary for them to be on the podium? This is a religious ritual. Can they not simply rise from their seats and read? They can surely rise from their seats and say, &ldquo;We will read Acts 2:42.&rdquo; This would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also possible to turn a practice of not going to the podium to sing hymns and to read the Word into a religious ritual. We must realize that religious rituals are part of our very constitution. The only way to be delivered from religious rituals is to be according to the spirit. In our spirit we know whether or not we are meeting according to religious rituals because things of religion cannot enliven people or gain people. Every time we meet, we should stand against our religious constitution; instead, we should do everything according to the spirit, including singing, praying, and testifying. If we can grasp this principle and practice it, our small groups will definitely have a future.</p>
<p>Let me give another example. Suppose a brother who has not met for a long time comes back and says, &ldquo;I have not met for twenty years, but I have a favorite hymn, &lsquo;Jesus loves me, this I know.&rsquo;&rdquo; Although he has called a hymn, it is not in our hymnal. What should we do? Should we say, &ldquo;This hymn is not in our hymnal, so let us not sing it&rdquo;? If we did this, he would be stumbled. We need to exercise our spirit because there are many situations in the small groups that can never be handled by applying regulations. Rather than saying anything to the brother, we also could be silent, using the excuse that since there is no leader or responsible one in the small group, we should do nothing. This would be like throwing cold water on him, and it would not be proper. Again, we should exercise our spirit and pray inwardly, &ldquo;O Lord, what should we do?&rdquo; I have had this experience; when we look to the Lord, He will lead us. Perhaps He may give someone the leading to say, &ldquo;Those of us who know this hymn can sing together, and those of us who do not know it can learn.&rdquo; This will comfort the brother&rsquo;s heart. Although &ldquo;Jesus loves me, this I know&rdquo; is a very shallow hymn, it will be very sweet, and the brother will be recovered if everyone sings in the spirit. If no one knows this hymn, someone can say, &ldquo;Brother, if you tell us the first stanza, we will follow along.&rdquo; This hymn can be like a drop of dew that brings in a river. After singing, someone can follow with a prayer: &ldquo;Lord, we thank You! You love our brother, and You love every one of us. Today we are enjoying Your love.&rdquo; Although this is a small matter, it can turn into a flow of living water.</p>
<p>Although I have written outlines concerning the small group gatherings, all of these are merely principles; the practice is entirely a matter of being in the spirit. The fellowship in the small groups must be living. From this fellowship we can know a brother&rsquo;s situation, problems, and burdens so that everyone can intercede and share the burden. Our responses must always follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We do not necessarily need to shed tears every time we hear someone&rsquo;s problems. Even the expression of our love must be a matter in the spirit. All that I have written in the outlines and spoken in this meeting is in the nature of fellowship; when the time comes, we must do everything according to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Singing Hymns and Praying</h2>
<p>The content of the small group gatherings also includes singing hymns and praying. In Christian meetings there will be singing and praying, but we should not treat these as rituals or forms. When Christians meet today, they sing, then pray, and at the conclusion they sing and pray again. These are all religious rituals. In our Christian meetings we also sing and pray, but sometimes we do not sing a hymn. However, it is rare when there are no prayers, because we have a spirit that needs to breathe, and prayer is our breathing. It would be difficult to meet for one to two hours without any prayer; this would suffocate us. Prayer may be in the form of thanking, praising, extolling, or petitioning. In any case, whether we are singing or praying, there should be no regulations or rituals.</p>
<p>In the small group gatherings we do not need to wait for everyone to arrive in order to call a hymn. This indicates that our singing is a ritual. In large meetings in Christianity arrangements are made beforehand to have &ldquo;Pastor So-and-so&rdquo; call a hymn and &ldquo;Doctor So-and-so&rdquo; lead the prayer. We must not allow the singing and praying in our small groups to follow this pattern. If three or five persons are gathered and have a genuine burden to sing hymns, they should sing hymns. Singing hymns should be according to inspiration and the mood of the gathering. If there is no inspiration or mood to sing, there is no need to sing. The same principle applies to praying. We should not turn singing and praying into rituals. For example, we can offer praise and thanks to God for His many answers to prayer since the group last gathered. At the same time that we are giving thanks and praise to the Lord, we can let our requests be made known to God, and there can be prayers related to the execution of God&rsquo;s will and the accomplishment of the Lord&rsquo;s work. If the Spirit moves and leads us in this direction during our gatherings, we should follow the Spirit. These matters are not rituals.</p><h2 class="head2">Supplying the Word</h2>
<p>The small group gatherings should also have the supply of the word as their content. This is the life pulse of the group gatherings, and while it is the most important item in a Christian meeting, it is often the most difficult item. However, the Lord&rsquo;s word among us is not scarce. Volume after volume of Life-studies have opened the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. As long as we spend a few minutes every morning to read two or three verses with their footnotes and three to five paragraphs of a related Life-study message, we will be filled with a supply. Over the course of a year, we will build up a great deposit of the truth in us. Then when we attend the group gatherings, the Spirit will guide us to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>In the small group gatherings the supply of the word must be focused on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the Triune God becoming flesh, passing through human living, death on the cross, and resurrection from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit to dispense Himself into every believer so that we can become the children of God and the members of Christ as His Body. This is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This does not mean that we must recite this statement every time we meet. We can speak about many points in the Bible, but our focus must be on the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people.</p>
<p>One time a local church invited me to preach the gospel. The title of one of the messages was &ldquo;The Triune God Dispensing Himself into the Tripartite Man,&rdquo; and I spoke from Romans 8. Some may think that this topic is too deep and that many would not understand it, but such a thought only shows how much we underestimate people&rsquo;s capacity to receive. The truth of the tripartite nature of man is a proof that man has the capacity to receive the dispensing of the Triune God, and for this dispensing, there must be a God-given capability for man to understand and to contact God. We must change our concept and not think that others cannot understand; rather, we must see that it is our limited ability to speak that hinders people from understanding and receiving the supply of the word. If we know how to speak, people will understand.</p>
<p>When I first heard about computers, I could not grasp the concept of a computer. After I gained some understanding about computers, I discovered that even a ten-year-old child knows how to use a computer. I did not understand computers, but even a ten-year-old child knows the difference between software and hardware. When my grandchildren received a computer, they plugged it in and immediately started playing with it. When I saw this, I was amazed and encouraged. Based on my remembrance of this experience, I decided to speak on &ldquo;The Triune God Dispensing Himself into the Tripartite Man&rdquo; when I preached the gospel that day. I spoke about the Triune God and about the tripartite man, and the people listened with keen interest and understanding. Hence, we should never say that people in a group gathering will not understand our speaking related to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. People will understand if our speaking is adequate. While they may not appear to understand, they will understand after hearing it again and again. We should not underestimate people. Man was created by God with three parts, and even though man has a mind and a body, he also has a spirit to contact God.</p>
<p>For this reason, we need to cultivate our understanding of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This does not require much effort. With just ten minutes every day over a period of a year, we will accumulate a considerable amount. We must be truthful with the Lord. Since we love Him, we should practice a life of enjoying Him. In the morning watch, we should spend five minutes to pray and five minutes to read the Word, and then gradually increase our prayer to ten minutes and our reading of the Word to ten minutes. Everyone can pay this price. If we have such an exercise every morning, we will definitely have a supply for others in the group gatherings. Furthermore, we have many spiritual books and publications. For the past eleven years, these publications have all been focused on God&rsquo;s economy. Line by line and point by point, they all speak concerning God&rsquo;s economy, which is God&rsquo;s desire to dispense Himself into His chosen people. If we are willing to make the effort to obtain the material from these books, we will be faithful ministers of the word.</p>
<p>Our speaking should not be loose and without structure; we must have a clear line and a definite emphasis. This requires practice. As long as we have the heart and are willing to learn, everyone in the meetings can speak the word, but the speaking must have a line and a focus.</p>
<p>We must avoid speaking about things that are different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The Bible speaks of &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We must learn to speak concerning things such as these, which are related to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and not speak different teachings. In this regard, it is best to use the Life-studies. When I say this, I am not speaking like a melon-seller who exaggerates the sweetness of his melons. Last year a few brothers wrote me a letter saying that they had compared the Life-studies to several other expository books. After much comparison, they acknowledged that the Life-studies were higher, richer, and deeper. When I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the Bible, I read many expository books. I am standing on their shoulders, so I know that the Life-studies are higher. What these expositions have, I also have, but what I have, they do not have. This is only because they came before me; some were written two hundred years ago, and others were written one hundred years ago. The light they have cannot be compared to the light we have today. Even an ordinary electrician has greater knowledge about electrical lights than Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. Hence, I advise you to save your money and not buy so many reference books and to save your eyesight and time, because the essence of all the useful expositions is in the Life-studies and footnotes of the Recovery Version of the Bible. I have studied all the famous expositors in Christianity, and I have also spent nearly eleven years writing in order to finally complete the work of the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies. These are the best materials to use in the small groups.</p>
<p>Recently the serving ones at the ministry office in the United States selected some precious quotations from the Life-studies and the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the Bible and framed them. When I read these words, I could not help asking myself, &ldquo;Did I say this? Did I write this?&rdquo; If the source had not been cited, I would hardly have believed that I wrote them. The treasure within them is too rich. A footnote is often written by compiling the main points from ten books. Sometimes a very long footnote required a week to write. Not only did I read the original text to find the meaning of a particular word in a verse, but I also read the comments of well-known writers on the same verse. Furthermore, I also added my own consideration. These tasks often took a considerable amount of effort. All of you are my family, so I can tell you the work that I have done; it is definitely worth your effort to extract the riches from the Life-studies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Perfecting Every Believer</h2>
<p>The group gatherings should always have a goal of perfecting every believer to know and speak the truth, to grow in life and increase in spiritual stature, to live in the Body, be built up together, and live the church life, and to spread the gospel and save sinners. In other words, there are four main items: truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</p>
<p>I hope that after one or two years, everyone who participates in the small group gatherings will be able to speak the truth, to testify concerning their growth in life, to live the church life, and to preach the gospel. Truth, life, the church, and the gospel are the goal of our small group gatherings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG GIFTS, OFFICES,<br />
AND CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Prayer: O Lord, we come before You and also come to Your Word by Your precious blood. Lord, we are truly for You, and we gather around Your Word, looking to You that You may give us light. Open up Your Word to us, and may light from Your Word illuminate our whole being. We do not want to remain in darkness, the natural realm, or religion. We truly desire to enter into Your revelation. May each one of us see the light. Your word is a light to our path and a lamp to our feet. Lord, thank You for leading us on the way of the recovery. Step by step and year after year, You have been leading us. You have not left us in darkness or let us go astray.</p>
<p>Lead us so that we can follow and have the assurance in our spirit that we are walking in the light. Lord, speak to us again. Give us a sober mind and grant us an open spirit. Cause us to be poor in spirit so that we would not be content or think that we have sufficient knowledge. Lord, we are still very poor in our knowledge of You, in our knowing of Your Word, and in our entering into the light in Your word. Visit us so that the hungry will be satisfied and the poor will be supplied with riches. Lord, thank You for Your precious blood that always cleanses us and covers us. Be with us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BASIC TRUTHS CONCERNING<br />
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship some basic truths concerning the administration of the church in the New Testament. We need to have a new understanding of the administration of the church, because it concerns our household administration. Since the church is our home, there should be a household administration. These truths relate to the economy of God, and this new understanding of the administration of the church is based on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Economy of God Having Two Aspects&mdash;<br />
Life and Administration</h2>
<p>The economy of God has two aspects: an inward aspect as it relates to life and an outward aspect as it relates to administration. The church also reflects the inward aspect of life and the outward aspect of administration. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy comprises both life and administration. Every man has a body for outward activities, but he also has an inward constitution related to his spirit and soul. Our body is for outward activities, but our spirit and soul constitute our real inner man. Although the genuineness of the church rests on the inward aspect of life, there is a need for the aspect of outward administration. Without this aspect the church would be like a person who has a spirit and soul but no body. Hence, it is easy to deviate from the economy of God if we speak of the church only in purely spiritual terms while neglecting its administration. Consequently, the economy of God includes both the outward aspect of administration as well as the inward aspect of life.</p>
<p>According to statistics published by some Christian denominations in the Far East, the Presbyterian Church has the largest number of members on the island of Taiwan with over eighty thousand. The local churches rank second with about forty-five thousand, and the True Jesus Church ranks third with about twenty thousand. Over the past twenty-eight years we have focused primarily on spirituality. We became so spiritual that we did not pay any attention to how many were born into our family. According to statistics provided by the brothers, we baptized fifty-eight thousand people in Taipei alone; this figure does not include other cities. Since the number of people saved in the church in Taipei typically comprises half of the people saved on the island, there could be as many as one hundred ten thousand believers among us on the island of Taiwan. According to this figure, we far outnumber the Presbyterian Church; this is a very precious fact to me. Regrettably, this information also shows that we have gained spirits and souls but not many bodies over the past twenty-eight years. We have been so spiritual that we do not even know the exact number of people born into our family.</p>
<p>In our effort to be spiritual, we have nurtured our spirit so that it could be strong, but our body is very weak. If we had paid more attention to this matter in just the last fifteen years, our situation would be vastly different. However, we failed to notice that something was lacking in our work. We were constantly preaching the gospel, saving and baptizing many, but our way of bringing them into the church was like pouring water into a bucket with many holes. As a result, close to one hundred thousand &ldquo;drops of water&rdquo; are no longer in our bucket; that is, they no longer meet with us.</p>
<p>Currently, brothers and sisters who meet with us are working in every level of society and in every Taiwanese institution; this is good. Nevertheless, we know little concerning the situation of the believers who are not currently meeting with us. This shows that we have been irresponsible in our care. We are like parents who have abandoned their children. We do not know where our children are living or even if they are still alive.</p>
<p>In order to have an accurate knowledge of the number and the condition of our brothers and sisters, we should use the information cards and establish the small groups. Many have testified that they have discovered a brother here and another brother there. One brother even testified that when he visited others, he would ask them if they used to meet in a district. If they responded by naming a certain district, he knew that they were our brothers and sisters, our family members.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who have been baptized by us are scattered throughout Taiwan and even overseas. There are Chinese students in all the major universities in the United States. Many of these Chinese students are involved in Chinese-speaking Christian groups, and many of the leading ones in these groups are brothers who met with us at one time. Our water has leaked out to many places. So many of these brothers were nurtured by us in Taiwan. It is a pity that they are completely dispersed.</p><h2 class="head2">The Authority of Elders in the Local Churches</h2>
<p>The truth concerning the administration of the church is related primarily to the limitations on the authority of the elders in a local church. This is a great matter. In the administration of a country, it is essential to know how much authority has been given to the president, how much has been given to the legislature, and how much has been given to various government institutions. If each institution does not recognize its limitations, there will be trouble, and the country will suffer. Similarly, we need to know this fundamental point as it relates to the administration of the church, because the Lord is leading us to have a new beginning, and we need to make a thorough effort to advance the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Such an advance will involve the move of the co-workers as well as the authority of the elders, and unless we are clear concerning the administration of the church, there will be problems.</p>
<p>As members of the household of God, we should know the arrangement of our household administration. Then we will act properly and not overstep our measure. At the same time, those who bear some administrative responsibility have an even greater need to know the limits of their authority so that they do not restrict or hinder others. This is very much related to our service.</p>
<p>For example, the church in Taipei has more than twenty halls and over four hundred small groups. Consequently, we need to know how those who are in these small groups should move in relation to those who bear responsibilities for the practical and even spiritual aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s move, including the elders and deacons and those who function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Furthermore, we need to know how the administration of the elders and the service of the deacons can be coordinated with the development of these gifts. We need to be clear concerning these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCENTRATING TO ENTER INTO THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Although the Bible does not leave us in darkness, the Bible was not written like a manual of guidelines. Every governmental agency relies upon such a manual, but the Bible was written from the perspective of God. When we read it, we can pick up a point here and another point there, but we must put them together in order to see something. I hope that we all would concentrate when we read the outlines that have been prepared. If we have a sober mind when we read them, they will be perfectly clear and easily remembered. The elderly saints should not make an excuse that they are too old to remember these points. No matter how old we are, we still need to exercise our mind. If the elderly saints are attentive, their mind will become more focused, and these points will be easily remembered. Although an elderly person may be slow in understanding, once something enters into his memory, it will not easily be forgotten. We all must concentrate in order to enter into these basic truths</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Placing Some in the Church:<br />
First Apostles, Second Prophets, Third Teachers<br />
and Then Helps and Administrations</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then...helps, administrations.&rdquo; <em>Helps</em> refers to the deacons, and <em>administrations</em> refers to the elders. According to our concept, elders should come before deacons. Paul, however, first mentions helps and then administrations. This verse shows an order to the various gifts. Paul begins, saying, &ldquo;First apostles, second prophets, third teachers...&rdquo; He uses the words <em>first, second,</em> and <em>third</em> in the first half of the verse, but no sequential numbers are used in the second half of the verse, although there is a clear sense of order. We absolutely believe that Paul was inspired by the Holy Spirit to put <em>helps</em> before <em>administrations,</em> knowing that it would be easy for people to highly regard and exalt the elders.</p>
<p>After Paul&rsquo;s departure, a teacher named Ignatius emerged in the second century. He committed a serious error by teaching that overseers are higher than elders. In fact, the words <em>elder</em> and <em>overseer</em> refer to the same person, with <em>elder</em> denoting a person of maturity and <em>overseer</em> denoting the function of an elder. Ignatius&rsquo;s erroneous view influenced the church and produced a hierarchy, a religious system. An overseer became a bishop of a geographic area that contained more than one local church, and thus he &ldquo;oversaw&rdquo; the elders of several local churches. Eventually, elders were promoted to be bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and even popes. Thus, this hierarchy produced a religious system.</p>
<p>I believe that when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians 12, the Holy Spirit was working specifically to invalidate the notion of hierarchy. We should not have a concept of rank. The elders are not higher than the deacons. Just as the eldership is an office, the deaconship is also an office, each having particular responsibilities and functions. The elders take care of administration, and deacons take care of service. They differ only in function. Thus, we should not bring in the concept of position and rank in any form.</p><h2 class="head2">Gifts Functioning in the Aspect of Ministry<br />
for the Supply of Truth and Life</h2>
<p>Our concept about the order of the various functions in the administration of the church is completely the opposite of what is shown in verse 28. At the beginning of this verse the apostle Paul uses the words <em>first, second,</em> and <em>third,</em> but he does not use sequential numbering in the second half of the verse because he is speaking of two categories of service. The first category, which includes apostles, prophets, and teachers, is unrelated to the administration of the church; it is related entirely to supplying truth and life (Eph. 4:11). The second category, which includes helps and administrations, is related to the administration of church affairs.</p>
<p>Therefore, gifts function in the aspect of ministry, which is related to the supply of truth and life. These three gifts&mdash;apostles, prophets, and teachers&mdash;supply truth and life, although there are differences in their various functions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Offices Functioning<br />
in the Aspect of Administration<br />
for the Overseeing and Leading of a Local Church</h2>
<p>Offices function in the aspect of administration, which is related solely to overseeing and leading the church. The elders oversee and lead the church; this is purely a function related to administration (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Apostles Being Gifts for the Universal Church and<br />
Appointing Elders and Deacons</h2>
<p>Apostles are gifts to the universal church. In the Bible we cannot find a local church that has its own apostle, because an apostle functions to supply all the members of the universal church. However, an apostle also appoints elders and deacons (Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 3:1-13). Thus, apostles first supply truth and life and then appoint elders and deacons.</p>
<p>In terms of office, there are apostles and then elders and deacons, and in terms of gift, there are apostles and then prophets and teachers. The apostles serve in both the aspect of office and the aspect of gift. However, whether in terms of office or gift, the function of the apostles is universal, not local.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prophets and Teachers<br />
Being Gifts to the Local Churches,<br />
Releasing the Revelation of God<br />
and Supplying the Mystery of the Truth</h2>
<p>Prophets and teachers are gifts to the local churches. Hence, Acts 13:1 says, &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.&rdquo; The Scripture text here does not mention apostles. In the gatherings of the local churches, there are prophets and teachers. Thus, prophets and teachers are gifts to the local churches for the release of the revelation of God and the supply of the mystery of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Being Only Prophets and Teachers<br />
in the Meetings of a Local Church,<br />
Not Apostles, Elders, or Deacons</h2>
<p>There are only prophets and teachers in the meetings of a local church. Prophets are referred to in 1 Corinthians 14:4-5. Verse 26 which speaks of each one having a psalm, also speaks of having a teaching and having a revelation. Teaching comes from teachers, and revelation comes from prophets. Prophets are different from teachers. A prophet is inspired by the Spirit and receives revelation from God; hence, the word that is released is a revelation. In the New Testament a prophet mainly speaks for God and speaks forth God through the revelation of God. Sometimes, however, a prophet can be inspired to give a prediction (Acts 11:27-28). In 1 Corinthians 14 the main function of a prophet is not to predict but to speak for God. Prophets speak for God. The word of the prophet is not an ordinary teaching; it is a word based on revelation from God.</p>
<p>The teachings of a teacher are mainly for the defining of doctrine, such as the truth related to justification by faith and sanctification. The teachers need to learn to give a clear explanation of justification, sanctification, and so forth. This is like a chief justice of a country who gives a clear judicial interpretation of the law. Teachers define doctrines and truths according to the revelation in the Word; they define the meaning of such things as regeneration, the mingling of God and man, the principle of incarnation, and the economy of God. Prophets receive revelation, whereas teachers define the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth. In a meeting of a local church, there are prophets and teachers but not apostles, elders, and deacons. This does not mean that there are no elders and deacons in a local church, but no one functions as an apostle, elder, or deacon in a <em>meeting</em> of a local church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Elders and Deacons Attending the Meetings<br />
of a Local Church Not as Officers but as Brothers</h2>
<p>When an elder comes to a church meeting, he should attend the meeting as a brother, not as an elder. This is because there are no elders, deacons, or apostles in the meetings of a local church. Even when an apostle attends a meeting, he should attend as a brother. We need to be clear about this. Clearly, the Bible speaks of elders who teach (1 Tim. 5:17), but this function of teaching in a local church can be likened to a parent who privately tutors his children at home. This is different from teaching in a school. The elders&rsquo; teaching of the saints in a locality is similar to parents teaching their children at home, and the teaching in a church meeting is similar to the teaching in a classroom. The elders&rsquo; teaching is in the pattern of parent&rsquo;s teaching, and the teaching in a meeting is more in the pattern of a schoolteacher&rsquo;s teaching. Even if the elders have a burden to speak a word in a meeting, it should still be like the teaching that comes from a parent who is tutoring his children at home.</p>
<p>This difference between these two types of teaching is often manifested when an elder goes from one locality to another. Although he seems to be able to teach the saints in one locality, he has difficulty teaching saints in another locality. However, anyone who has the genuine gift of teaching will be able to teach wherever he goes because teaching is his profession. Many fathers can help their children learn mathematics at home, but this does not qualify them to be a mathematics teacher in a high school; there is a difference. A person can have some knowledge of mathematics, history, and geography, but this does not qualify him to be a teacher.</p>
<p>Those who teach in the meetings of the church should be like teachers who teach students in school. However, when the elders teach, their teaching should be like the guidance of a parent who is teaching his children at home. There are two kinds of elders in a locality: those who can administrate with respect to general affairs, and those who can teach through shepherding. Some elders are good at administrating the general affairs of the church, and others labor in word and teaching (v. 17). These two kinds of elders can be compared to the parents in a family; while the mother tutors her children in mathematics, history, and English, the father is responsible for the management and governance of the family.</p><h2 class="head2">Gifts Needing to Endeavor<br />
to Develop Their Spiritual Capacity<br />
So That the Church Can Increase and Spread</h2>
<p>Those who function as a prophet or teacher should endeavor to develop their spiritual capacity so that the church can increase and spread. Whether one is in a local church, in a district, or in a small group, those with the function of a prophet or teacher should endeavor to develop this gift to expand their spiritual capacity so that the church can increase and spread the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Elders Needing to Endeavor to Coordinate<br />
with the Gifts for the Propagation<br />
in Their Administration<br />
of General Affairs</h2>
<p>The elders need to endeavor to coordinate with the gifts for the propagation in their administration of the general affairs of the church. Since the small groups provide an environment for everyone to exercise his or her talents, the gifts of many saints will be manifested. In the development of these gifts, many people will be saved and there will be much propagation. Within a very short time a small group will double and become two small groups, and the number of people will increase. When the number of people increases to the point that a meeting hall should be built, the elders need to address this matter related to the administration of a local church. It is the responsibility of the elders to take care of matters such as purchasing land, planning, and drawing up the budget. The elders also need to have insight. Once they notice that the gifts in a certain district are developing in a very positive manner and that many people are being saved, they need to quickly purchase land to build a meeting hall. On the administrative side, the elders need to endeavor to coordinate in general affairs as the gifts develop.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Elders Needing to Strictly Oversee<br />
the Move of the Local Churches,<br />
but Not Intentionally or Unintentionally Restricting the Proper Move<br />
and Propagation of the Gifts</h2>
<p>Elders also need to strictly oversee the move of the local churches. The elders should not think that they can take an extended time of rest, like animals going into hibernation, since there are small groups and since in each small group spiritual gifts are being developed. The elders certainly have suffered very much in the past, even to the point of being worn out. Now that the burden can be shared among four hundred small groups, it seems as if the elders can live in ease and comfort because things have become much simpler. The elders must not think in this way. They must realize that the responsibility of the elders will only increase as the small groups multiply. As the small groups multiply and develop, the saints will increasingly speak of the need for additional meeting halls. The elders cannot be negligent in this matter; they should be like a &ldquo;Combined Logistics Team&rdquo; that supplies the needs of the military. In a war, the military forces should be provided with supplies when they call headquarters for help. If they are not provided with supplies, the Combined Logistics Team is being negligent. The Combined Logistics Team cannot replace the military forces in fighting the battle, nor should they restrict the advancement of the military forces. Instead, the Combined Logistics Team needs to be aware of the situation and be swift to respond to the needs of the advancing military forces. It should consider the interests of the military forces and prepare the needed supplies.</p>
<p>We were not so clear concerning this matter in the past. Consequently, the authority of the elders might have restricted the development of the gifts, but some of these gifts also did not stay within the bounds of their measure and encroached upon the duties of the elders. As the elders exercise their responsibility for oversight, they should be careful not to restrict the development of the gifts or hinder them from propagating. The elders&rsquo; function is not to propagate but to be a &ldquo;Combined Logistics Team&rdquo; ready to supply. According to Ephesians 4, there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. These ones should endeavor to exercise and develop their capacity, to propagate, to edify others, to lead others, to revive others, and to establish others. Then spontaneously the kingdom of God will spread. This relates to spiritual matters. However, in relation to general affairs, there is the need for local administration in order to respond to various practical needs. This is not the responsibility of the gifts but of the elders.</p>
<p>If the elders notice that a certain small group is not on the track of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, they should both oversee and intervene. The elders should strictly oversee the move of the local churches so that they progress in a proper way according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and are not led astray by different teachings. However, they should be careful to not restrict or kill the proper move and propagation of the gifts either intentionally or unintentionally. We should each remain in our proper place; the gifted ones should go out to propagate, and those in the eldership should actively coordinate with them in general affairs.</p>
<p>There presently is a need for a meeting hall for the church in Taipei. The small groups are being promoted, and I believe that the capacity of our meeting halls will not be sufficient. Therefore, the elders must keep their eyes wide open, their view must be broadened, and they must quickly purchase land and build a bigger meeting hall. This requires long-term plans. Of course, they can fellowship with the gifted ones to discuss future plans and a budget. Once these have been completed, they can report to the saints so that everyone can begin to make regular offerings to meet the demands that will develop from the positive results of our future propagation. We should not raise money at the last minute but begin making preparations in advance. This is a matter for the elders to address. The elders need to constantly watch the development and propagation of the gifts so that they can be prepared to coordinate in a timely manner.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>We should be clear concerning gifts and offices: In terms of gifts there are first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers. In terms of offices there are first apostles, then helps (deacons), and then administrations (elders). In a meeting there are only prophets and teachers who release revelation as well as teach to edify and establish those who attend the meeting. In the meetings those who have the function and office of apostles, elders, and deacons are only brothers.</p>
<p>Those who are gifts should endeavor to develop their spiritual capacity so that there can be a continual propagation and so that those who have been gained can be established. This will bring in the increase and spread of the church. Those who have responsibility for administration should broaden their view and actively prepare to coordinate in general affairs related to the propagation. In this way, no one will overstep, and no one will restrict others.</p>
<p>In the past, due to the lack of a clear understanding, there was an overstepping in some areas that caused both sides to be restricted in their function. I hope that in the future the gifts will be developed even more, and the offices will be strengthened even more so that the church may gain increase in every locality. This fellowship is like our house rules. When there are house rules, the father, mother, and siblings in the family know what is expected of them and thus are able to fulfill their family duties. When we carry out our responsibilities in an orderly way, the church will spread step by step, and the Lord will have a way to go forward.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You from the depths of our being. By Your grace You have visited us, called us, and separated us from this evil age. Lord, when we see so many brothers and sisters meeting every day, we know that You are doing a work of grace in our heart. We look to You that Your work within us would be deeper and weightier every day.</p>
<p>Teach us to truly know that we are one spirit with You. We believe that You are among us; we declare that You are with us. We have a spirit, and we have Your Spirit in our spirit; these two have become one. We want to exercise our spirit to speak and to listen. Reveal Your words, heart&rsquo;s desire, and hidden mysteries. We want to be freed from oldness, traditions, and everything of the past; we want to live in freshness. Lord, grant us instant light, and speak a fresh word to us. May Your Spirit impart Your thoughts, feelings, and words so that we would touch Your presence and so that we would also sense that You have touched the depths of our being.</p>
<p>Lord, we worship You that You are with us. You promised that if we kept Your teaching, You would be with us until the consummation of the age. Therefore, we believe that You are speaking to us and that You are here with us. Cause every one of us to lift up our spirit to worship You and to open our heart to thank You.</p>
<p>Lord, we truly desire to receive rich grace from You again. Supply us individually, and supply all the churches. Supply all those who are under Your name; we know that there are still thousands of brothers and sisters in this city who are not meeting with us. We pray for them, just as You prayed for them. And Lord, just as You have visited us, we ask that You would visit them. May Your light shine upon them through us, and may Your truth reach them through us so that they would see the light, know the truth, and walk in the way of life.</p>
<p>Lord, destroy the enemy, destroy the demons, destroy Babylon, and destroy human organization. Release Your children, save Your Body, and strengthen Your testimony. In Your victorious name we bind the evil one. We stand on Your promise to trample serpents and scorpions under our feet. We curse the evil one, and we rebuke him before Your throne. Lord, we stretch out our hands of faith to touch the throne of Your authority, to destroy the authority of darkness, to rescue Your church, and to build up Your Body. You have overcome, and You will overcome unto eternity. Conquer our disposition, naturalness, and self. Glorify Your name; only You are able to protect Your glory. Lord, we truly worship You. We beseech You to speak to us again. Lord Jesus, we exalt Your name, call on Your name, extol Your name, and praise Your name, which is above every name. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETINGS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning meetings. According to our concept, meetings are something very ordinary. In the Bible, however, meetings are not an ordinary matter. Meetings are first mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 18:20, following the Lord Jesus&rsquo; reference to the church in verse 17, which speaks of telling a matter to the church. In verse 20 He said, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; In these two verses there are three matters: the church, the meetings, and the Lord&rsquo;s presence. These three things are interrelated. Where there is a church, there should be meetings; where there are meetings, the Lord is present in our midst.</p>

<p>The Old Testament shows that God&rsquo;s people lived a life of meeting. The greatest type in the Old Testament is the type of the called race of Israel. God did not save the Israelites individually; their salvation was a corporate salvation. Every household of Israel kept the Passover at the same time, and together they crossed the Red Sea, journeyed through the wilderness, and reached the good land. They journeyed through the wilderness, reached the foothills of Mount Sinai, and set up their camps together. From the night of the Passover, no one in the called race of Israel lived individualistically. They lived a meeting life, and they moved as an assembly (Acts 7:38).</p>
<p>At the base of Mount Sinai the whole assembly of the children of Israel gathered before God, who descended upon Mount Sinai and called Moses up to the mountaintop to reveal the pattern of the tabernacle to him. This was a kind of meeting. Even the building of the tabernacle at the base of the mountain was not an individual work but a corporate work, the work of the assembly. All the Israelites built the tabernacle of God with each tribe doing its part.</p>
<p>After the tabernacle of God was built, the whole assembly of Israel set out and journeyed onward. Even when they were moving forward, they walked together as an assembly. No Israelite acted individually. Rather, all the people of Israel moved corporately as an assembly. Moreover, God&rsquo;s leading was unique&mdash;a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. At that time there were at least two million Israelites, including men and women, young and old. Even though there were many Israelites, there was only one pillar of cloud by day and one pillar of fire by night. God&rsquo;s leading did not involve two million pillars of cloud and fire. The children of Israel were a corporate people, not scattered individuals, and their entire living was a meeting life.</p><h2 class="head2">Early New Testament Church Meetings</h2>
<p>The Israelites in the Old Testament are a type of the church in the New Testament. When the church began in the New Testament, there were only one hundred twenty disciples plus the Lord Jesus. On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were added to the church (Acts 2:41). Thus, the number of the Lord&rsquo;s believers became three thousand one hundred twenty, and they immediately started to live a meeting life. Verse 44 says, &ldquo;All those who believed were together,&rdquo; and verse 47 says, &ldquo;The Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.&rdquo; This means that the Lord added people to their gatherings, and it shows that they were an assembly. Verse 43 shows that when they gathered together, the authority of God was with them, and fear was upon every soul. Soon another five thousand men were added (4:4). If women were added to this number, surely there must have been ten thousand, all of whom were living a corporate life, a meeting life.</p>
<p>The needs of the multitude of believers resulted in two types of meetings. The first type involved joint meetings of all the believers. The temple was used as a gathering place for this kind of meeting, because the temple was a public area, spacious, and able to accommodate many people. The second type of gathering was from house to house. In these gatherings, the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, learning the truth, breaking bread, praying, and announcing the gospel from house to house (2:46; 5:42). Acts 20:20 also speaks of these two aspects in the work of the apostle: &ldquo;I did not withhold any of those things that are profitable by not declaring them to you and by not teaching you publicly and from house to house.&rdquo; When Paul was in Ephesus, he taught publicly, and he went from house to house teaching, persuading, instructing, and declaring to the believers all the counsel of God, not withholding any of the things which were profitable. According to the Bible, the meeting life of the early church involved large, joint gatherings and smaller gatherings from house to house. The gatherings in the homes are the small group gatherings that we are emphasizing today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOINT MEETINGS BEING<br />
IN THE NATURE OF SCHOOL EDUCATION</h2>
<p>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the gatherings of the church have two functions. Joint gatherings are in the nature of school education and home gatherings are in the nature of nourishing. In the joint gatherings we teach and speak the truth in the Word of God concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not a small matter. When Peter started to speak in Acts, the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was only beginning to be released, but by the completion of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles, the mystery of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was fully unveiled (Col. 1:25-26). The twenty-seven books of the New Testament contain the full revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which involves the Triune God passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and becoming the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into His believers. Through His process, the Triune God has released the divine life and can impart the divine life into us to become our life and nature. Individually we are sons of God, and corporately we are members of the Body of Christ, the house of God with a corporate meeting life.</p>
<p>Meetings are indispensable for the believers. When we stop meeting, the issue is spiritual death. Our experiences tell us that it does not take long to sense that something is wrong when we fail to gather with the saints. If we do not meet for six months, we will be quite dead in our spirit. Meeting with the saints is a crucial matter in the spiritual life of a Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning the Truth in the Twenty-seven Books<br />
of the New Testament</h2>
<p>In the meetings we must learn the truth. There are thirty-nine books in the Old Testament and twenty-seven books in the New Testament. We should learn the content of them all, especially the books in the New Testament. If we thoroughly learn these twenty-seven books, we will be clear concerning the truth revealed in the Old Testament. We should not think that we must first know the Old Testament in order to understand the New Testament; rather, the New Testament is the key that opens the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Every saved person should learn the truth in the New Testament. We should thoroughly understand the four Gospels, Acts, and Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. The Epistle of James contains warnings based on the failures of others. The Epistles of Peter, John, and Jude all render help. Revelation, the last book in terms of its position and its completion, is a &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; book to Christians all over the earth. Many pastors do not comprehend the mysteries it contains, and they keep it at a respectful distance. This is a great mistake. We must enter into the book of Revelation, because the New Testament is open to us, and God desires to show us His complete revelation.</p>
<p>When I was saved, I loved to read the Bible. However, I could not comprehend much of what I read, especially the Gospel of Matthew. Reading the genealogy in the first seventeen verses of chapter 1 made it difficult to continue to read the Gospel of Matthew. No matter how much I studied these verses, I could not understand them. At that time there were not many reference books to help me. Consequently, when I would begin to read the New Testament, I would start from Matthew 1:18. I read in this way for many years, but eventually I felt that this was not right. Often things that are difficult to understand logically are quite precious, whereas things that are easy to understand are not necessarily valuable. If everything was made of gold today, gold would not be very valuable. As I began to consider this, I realized that there must be a &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; in verses 1 through 17; consequently, I made a decision to consider them more carefully.</p>
<p>When I first started studying these verses, it was a labor, especially since it was difficult for me to find reference books in a small city in the northern part of China. From 1925 to 1936, I spent much time writing a pamphlet called <em>Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> I studied these seventeen verses thoroughly and explained them quite clearly. I believe that whoever examines that pamphlet will gain much help from it. [Note: Much of the content of this publication has been incorporated into the first seven messages in the <em>Life-study of Matthew.</em>]</p><h2 class="head2">Using the Recovery Version of the Bible<br />
and the Life-studies</h2>
<p>In 1974 I received a burden to write footnotes for all the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. I added footnotes to verses that, according to my own experience, were difficult to understand, difficult to expound, and profound in terms of the revelation of truth. At the same time, I felt that I should give messages to present the main points of each book as they related to the experience of the divine life. Since 1974 we have conducted bi-annual trainings in the United States to release messages on every book in the New Testament. These messages have spread throughout the earth. After eleven years and twenty-two trainings, in 1984 the translation of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament was completed and published with footnotes, outlines, and cross references. In addition, Life-study messages of each book have also been published.</p>
<p>Over the past one thousand years, many books related to the New Testament have been published, and we have spent much time studying the important books; nevertheless, many of the published books do not provide much help. We have gathered together the main points from the important books and, using simple words, included them in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. Hence, as long as a person reads the footnotes and the Life-study messages, all the riches we have received will be displayed before his eyes. It is easy to understand the New Testament with the footnotes and Life-study messages.</p>
<p>The whole set of the Life-study of the Bible has approximately one thousand two hundred messages, and each message is about ten pages long. Altogether, there are over twelve thousand pages, and it is quite profitable to read them. I hope that all the churches would utilize the Recovery Version of the Bible and the Life-studies to teach the truth to the saints. I often tell others that if I could have been introduced to the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-study of the New Testament sixty years ago, I would have spent much time to enter into them. If you are willing to spend eight hours a day for pursuing, you will be able to read the New Testament very thoroughly in two years. If you do not have eight hours, it is all right to spend four hours. The brothers and sisters who are consecrated as full-timers must spend fours hours a day to fully get into the Recovery Version and the Life-studies. In this way, after four years you will enter into the revelation of the New Testament. Then everyone will be able to teach others and speak with inspiration for God to others, that is, to prophesy. With so many prophets and teachers, the churches in all the localities will be in a glorious condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS BEING<br />
IN THE NATURE OF HOME NURTURING</h2>
<p>Small group gatherings are in the nature of home nurturing. The number of people who can gather in a home is usually not very large, and it is always sweet to get together. Therefore, we have a burden to establish the small group gatherings. We should learn from the Lord&rsquo;s way and have a maximum of twelve in a group. When there are more than twelve in a group, they should be divided into two groups. Since the number of people in a small group gathering is small, the nature of the meeting should be to nurture the saints. Rather than emphasizing the truth, the focus should be on nourishing, fellowshipping, shepherding, supporting, caring, and bearing one another. Both educational and nurturing meetings are necessary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ARRANGEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL<br />
AND NURTURING MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Joint Meetings for Education</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Supplying Life by Releasing the Truth</h2>
<p>The educational aspect of a joint meeting can be carried out with two kinds of meetings. The first kind supplies life by releasing the truth, and the second kind teaches the truth by expounding the Bible. The first aspect of education can be accomplished by nourishing the saints with a life message at least once a week. Such a message cannot be without foundation; it must be a living message, based on the pure word of truth, and be full of the light of life and the supply of life. All the saints will feel very satisfied after such a meeting. According to my experience over the past decades, the best time for such a meeting is from 10:00 to 11:30 A.M. every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Today in countries throughout the world, Sunday is a day of rest&mdash;schools have no classes, factories are closed, and many commercial businesses are not open. Thus, the brothers and sisters have time to listen to this kind of message. Therefore, we should have ample time for a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. If the starting time is too early, it will create difficulties for the saints. It also should not be too short so that there will be ample time for the release of the truth. Moreover, there should be time for the saints to share and give testimonies. All these matters should not be carried out in a hurried atmosphere so that every saint will receive help, light, and the life supply. These meetings cannot be conducted in a small group gathering; they should be held in the various meeting halls, and the messages should be released, in rotation, by brothers who can minister the word.</p><h2 class="head3">Teaching the Truth<br />
by Expounding the Scriptures</h2>
<p>The messages released on the Lord&rsquo;s Day mornings related to life and truth are for the purpose of supplying life; the primary emphasis is not on teaching the truth. Therefore, we still need a meeting for teaching the truth by expounding the Bible. The goal of this meeting is to help the saints understand the truth. Over the past few years, we have presented the truth using new terms, such as <em>the essential Spirit</em> and <em>the economical Spirit.</em> These new terms are used to better express the mysteries of the truth. Without these terms it would be impossible to express and to convey the truth. However, our apprehension of the truth depends upon our understanding of these new terms, but there is not much time on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning to teach these basic truths. In order for the saints to receive this kind of teaching in the truth, another time is needed. These truths need to be taught at least once a week.</p>
<p>There are altogether about one thousand two hundred messages in the Life-study of the New Testament; and although the quantity is quite large, we should not be afraid to teach the truth that they contain. As long as we have the heart to study the messages, progressing in a proper order, we will be able to finish them. We all know the story of the race between the tortoise and the hare. Although the hare was fast and the tortoise was slow, the hare lost the race because it did not run methodically. In contrast, the tortoise ran in a steadfast manner, step by step, and it eventually won. We do not have to teach the truth in a quick way. For example, it would be good to cover only fifty-two lessons in a year. However, since the truth in each topic is interrelated, fifty-two lessons will enable us to understand more than one hundred topics. This is not a heavy burden to bear. It is not even necessary to finish one message in a meeting. One thousand two hundred messages can become two thousand four hundred messages. Simply proceed one day at a time and learn the truth for that day, and before we even finish one thousand two hundred messages, our knowledge of the truth will increase greatly.</p>
<p>When our knowledge of the truth increases, so will our ability to speak these truths. If a person receives a university education, his speaking will be different from that of an uneducated person. The most productive citizens are those who have a proper education. This is also true of those who have a spiritual education. It would be good to have a meeting to teach the truth by expounding the Word once a week. After careful consideration before the Lord, we feel that it is more suitable for this meeting to be on Thursday night.</p>
<p>After the three thousand people were saved on the day of Pentecost, &ldquo;they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles&rdquo; (Acts 2:42). This means that the apostles were teaching the truth every day, and the saved ones were being taught and thereby lived in the teaching of the apostles. Before the day of Pentecost, the three thousand who were saved were living under the teaching of the Old Testament, but once they were saved, they turned from the teaching of the Old Testament to the teaching of the apostles. From that day onward, they &ldquo;continued steadfastly&rdquo; in the teaching of the apostles. Because we do not know God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, this is our need as well. We need two educational messages every week, one on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and another during the week. This will help us enter into the teaching of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Small Groups for Nourishing</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Bread-breaking Meeting</h2>
<p>The small group gatherings are related to the aspect of nurturing in the homes. Acts 2:42 speaks of &ldquo;the breaking of bread&rdquo; and &ldquo;prayers,&rdquo; and verse 46 says that the believers practiced &ldquo;breaking bread from house to house.&rdquo; This clearly shows that the bread-breaking meetings can be held in our homes. Thus, we would like to practice the breaking of bread in small groups in our homes.</p>
<p>This is something worth our study and consideration. If there are only seven or eight who meet regularly in a small group, it will not be very easy to have a spiritual atmosphere for the breaking of bread. Therefore, we should consider combining four or five small groups in the same neighborhood for the breaking of bread. A combined gathering would have about twenty to thirty people, and it would not be too difficult to hold the meeting in a saint&rsquo;s living room.</p>
<p>Based on our experience of many years, however, we also realize that the saints will lack an opportunity to meet other saints if we break bread in small groups throughout the year. After much consideration, we feel that we should have a joint meeting to break the bread in each of the district meeting halls on the first Lord&rsquo;s Day of every month. This will give the saints a chance to meet each other and to have an enlarged fellowship once a month. The breaking of bread can be on both a smaller scale in the small group gatherings and on a larger scale in the district halls. Furthermore, the atmosphere of a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting with twenty to thirty people cannot be compared to the rich and uplifted atmosphere of a larger meeting of the saints.</p>
<p>I began breaking bread in the local churches in 1932. In the past fifty-three years, I have been in several Lord&rsquo;s table meetings that were very uplifted and weighty. One Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in Chefoo was quite uplifted but not so weighty. Another Lord&rsquo;s table was in December 1984, in Irving, Texas, after a ten-day training. During this meeting, one thousand six hundred saints gathered together to break bread on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening. This meeting was truly unprecedented. Everyone who was there can testify that the meeting was wonderful and beyond description. The praises and prayers could hardly be described in words. Whoever attends such a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting will feel satisfied their entire life. Although it is not possible to have a large Lord&rsquo;s table meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day, we should have one at least once a month.</p>
<p>Presently, we do not have a large meeting hall. Hopefully, the church in Taipei will build a meeting hall that can hold ten thousand people and that has the best sound system. Then the whole church can gather at least once every three months to break bread together. For the breaking of bread, there is a need for large and also small gatherings. On the first Lord&rsquo;s Day of every month, the saints should come together in the district meeting halls to break the bread. On the other Lord&rsquo;s Days in the month, four or five small groups, depending on the number of people, should gather in their homes to break bread.</p><h2 class="head3">Prayer Meetings</h2>
<p>Regarding prayer meetings, the church cannot be without prayer. The prayer meetings should be held in small groups, just like the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings. They should be held in small groups throughout the year so that people will not have to go to the meeting halls. According to the Bible, every local church needs four kinds of meetings. First, the church needs a meeting to supply life by releasing the truth. Second, there is a need for a meeting to teach the truth by expounding the Scriptures. Third, we need to meet to break bread to remember the Lord and to worship the Father. Fourth, we need to meet to pray, telling God of our needs and praying to execute His will on the earth. These four meetings are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Small Group Gatherings<br />
and Preaching the Gospel in the Homes</h2>
<p>A small group should gather once a week in the homes, and we also need to preach the gospel in our homes. Strictly speaking, every brother and sister, whether strong or weak, progressing or backsliding, should preach the gospel in their home. We should keep the principle of preaching the gospel in our own homes and not ask others to preach for us. We all know that the best tasting rice is the rice that we have cooked for ourselves. Even if we do not know how to &ldquo;cook,&rdquo; it only takes a little practice. Therefore, we encourage the brothers and sisters to open their homes. Every household should preach the gospel. Sometimes the wife can preach the gospel, the husband can give a testimony, and the children can strengthen the words of their parents. Sometimes the children can preach the gospel, the mother can give a testimony, and the father can strengthen the words of the children and the mother. It is very meaningful when the whole family rises up and preaches the gospel. Some recently recovered saints, who used to be unwilling to meet, are taking the lead in this kind of family gospel meeting. In addition to the aforementioned meetings, we suggest having a small group gathering every other week and a family gospel meeting in the intervening weeks. In this way, we will have five kinds of meetings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are five kinds of meeting: a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning to supply life by releasing the truth, a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening for breaking bread, being held jointly in the districts halls on the first Lord&rsquo;s Day of every month and in small groups on the remaining Lord&rsquo;s Days of a month, a prayer meeting on Tuesday night, a meeting for teaching the truth on Thursday night, and then small group gatherings and family gospel meetings on one of the convenient remaining nights of the week.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A LONG-TERM VIEW,<br />
BEING ENLARGED IN CAPACITY,<br />
AND MAINTAINING A SUITABLE ATMOSPHERE<br />
FOR PEOPLE TO REMAIN</h2>
<p>Although these are meetings of the church, they may be a burden to saints who are newly saved or recently recovered. We should never force others to attend these meetings; instead, we should lead them slowly. We should not ask a brother who has been recently saved to attend too many meetings; instead, we should ask him to join a small group gathering. If he can attend a small group gathering every week, his inner man will be nourished, and he will gradually be strengthened. We also need to be aware of the capacity of a newly recovered brother. A person who has only recently recovered from an illness cannot eat too much at the beginning; he can only increase his intake of food gradually. However, once his condition improves, his appetite will return, and he will ask for more food. Likewise, after a dormant brother returns to a small group gathering, his spiritual appetite will slowly return, and he will spontaneously ask about the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. After attending these two meetings for a period of time, he will ask about meetings related to the release of the truth. Then we can bring him to the meetings where he can be supplied with life related to the truth of the economical Spirit and the essential Spirit and eventually to meetings that release the truth by expounding the Scriptures. In this way, we can gradually lead the saints into a fuller meeting life.</p>
<p>I hope that we would not create an atmosphere that causes people to feel that they are worldly unless they attend every meeting of the church. This kind of atmosphere will kill them. Seriously speaking, attending every meeting does not ensure that one is spiritual. In fact, for some, it might be better to meet less frequently. I know a sister who felt as if the Lord ignored her prayers for her husband&rsquo;s salvation. When I heard this, I told her that if she would go to less meetings for a few months, her husband would believe in the Lord, because her constant attendance made her husband afraid to believe in the Lord. When she slowed down, it was possible for her husband to catch up with her. If we treat the saints who do not attend every meeting as if they love the world more than the Lord, we will create a standard that can be attained only by angels. We should not have this kind of situation.</p>
<p>The church can be compared to a restaurant that prepares many different kinds of food. Even though many different dishes are available, no one expects every customer to eat them all. It is wonderful when a saint with a large capacity and supporting schedule can attend all the meetings, but we should not give others an impression that they are less spiritual if they do not attend all the meetings. This will discourage many and may even cause them to turn to the world because of their discouragement. These are words based on experience.</p>
<p>In the past twenty-eight years the church in Taipei baptized nearly fifty-eight thousand people, but not many remained because we did not make adjustments concerning our meetings. Those who did not remain often said, &ldquo;I have believed in Jesus and been baptized, but since I cannot go to so many meetings, I will not go to any meetings.&rdquo; We lost many in this way.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that these over fifty thousand people can be recovered. Many of them meet at least once a year and continue to give financial offerings. This shows that they have not forgotten the church. When they come to meetings, they should not be looked upon coldly or condemned for loving the world, and when they give an offering, they should not be criticized for not being in the meetings. No one can withstand such treatment. If we display this kind of attitude, we will drive many brothers and sisters away.</p>
<p>Among those who have been saved, some may not be so much for the Lord, some may have difficult situations, and some may have many human responsibilities, all of which restrict their ability to attend many meetings. We should sympathize with their situations. Even if some can attend only the first Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting of every year, we should love them and be thankful that they have not lost contact with the church. Our capacity must be enlarged. As long as we care for them continuously, they will progress gradually.</p>
<p>Since some saints come to a meeting only at the beginning or at the end of a year, we should make an announcement during these meetings and ask them to leave us their telephone number and address so that we can update our information cards. In the past, we ignored the information cards we received, but if we can determine which saints come once a month or even once a year, we can take care of them according to their situation and regain many of them.</p>
<p>It is good to attend the meetings, but we should realize that this is not possible for everyone. We all want to see an abundance of fruit, but this requires a long-term view. We need a long-term view in order for the church to uphold the saints. The fruit on a tree is often hidden among the many branches and leaves of a tree. Our &ldquo;tree&rdquo; may be full of leaves but have little visible fruit, but next year we may bear ten pieces of fruit. This is progress, and as long as the saints remain in some of the meetings of the church, they will have a chance to progress.</p>
<p>I hope that our capacity will be enlarged and that we will be open to everyone. If we are, the saints will keep coming. Some may come once a year, others may come twice a year, and still others may come three or four times a year or once every month. Because of this situation, the church needs five kinds of meetings. If someone can &ldquo;eat&rdquo; all five &ldquo;meals,&rdquo; this would be wonderful. However, it is still good if someone can eat only one meal or even just half a meal. This should be our attitude; I hope we all understand this.</p>
<p>Although some brothers and sisters do not meet, they are still preaching the gospel and telling others to believe in Jesus, as well as encouraging their relatives, friends, and children to come to the meetings. We should maintain an atmosphere of receiving all the brothers and sisters. We should not have any &ldquo;laws&rdquo; that kill people, and we cannot forsake our fifty thousand dormant brothers and sisters. We need a broad heart to go forth to restore the dormant ones and those who have lost contact with us. The Lord Jesus considers one lost sheep to be more precious than ninety-nine who are not lost (Luke 15:3-7). Therefore, we must treasure the dormant saints and those with whom we have lost contact. We must take care of them with the Lord&rsquo;s heart.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">SEEKING AND RESTORING<br />
THE DORMANT SAINTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 15:4-6, 8-9, 20-23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STIRRING UP AN ATMOSPHERE<br />
TO RESTORE THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>Although <em>Hymns,</em> #471 speaks of a saint returning to the Lord, we rarely sing this hymn because we have neglected the matter of restoring the dormant saints. I wrote this hymn at the start of the work in Taiwan because I felt a need to help the saints who were weak, backslidden, or cold. I used this hymn to stir up an atmosphere to help the weak ones and restore the backslidden ones. When we first arrived in Taiwan, we did not have an atmosphere of preaching the gospel, studying the truth, and pursuing the growth in life. We also did not have an atmosphere of taking care of people or serving the Lord. Hence, we felt that we needed to stir up such an atmosphere.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Stirring Up an Atmosphere<br />
in the Old Testament</h2>
<p>Today people in the world do things systematically, and the best systems are based on the Bible. The Bible comes from God, and its principles are known and used by many. For instance, the American founding fathers were influenced by the Puritans, who revered God. America is a strong and prosperous country because many of its governmental systems are based on principles found in the Bible. The concept of democracy practiced in America is rooted in principles spoken of in both the Old and New Testaments. In the Old Testament God commanded Moses to tell the Israelites not to rule over their brothers with severity so as to annul their rights (Lev. 25:46). In the New Testament the Gospel of Luke speaks of recovering human rights through the jubilee (4:18-19). After God&rsquo;s people entered the good land of Canaan, God allotted a portion of land to each tribe and to each family, each household (Num. 33:53-54). If a man sold his possession but did not have sufficient means to restore it himself, then in the year of jubilee, he could return to his possession. Thus, there was no possibility of an Israelite possessing large amounts of land in perpetuity (Lev. 25:8-17, 23-28).</p>
<p>When the jubilee arrived every fifty years, a trumpet was sounded (v. 9), and the land sold to another Israelite would no longer belong to him. The Bible does not say that the land was returned to the original owner; rather, it says that &ldquo;each of you shall return to his possession&rdquo; (v. 10). This is a recovering of human rights. A man may have sold his land and may have even fallen into the pitiful condition of selling himself into slavery, but according to God&rsquo;s ordination, he was no longer a slave as soon as the trumpet sounded and the jubilee arrived. Both he and his master instantly became equal before God, and the man who sold his land could return to his dwelling and possession. Therefore, every fifty years, land ownership among the Israelites was reallocated and balanced out. This is a marvelous matter. Today many excellent systems and principles in human communities are based on the Bible, and the highest ethical and moral standards and regulations are found in the Bible.</p>
<p>When God moves, He begins by stirring up an atmosphere. In the case of the jubilee this stirring up was accomplished by sounding the trumpet throughout the land. Even when the Israelites left Egypt and followed Moses, they moved according to the blowing of silver trumpets (Num. 10:2). In their journey with Moses, they never stayed in one place very long because a long encampment would cause them to be slothful. The Israelites moved by listening for the blowing of two silver trumpets. The sounding trumpets stirred up an atmosphere in preparation for the move of the children of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Stirring Up an Atmosphere in the New Testament</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament the blowing of trumpets stirred up an atmosphere. In the New Testament the atmosphere was first stirred up by John the Baptist (Matt. 3:1-3). Then the Lord Jesus (4:17), the twelve disciples (Mark 3:14-19), the seventy disciples (Luke 10:1), and the one hundred twenty disciples stirred up an atmosphere (Acts 1:15). Today an atmosphere of the gospel has been stirred up in the whole earth. In 1949, when I came to Taipei to start the work, I felt that the first thing we needed to do was to stir up an atmosphere of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STIRRING UP AN ATMOSPHERE<br />
IN THE INITIAL STAGE IN TAIPEI</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Distributing Tracts, Printing Posters,<br />
and Sending Out Teams</h2>
<p>In order to stir up an atmosphere of the gospel in Taipei in our initial stage, we determined the population of Taipei and then printed and distributed gospel tracts so that every resident in Taipei could receive one. In our practice we did not act on impulse, passing out tracts in a random way. Furthermore, we were not superstitious, thinking that with prayer alone the wind would blow and carry our tracts to every household. We asked the saints to come together and look at the map of the city of Taipei. Then we divided the city into small districts, studied the situation of every street, and decided which brothers and sisters should be responsible for the district. After receiving the tracts, the brothers and sisters placed them in mailboxes, going from house to house, covering the streets assigned to them so that every resident of the city would receive a gospel tract. This stirred up a gospel atmosphere.</p>
<p>Next we printed posters. We used four colors: red, yellow, blue, and green to prepare posters with words such as &ldquo;Believe in Jesus and be saved,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God loves the world.&rdquo; Then we placed these posters at train stations, bus stations, crossroads, important intersections, and on the front doors of the saints&rsquo; homes. In this way, people who were walking on the streets of Taipei could identify the homes of the saints. As the number of believers increased, the city of Taipei was filled with these posters.</p>
<p>We also sent out gospel teams. Gospel teams were first used in Shanghai, and we often had more than eight hundred on a team that would march through Shanghai. When the team reached the Bund, a major downtown district in Shanghai, we would shout with a loud voice, &ldquo;Oh, Shanghai! Repent quickly! If your sins do not go, peace cannot come.&rdquo; This stirred up a gospel atmosphere. When we started our work in Taipei, we strengthened the gospel teams, which were sent out in several ways. One team would go out on a regular basis in the evenings. With lanterns in their hands, the teams would go through the streets and small alleys shouting slogans, such as &ldquo;Repent!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Believe in the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another team would leave from hall one on the Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon, divide into four groups, and walk toward New Park. We would walk according to the beating of drums and sing, &ldquo;You need Jesus! You need Jesus! / Men and women all need Him! / For redemption you need Him, / For salvation you need Him! / And for everlasting life, / Yes, you need Jesus!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #1024). The four groups would take different routes and enter the park through its four gates. As we paraded through the streets, we gathered people into the park. People would stream in from all sides. New Park has over a thousand seats, and they were immediately filled. When everyone arrived, we would begin to sing hymns and preach a gospel message.</p>
<p>This was how we stirred up an atmosphere in those days. After gospel tracts were distributed and every street was saturated with gospel posters, people were easily attracted by the beating of the gospel drums on the streets. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day we would go to New Park to preach the gospel, and in the afternoon we would come back with four to five hundred names. We did this continuously for one to two years. During this time, quite a number were saved and some even became responsible brothers in different churches. We also had a meeting every Monday evening for saints who were burdened to visit the ones who had given us their names. We distributed these names to the saints, and they would go to visit them. This practice brought in an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and many people were deeply impressed with the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Stirring Up an Atmosphere to Pursue the Truth</h2>
<p>When we first started the work in Taiwan, we had only a few hundred brothers and sisters, but we very quickly increased to tens of thousands. This increase would not have been possible without stirring up an atmosphere of the gospel. At the same time, we also stirred up an atmosphere of pursuing the truth. Once a person is saved, he desires to know the truth. During this initial stage, we would share from <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures,</em> and eventually we began to release life-study messages. [Note: These messages are different from the messages that currently constitute <em>The Life-study of the Bible.</em>] I will never forget that a certain brother would travel a long distance by car just to come to hear these messages because an atmosphere of pursuing the growth in life, of consecration, and of loving the Lord had been stirred up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Stirring Up an Atmosphere<br />
to Seek Out Our Brothers and Sisters</h2>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #471 uses an 8.8.6.8.8.6. metrical form; that is, the words in each stanza are in two lines of eight syllables and one line of six syllables, which are repeated twice. The sound is very regular and rhythmic. I mention this hymn because I want to stir up an atmosphere of seeking out our brothers and sisters. Stanza 1 says, &ldquo;How can I ever stay away / And grieve Thy Spirit all the day / While Thou dost wait for me? / I now am willing to return, / And wait no longer, for I yearn / Henceforth to follow Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last line of the first stanza says, &ldquo;Henceforth to follow Thee.&rdquo; As we sing, our spirit will be stirred up. As we sing another verse, our spirit will go forth. As we continue singing, we will desire to seek out people, just as the Lord Jesus did, who after being incarnated in the flesh, was willing to go to the cross because of His deep desire to gain man. We have more than fifty thousand information cards with the names of our dear brothers and sisters in the Lord, but we do not know where many of them are currently living. These are our family members, but our care for them is so lacking that we do not even know where they are living. This is not proper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PRAYER FOR THOSE WHO<br />
HAVE NOT BEEN MEETING FOR A LONG TIME</h2>
<p>Lord, we are here before You. Stir up an atmosphere among us so that we would receive a burden to take Your heart as our heart and to take Your love as our love. We are here before Your throne; may You especially remember these fifty thousand brothers and sisters. We are touching Your throne of grace; we are praying for them and looking to You concerning them. O Lord, revive them and operate in them even as we are praying for them. May the indwelling Spirit cause them to have a renewed feeling; light the lamp within them, sweep them, and seek them. O Lord, hear our prayer. Cause us to truly receive a burden to bow our knees before You and pray for them. May each brother and sister receive ten, twenty, or thirty information cards, and seek out and visit these saints, one by one, until they find them and bring them back to the church.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesus! We pray that You would do this work not only in the hearts of a small number of saints but also in all who meet regularly so that everyone will have a sense of responsibility and a burden, realizing that we are members one of another. Many of the saints, who are wandering and lost, are still on this island. We call on You, Lord, for mercy and grace; manifest Your works; use the outward environment and the inward sense to touch these ones. Stir not only in us but also in them, just as You worked in Peter and in Cornelius so that there would be a response on both sides. Lord, recover these saints, one by one and household by household.</p>
<p>May You gain the glory, and may Your enemy be shamed. May blessing and grace be unto these brothers and sisters. Bless them, bless their family, bless their physical health, and bless their children. Bless them in every way. Bless this country, this society, and especially the city of Taipei. Lord, we thank You that You have caused this country to be prosperous, to be peaceful, and to have such a high standard of education so that we can all live and work in peace with joy. Thank You for a situation that is so suitable for the work of the gospel and for the building up of the church. Lord, bless the authorities over us; visit our senior officials, and give them wisdom. May their hearts be pure, and may they revere and fear You. Lord, bless every country, city, and town that reveres You. Thank You for listening to our prayer and accepting our prayer. Glory be to You. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>The first move of the church must be to recover the saints who have not been meeting and those with whom we have lost contact. According to our records, this is not a small matter. The church in Taipei has more than fifty thousand information cards. If we subtract the ones who meet regularly, the ones who have gone abroad, and the small number who have passed away, there are still at least forty-five thousand. Since the church in Taipei typically accounts for about half of the saints on Taiwan, there should be more than ninety thousand dormant saints on the whole island.</p>
<p>These saints are the harvest from our past labor and hard work. They were baptized, and they filled out information cards. They are our family members, but they have all disappeared; therefore, we must take this matter seriously. Now is the time to put the affairs of our household in order, and the first matter we should address is to find these saints in order to bring them back. If we would do this thoroughly by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we could recover two-thirds of them within two to three years. It would not be surprising to recover three to five thousand during the first half of this year, but recovering the majority will require a long-term effort by the saints who regularly meet in small groups. This is something that requires labor, but at least two-thirds will be recovered if we do it well. If thirty thousand saints are recovered, this will greatly strengthen the testimony and service of the church in Taipei.</p><h2 class="head2">Thoroughly Examining the Information Cards</h2>
<p>In order to recover these brothers and sisters, our initial plan is to thoroughly examine the existing information cards. Among the fifty thousand names in the church in Taipei, about ten thousand of the addresses are accurate. Of this number, there are approximately five to six thousand saints who participate in the church life regularly and about six thousand more who come to an occasional meeting. Thus, we have accurate address information for these saints. The information regarding these six thousand saints who occasionally meet has been distributed to each small group; this is a very good situation. We need to begin by recovering the brothers and sisters who seldom attend meetings but whose whereabouts are known. This involves a work of visitation and restoration.</p>
<p>We also need to locate the nearly forty thousand saints whose whereabouts are unknown. This is very time consuming, and we are in the process of looking for a way that the churches in Taiwan can coordinate with each other in order to find these saints. We have begun by distributing these information cards to each small group so that they can at least go to the addresses that are listed on the cards. This is a way for us to begin to restore these saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving the Burden to Go Out and Visit</h2>
<p>The key to recovering these saints is for the brothers and sisters who regularly meet in the small groups to receive a burden. Without a burden, it will be difficult to move; with a burden, there will be grace. We need a burden to visit eight or nine, not just one or two. On average, each saint needs to be willing to contact at least eight. This is a great and difficult task. Nevertheless, I want to encourage you with one statistic: when the number of saints attending the meetings increases to forty thousand, approximately one out of every thirty people in Taipei will be one of our brothers and sisters. This will make it quite easy for us to penetrate every social level with the gospel. We will have brothers and sisters in every trade and profession, whether accountants, business owners, army generals, university professors, homemakers, or taxi drivers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Testimony<br />
and Praying Desperately</h2>
<p>Our testimony needs to be strengthened. The saints who are wandering outside are scattered and not enjoying the riches of our family. They are truly like the prodigal son who could not find even carob pods to eat (Luke 15:13-16). But in the Father&rsquo;s house, in God&rsquo;s house, which is the church, the food is plentiful. Therefore, we must be compassionate toward them and bring them home to enjoy the riches in the Father&rsquo;s house with us.</p>
<p>Before going out, we need to pray thoroughly. I can absolutely testify to the effectiveness of prayer. In 1932, when the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, I could see the effectiveness of our prayer every day. The Lord would bring people in ways that were quite wonderful. We have to believe that our concern matches the Lord&rsquo;s concern on the throne; in fact, His concern has touched us to be concerned for others. Thus, we must receive a burden to pray. In the beginning we may not know the names of the ones who need to be restored. We may only know that there are forty to fifty thousand who need our prayer. We can tell the Lord, &ldquo;Remember these saints.&rdquo; I believe that if two to three thousand pray daily, the Lord will hear our prayer.</p>
<p>Along with prayer, we will distribute the information cards according to geographic regions, and we will encourage the saints to fellowship in the small groups. For instance, we can say to one another, &ldquo;This sister has not been to a meeting for a while. Do we know a sister who is close to her and who could go and visit her?&rdquo; If no one knows her, we could ask, &ldquo;Is there anyone who is willing to receive a burden to go to her?&rdquo; Since each card contains details related to age, family situation, parents, and children, we will be able to fellowship about a saint&rsquo;s particular condition. With such fellowship, some will receive a burden to go and visit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF VISITING</h2>
<p>Visiting dormant saints needs much consideration. If we do not do it properly, we will drive them further away. If our visiting will only drive them further away, it would be better not to visit them. When saints ask me what they should do when they visit, it is difficult to give a specific answer because I have found that my ways do not always work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Praying and Learning Spirit</h2>
<p>Consider the example of boxing. A teacher may teach boxing in the classroom in one way, but when it comes to the actual boxing match, the teacher&rsquo;s instructions may not work. In a boxing match, one has to make adjustments according to the actual situation. Consequently, the most important matter in visiting is to have a praying and learning spirit, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, only You can restore this one.&rdquo; None of us can do this in ourselves. Those with no experience will certainly face difficulties, but even those with experience cannot rely on what they have learned in the past, because every person&rsquo;s situation is different. We must look to the Lord, praying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me. I can do nothing. Give me the wisdom and the words I need to speak.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Inappropriate Speaking</h2>
<p>When we visit the dormant saints, we must avoid inappropriate speaking. For example, we should not say, &ldquo;We are visiting you because you have not been to a meeting for a while.&rdquo; Since the one we are visiting will have some sense of shame related to not being in the meetings, there is no need to remind him of this fact. There is no need to expose weaknesses or faults. We must look upon these saints as being without any blemish (Eph. 5:27). To speak of such matters is inappropriate.</p>
<p>We also must avoid using words that give them a sense of being pressured. We must not urge them to come back to the meeting or chastise them for not being in the meetings, saying, &ldquo;It is not good to miss the meetings. If you do not meet, you will miss out on the blessing in the church.&rdquo; Such words are inappropriate and should be avoided. We should not expose people&rsquo;s weaknesses or tell them that they must come to the meetings. Even when we give a testimony of how we have been blessed, we can inadvertently imply that they are not blessed, and if we speak of how we have been richly supplied by attending all the meetings, they may only be reminded that they have not attended any meetings recently. This kind of speaking should be avoided altogether. A testimony should not be a pretext to preach, to beat, or even to chastise the dormant saints for not loving the Lord. Someone who has not been in a meeting for a long time is very sensitive; he may have many feelings that cause him to be suspicious and overly sensitive; thus, it is easy for him to misinterpret our words. Visiting people is not easy, and we must pay attention to a person&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>When we visit a dormant brother or sister, we must not speak carelessly. Visiting such ones is like skating on thin ice. If we are a little careless, we may fall through the ice and damage them as well. Therefore, we must not speak in a light way. We need a joyful face, and we should give them no reason to feel any pressure or anxiety. Even saying, &ldquo;I am really concerned for you,&rdquo; will only make some secretly wonder whether our concern is only based on their weakness. Careless words will cause psychological reactions, and they must be avoided.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Joyful Face</h2>
<p>In principle when we visit people, we must have a smiling face, a face without sorrow or sadness. At the same time, we need to let people speak. We do not need to say so much; rather, we should join in with what they are speaking, following their topic in sincerity. Yet even in this, we need wisdom. For instance, a brother may say, &ldquo;I am really ashamed that I have not gone to a meeting for a long time.&rdquo; It would not be good to follow by saying, &ldquo;Yes, it is wrong not to meet!&rdquo; It also may not be good to even say, &ldquo;God still loves you,&rdquo; because this may open a hidden wound. We need much learning and consideration concerning these matters. When we visit the saints, eight out of ten will indicate that they are ashamed about not meeting. A better way to follow may be to speak of our own experience, saying, &ldquo;Even when I missed meetings in the past, the saints were always happy to see me when I came.&rdquo; Or if we have had contact with him in the past, we could say, &ldquo;That does not matter, I really missed you.&rdquo; We need much practice because a person who has not met for a while is very sensitive. This is a very crucial matter.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that we should pray with a brother or sister who has not been meeting for a while, but we should not be too quick in this regard. In the matter of visiting, we must hold firm to one principle: We should be careful about the things we speak. More than speaking, we just need to smile because of our joy in seeing them. This will spontaneously draw them close to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>I was born in Christianity, and I went to Christian schools, but by the time I was sixteen, I began to despise Christianity. It seemed as if the Bible did not teach anything better than Confucius&rsquo; teachings, so I did not see why we needed Western teachings. The reputation of some pastors and evangelists also was not very good. Hence, by the time I reached the age of sixteen, I felt that Christianity was not very meaningful, so I stopped attending Sunday services. Even though my mother was not saved, she was zealous for Christianity, but she could not make me go to the Sunday services. During this period of time, the Lord&rsquo;s mercy was surely very marvelous. My second sister, due to the sudden passing away of her fianc&#233;, was willing to consecrate herself to study in a distinguished seminary in Nanking. Before leaving home, she entrusted me to the care of a Chinese pastor named Yu.</p><h2 class="head2">Pastor Yu&rsquo;s Visits</h2>
<p>Pastor Yu was truly saved, and even though he was not so clear about the truth, he was a very proper person. When he came to visit me, he often would say nothing more than, &ldquo;I am here to see you.&rdquo; Sometimes, he would gently convey an invitation to attend the Sunday morning service. His words were not so direct, but I did not respond. He would come again a week later with the same approach; he would not speak much, but he would have a smiling face. Even though I knew that he wanted me to go to the Sunday service, I would not go. One day he came and just said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, the New Year is coming. I am afraid that I will not be able to come and see you for the next few weeks. After the New Year, I will come again to visit you.&rdquo; I truly believe that Pastor Yu was praying for me during this time, and no doubt, my sister was desperately praying for me because she knew my condition. At that time, I was not saved, I was not attracted to the Lord, and I did not agree with Christianity. This is why my sister had such a burden for me and asked Pastor Yu to visit me.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>In 1925 I was nineteen years old and full of vitality. On the second day of the Chinese New Year, which was a Lord&rsquo;s Day, I should have gone out to have a good time, like the worldly people. However, something wonderful happened that day. When I woke up that morning, I had no interest in pursuing pleasure; in fact, I had no motivation to do anything. My mother earnestly hoped that I would attend the Sunday service, so that morning she prepared a delicious breakfast. After I was finished, she casually asked, &ldquo;Today is the second day of the New Year; do you plan to go anywhere?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I was thinking about going to Pastor Yu&rsquo;s Sunday service.&rdquo; My mother, of course, readily agreed with me, so I put on my Chinese long gown and went to the service. I had not been to a service for years, and the only reason I was willing to return was because of Pastor Yu&rsquo;s visits.</p>
<p>When we go to visit the saints, it is often better not to speak than to speak, and if we have to speak, we should not speak too much. All we need is a smiling countenance and a short visit of about half an hour. The Holy Spirit can do the rest. After we visit, we should not go back too soon. It is not unreasonable to wait for two weeks because another visit after a short period of time is like a doctor giving too much medicine to a sick patient. We do not need to be quick or rushed; rather, we should trust in the work of the Holy Spirit. We must believe that the Holy Spirit will work in this kind of visitation.</p>
<p>That year, on the second day of the New Year, I attended the service at Pastor Yu&rsquo;s denomination. Although the sermon was not outstanding and I did not really understand it, I felt that it would be good to go every week. Therefore, I made a resolution: &ldquo;From now on I will not go and play. I will work hard on my studies to receive a good education, and every Lord&rsquo;s Day I will go to this chapel to sit for an hour and a half.&rdquo; From then on I went to Sunday service every week. Three or four months later, Pastor Yu announced, &ldquo;Every season we have a baptism here. Whoever is willing may come next Saturday for an interview. If we feel that you are ready, we will baptize you the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Saturday came, I went. Pastor Yu was very familiar with me, and he introduced me to everyone, saying, &ldquo;There is no problem with Mr. Lee. His sister is studying in the seminary, his mother is a church member, and their household has been zealous for several generations, so he can be baptized.&rdquo; Thus, I passed the interview. Actually, I did not understand anything at the time. I knew a little about the Lord Jesus dying on the cross for me and that He loved me, but I did not know much beyond this. Since they were all so happy, I received the baptism by sprinkling and was admitted to the denomination that Lord&rsquo;s Day. I surely did not have much feeling, and I had never prayed once; I merely did what the denomination told me to do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Calling<br />
and Consecrating Myself</h2>
<p>Two or three weeks after my baptism, an announcement was made about a young sister named Peace Wang, who was raised in China and was very powerful in preaching the gospel in Shanghai and Hangchow. All the local denominations jointly invited her to Chefoo, and although I did not care about the gospel, I was curious and wanted to hear this young sister preach. When I went into the meeting, I heard her speak about Satan usurping man based on Exodus 1, which speaks of Pharaoh usurping the children of Israel and not letting them serve God. Although she was only five or six years older than I, I was shocked by her speaking and singing in the meeting. I was born in Christianity, and I had heard many preachers, but her preaching was different from what I had heard in the past. There were about one thousand in the meeting, and as soon as the singing of the hymns began, many were subdued. I was no exception. I was affected deeply. At that time I had just made up my mind to concentrate on the pursuit of my studies in order to be successful in this world. I was anxious, restless, and intent on gaining the world. The words in Sister Peace Wang&rsquo;s message spoke directly to my current situation, and I was truly captured.</p>
<p>I will never forget that day. After the meeting was over, while I was on my way home, I stopped at a corner and looked up to heaven and said, &ldquo;O God, I believe in You, and I want You. If someone would give me the whole world, I would not want it. I only want You.&rdquo; I was determined to take my Bible and preach the gospel from village to village after I graduated from college. I did not want to do anything but preach the gospel; this was my prayer to the Lord when I was called. Little did I know that the Lord would bring me not only from village to village but also from continent to continent. Surely this is His leading.</p>
<p>Speaking about my salvation and calling by the Lord almost brings tears to my eyes. I will always remember Pastor Yu and be grateful to him. Later the Lord raised up a church in my hometown, and I preached the truth there. Around 1932 or 1933, Pastor Yu came to attend our meeting. He was so happy to see that a young man whom he had visited was preaching the truth. His visits were truly effective.</p>
<p>As long as we visit people, this is good enough. Many times, our words are not appropriate, and because we do not know their inner condition, it is easy to hurt them and cause them to feel bad. However, if we go with a cheerful countenance, they will be comforted and touched. They will feel that neither the Lord nor the church has forgotten them. This will give the Holy Spirit a great opportunity to work in them.</p>
<p>May we all grasp this principle. In the matter of visiting, we must first have a burden to pray and then visit according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. It is good as long as we go. Our going is enough. This will bring comfort and encouragement to the saints, and they will sense both love and joy. We should not expect quick results in visiting. Looking for quick results often leads to the opposite effect and brings in much frustration. There is no need to exert too much energy; we only need to go and visit with a burden. I surely learned a great lesson related to this from Pastor Yu&rsquo;s visits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LORD&rsquo;S HEART AS OUR HEART</h2>
<p>We must take the Lord&rsquo;s heart as our heart and treasure the lost sheep (Luke 15:4-6), loving the brothers and sisters who have not been to a meeting for a long time and paying the price to find them. Although there is a price to pay in visiting people, requiring not only the expense of time and energy but even a considerable amount of thought, the price the Lord paid was much higher. We must have a spirit to lay these dormant saints on our shoulders like lambs and bring them back to the church. We must take outward actions and bear an inward burden. In this way, sooner or later they will be brought back to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELYING ON THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>As we seek out the saints, we must rely on the work of the Holy Spirit. I truly believe that my return to the meetings was altogether the work of the Holy Spirit; it was the Holy Spirit who brought me back. The work of the Spirit is likened in Luke 15 to a woman who lights a lamp to seek a lost coin. The Holy Spirit is able to shine upon the saints with the Lord&rsquo;s word and is willing to search for them until they are found (vv. 8-9)</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVING PEOPLE WITH THE FATHER&rsquo;S LOVE</h2>
<p>We must love others with the Father&rsquo;s love. We all know the story of the father who eagerly welcomed his prodigal son in chapter 15 of the Gospel of Luke. When the son came to himself and thought about returning home, he considered the words of repentance that he would speak to his father (v. 18). On the day he returned home to his father, he said, &ldquo;I am no longer worthy to be called your son&rdquo; (v. 21), but the father said to his slaves, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again&rdquo; (vv. 22-24). This shows that the father had only love toward his son.</p>
<p>We must take the Lord&rsquo;s heart as our heart. As our brothers and sisters return, our hearts must be filled with love for them, and we must minister Christ to them. The father spoke only of slaying the fattened calf in celebration of his son&rsquo;s return; he did not mention things from the past or touch his son&rsquo;s wounds. He forgot the past. Even if the dormant saints want to bring up their past, we must let them know that it is not necessary, because of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. We should only minister Christ to them. The robe in Luke 15 is Christ, and the fattened calf is also Christ. Thus, as our brothers and sisters return, we can minister what we have experienced and enjoyed of Christ according to the need. In this way, we will gradually recover them. I hope that we will receive this burden and actively stir up the small groups to seek out, visit, and restore the saints who have been absent from the meetings for a long time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
IN EVERY HOME</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVERS IN THE LORD HAVING<br />
A GOSPEL-PREACHING LIFE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;From house to house...announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ&rdquo; means that the gospel can be preached in every home and that the gospel should be preached in every home (Acts 5:42). When we see the expression <em>announcing the gospel,</em> our inner being leaps because, as believers, we have a gospel-preaching life in us. This life can never be fully quenched. As long as we believe into the Lord and have the Lord&rsquo;s life, there will always be a response in our inner being when the gospel is mentioned no matter what our condition is. When we pray and sing hymns related to the gospel, we also have a feeling that the gospel is glorious. The more we preach the gospel, the stronger our inner being becomes and the more feeling we have for the gospel.</p>
<p>The increase and spread of the church is carried out through the preaching of the gospel. Without the preaching of the gospel, it is difficult for the church to increase and spread. The book of Acts concerns the spread of the church, and it contains numerous records of preaching the gospel. The church was able to spread because there were many groups of disciples who were witnesses of the Lord. They were not pastors or preachers but the Lord&rsquo;s living witnesses. In every place their primary work was to preach the gospel. They preached the gospel in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth (1:8). The book of Acts is a record of the saints&rsquo; preaching of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD<br />
OF THE CHURCH&mdash;THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>The way for the increase and spread of the church has been laid out clearly before us. The basis and means for this increase and spread is through the building up of small groups. The preaching of the gospel cannot be carried out by a spiritual &ldquo;giant&rdquo; or by a few great spiritual men; rather, it must be carried out through groups of disciples, who gather in the cities where they live and who announce the gospel from house to house. Going from house to house is simply the gatherings of the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The &ldquo;Defensive&rdquo; Function of Small Groups&mdash;<br />
Upholding and Restoring the Saints</h2>
<p>The first function of a group gathering is to sustain the brothers and sisters who meet regularly. Although many saints meet regularly, the big meetings cannot uphold their spiritual life. Through the building up of small groups, the saints have more opportunities to fellowship and pray with one another. This makes it easy to sustain their spiritual life.</p>
<p>A small group should also function to restore brothers and sisters who have not met for a long time. In the days to come, many testimonies will confirm this burden as we practice the group meetings. The small group gatherings fill up a lack in the ability of big meetings to restore those who have been absent from the meetings for a long time.</p>
<p>Those who have been absent from the meetings often feel ashamed to come to a big meeting, and they do not know how to function in such a meeting. However, the fellowship in a small group gathering warms and comforts them as if they were at home. Through this warm feeling, they can gradually be restored. The small groups are not an army or a school but a family. In a family there is warmth as well as love. With love and warmth we can restore our dear brothers and sisters one by one. This is the &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; function of the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The &ldquo;Offensive&rdquo; Function of Small Groups&mdash;<br />
Every Home Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>Although the small groups can uphold existing saints and restore dormant saints, the increase and spread of the church will not proceed in a full way if we focus only on this &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; function. We also must focus on the &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; function of preaching the gospel from house to house. Through the supply of life and the teaching of the truth, we can uphold and restore the brothers and sisters. Yet when we look around, we still see many relatives, friends, and neighbors who are unbelievers, and we surely have some feeling for them. The city of Taipei is like a big fishpond. In this fishpond there are many who need the gospel. These &ldquo;fish&rdquo; should be the target of our work. We should not only uphold our existing brothers and sisters and restore our lost brothers and sisters; we should also go on the offensive to reach our gospel friends, that is, those who have not yet believed in the Lord, so that they may know the gospel and receive the blessings of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">The More We Preach, the More We Have<br />
the Moving Power and the Word</h2>
<p>A brother or sister may say, &ldquo;My meeting life is only now becoming normal. I have been greatly blessed by joining a small group gathering, but I am not sure if I am ready to preach the gospel.&rdquo; According to experience, however, we must realize that a normal spiritual life is always advancing. The more we try to merely maintain what we have, the more we will lose it; the more we try to keep it, the more it will leak away. When we go out by faith to speak for the Lord, He will be with us, and our spirit will rise up. The more we go out, the more active our inner man will become, and the more we go out, the more we will have the Lord&rsquo;s word. I believe many of us have had this experience. For example, when we saw saints put on gospel vests, we were scared and even a little embarrassed, but when we put on a gospel vest ourselves, the Spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s word emboldened us. This shows that when we go out, the Spirit of the Lord will be with us. The small groups not only join brothers and sisters together through mutual love, care, and concern; they also provide the saints the way to move. Preaching the gospel keeps us in a normal spiritual condition, full of the moving power of life.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts the economical Spirit is for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. If we want to experience the economical Spirit, we must be in God&rsquo;s move. If we are not in this move, we have no ground to claim the outpoured Spirit. We all desire to experience the Lord, to have a life that is full of power, and to be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. We can achieve this by entering into the Lord&rsquo;s move to carry out His economy. When we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s gospel move, the economical Spirit of the Lord will be upon us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">New Faces Being the Life Pulse<br />
of Small Groups</h2>
<p>In order to be blessed by the Lord, a small group must be fully related to the gospel. Whenever a small group loses its gospel nature, it will come to a standstill. Whenever there are gospel friends in a small group gathering, the gathering is full of freshness. Without gospel friends, the gathering gradually goes downhill. Every new face, regardless of whether it is weak or even opposing, fills the brothers and sisters with a fresh burden. Before a new one comes, the direction of the meeting may be uncertain, but once he arrives, the direction and utterance become clear. New faces are the life pulse of a small group. As long as there are new ones, there will be burden, feeling, and utterance. Hence, the small groups truly need the offensive function of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Every Brother and Sister<br />
Being a Witness of the Lord</h2>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord said that the disciples would receive power to be His witnesses. This shows that every believer should be a witness of the Lord. We should not have the concept that only preachers and missionaries can be witnesses of the Lord; we all are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. In the church there are gifts and offices. With regard to the gifts, there are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. With regard to offices, there are elders and deacons. A brother may think that he cannot do anything if he is not an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd-teacher, elder, or deacon. However, he surely can be the Lord&rsquo;s witness. As long as we have the Lord&rsquo;s life, we are witnesses. A witness does not need eloquence or even any gift.</p>
<p>When we hear about preaching the gospel, we often make many excuses, such as saying that we are not eloquent or gifted. We must cast aside all our excuses for not preaching the gospel. We need to strengthen our spirit of gospel preaching as well as the atmosphere of gospel preaching. We need to raise the value of gospel preaching. Some may think that they are not eloquent, but eloquence is not needed. Even the apostle Paul did not have regard for the &ldquo;excellence of speech or of wisdom&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:1). There is even no absolute measure of eloquence. Even though some may speak more and others speak less, no one can exhaustively speak of the Lord&rsquo;s grace or fully speak of the mystery of Christ. When we speak of spiritual things, eloquence does not matter, because we all can speak. As long as we open our mouths, we will be able to speak of the things that we have seen.</p>
<p>A witness is one who sees and then testifies. To different degrees, we all have seen the Lord and His grace and mercy. If we have not seen anything, we would not be in the church; if we have not seen anything, we would not come to the church meetings. Since we have seen the Lord, we can be His witnesses. We can testify of the Lord by speaking one sentence or one message; in the eyes of the Lord there is no difference. Whether we speak well or speak poorly, we can still testify. In fact, unbelievers do not pay much attention to how we speak; they want to hear our testimony. When gospel friends come to us, they may not have a strong impression of a gospel message, but they will never forget the testimonies they hear because these testimonies are full of subjective experience.</p>
<p>In this regard, every brother and sister can give a testimony. Although our testimony may not have a spectacular aspect to it, such as the salvation experience of a notorious criminal or of a person with a long and serious illness, it is still a genuine experience that we can speak of to our gospel friends. We should never underrate our experience; it may be a treasure to an unbeliever. For example, we can testify of our lack of inward peace, which caused us to lose much sleep at night and how we found both peace and human rest by believing in the Lord. Even though we think that this is a small matter, it may be the warmest testimony to our gospel friends. Hence, we all can be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p><h2 class="head3">Starting from Those around Us</h2>
<p>Acts 1:8 tells us that our witnessing should be &ldquo;in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Today our &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; is our relatives, friends, and neighbors. Our gospel does not start in Africa or Mongolia. Rather, it starts with our relatives, friends, and neighbors. When it comes to preaching the gospel, many of us are willing to go to far-away places, but we are unwilling to go to nearby places. However, the Lord&rsquo;s charge does not speak of going from the uttermost part of the earth to Jerusalem but from Jerusalem to the uttermost part of the earth. Therefore, we should start with our relatives, friends, and neighbors, preaching and working on them one by one. Thus, we should preach throughout all of Taipei and then to the towns and villages in Taiwan. Then we can preach to places that are in the uttermost parts of the earth. This is the Lord&rsquo;s sequence; this is also the Lord&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>Today we should consider those who are around us. We should pray for them, bring them before the Lord, and faithfully testify to them concerning the Lord Jesus. Within a short period of time, the gospel will spread out like ripples from a stone thrown into water. This is the Lord&rsquo;s charge to us, and this is the Lord&rsquo;s promise to us. When we go out, the economical Spirit of the Lord will be upon us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN EVERY HOME<br />
BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Whenever we talked about preaching the gospel in the past, we thought of putting on gospel vests, handing out gospel tracts, and holding a gospel meeting. In the meeting some brothers would lead the singing of hymns and give a message. At the end, there would be a &ldquo;drawing in of the nets&rdquo; and a collection of names. There is a degree of effectiveness in this kind of gospel preaching, but our recent practice and leading has shown us that this may not be the most effective way. The most effective way is to preach the gospel in every home every other week. If everyone preaches in this way, we will realize that everyone truly can preach the gospel. Our preaching of the gospel should be continual. The most effective way to preach the gospel is in every home continually. This kind of gospel preaching will not result in something great in an outward way, but with every member speaking in a continual way throughout the year, there will be an effective move of the Lord in the gospel.</p>
<p>We truly worship the Lord that He has unveiled this way to us and has enabled us to see this effective way. I hope that through such a fellowship, we would rise up and no longer speak of not being eloquent or of not having the gift to preach the gospel. If someone is too &ldquo;gifted,&rdquo; he can actually hinder the preaching of the gospel in the homes. For example, if someone is so strong that he sounds like thunder and lightning, it may be difficult for people to receive the gospel. The gospel can be preached in this way in a big meeting, but intense speaking in a small group often scares people off.</p>
<p>In one small group gathering in the past, a brother preached the gospel for over an hour, and then he even wanted to &ldquo;draw in the net&rdquo; in a formal way. There were only about ten brothers and sisters in the small group and two gospel friends, so his attempt to &ldquo;draw in the net&rdquo; was awkward. With a sense of desperation, the brother even asked the two gospel friends to kneel down to pray in front of everyone. The gospel friends knelt down but only out of a sense of courtesy. After this experience, they were unwilling to come to another small group gathering. When we preach the gospel in the small groups, we do not need to be too aggressive or pushy. Otherwise, it will be very easy to make our gospel friends uncomfortable. We truly need the economical Spirit in order to preach the gospel, but the power of the economical Spirit may not always manifest itself as a roaring lion; it can also manifest itself as a gentle lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging Every Brother and Sister<br />
to Open Their Homes<br />
for the Preaching of the Gospel</h2>
<p>We should encourage the brothers and sisters in the small groups to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel. This is a very crucial point. Preaching the gospel by opening our homes is different from preaching the gospel in the meeting halls because there is no place for show or fa&#231;ade; it only requires everyone to exercise his or her spirit. Preaching in this way attracts people, and it warms and comforts them. We should encourage all the saints in the small groups to open their homes to preach the gospel. Even a weak saint has something precious to offer. Many so-called weak brothers and sisters become strong when they preach the gospel. Brothers and sisters who do not speak much in a big meeting all speak in a small group gathering. When they go to a church meeting and see older saints who have been following the Lord a long time, they often do not speak. However, in a small group gathering when they see that their gospel friends are unclear about the gospel and do not know the Lord Jesus, they become bold and are burdened to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We should encourage every brother and sister in the small group gatherings to open their homes for gospel preaching, whether they are strong or weak. Sometimes the so-called weak brothers and sisters actually have more gospel friends than we do, because those who have been in the church for a long time may have fewer friends in the world. If these so-called weak brothers and sisters opened their homes to preach the gospel, they could easily invite ten or twenty relatives, friends, and neighbors to come. This is the best way to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Preach the Gospel<br />
in Their Homes</h2>
<p>We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel by themselves in their own homes. This requires constant encouragement. The members of the small groups should pick up a burden to encourage each other to preach the gospel by themselves in their homes. Although this preaching may not be flawless, it will have a much better flavor. When we eat at a good restaurant, we may eat the best delicacies, but we do not have much of an intimate and warm feeling. When we eat at home, however, we eat more ordinary food, but we feel quite intimate and warm. When we preach the gospel ourselves, the taste will be unique and enjoyable. In some groups there are brothers and sisters who are not very strong and who do not often come to other meetings. But when it is time to preach the gospel in their home, they will start seeking and preparing. Perhaps the husband will suggest that the family read John 3:16 about how God loves the world. As the time approaches, he may lack confidence in his ability to speak so he may ask his wife to listen to what he is going to speak. After speaking in this way, he may realize that his words need to be supported with some verses, so he will look up some related references. Those who preach the gospel in their homes will not only bring unbelievers to salvation but will also be blessed themselves. Preaching the gospel will not be a heavy burden but an enjoyment. The more we preach, the more we will enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Preaching the Gospel Every Other Week</h2>
<p>We should practice preaching the gospel in our homes every other week. This is only a suggestion. We can fellowship with the saints in our group about the details concerning the gospel preaching times in the homes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Freely Hearing the Gospel</h2>
<p>Since we can continually preach the gospel in our homes, we will have many opportunities to invite our relatives, friends, and neighbors to come and freely hear the gospel. We need to pay attention to the word <em>freely.</em> In the past we have not been so wise. Throughout the year we may not have spoken much to our relatives, friends, and neighbors, but when the New Year&rsquo;s gospel meeting approached, we tried to invite people, often compelling them to come and hear the gospel. This is not the proper way. The best way is to converse with our relatives and neighbors in our daily life and to establish a basis for friendship by contacting and getting to know them in a normal way. We may, for example, invite them for tea and say nothing to them about the gospel. Then at some time in the future, we can let them know that we are having a meeting in our home to read the Bible with some friends and to speak concerning the Lord Jesus and that they are welcome to come. If we have a relationship with them, it will be much easier to invite them.</p>
<p>Leading people to salvation does not involve things that are miraculous or strange. Rather, it is according to the law of fruit-bearing. As long as we labor according to this law, it will be very easy to bring people to the Lord. Since our gospel contacts are also our relatives, friends, and neighbors, we can invite them to come to more than just one meeting. When we contacted people in the past, we would speak of the meeting and say, &ldquo;Please come to the meeting.&rdquo; This often made people feel awkward, and it was hard for them to accept our invitation. We need to be in touch with people frequently so that it will be easy for them to accept our invitation when we invite them, and if they cannot come, there will always be another meeting. When we contact people, we should invite them to come freely to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>We also should not give them a strict time to arrive. Some may come a little late, and we should let them. Some may need to leave a little early, and we should not compel them to stay to the end. We should let them freely come and freely leave. Nevertheless, they will always receive something when they come. This is the difference between preaching in our homes and preaching in a large gospel meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">First Giving a Personal Testimony,<br />
Then Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The best way to preach the gospel in our homes is to first give a personal testimony concerning our salvation and then speak a short word about the gospel. Small group gatherings do not need a renowned preacher or a lengthy sermon. There are no preachers in a small group gathering because there is no need for a preacher; rather, everyone can testify. For example, after inviting two gospel friends to our home, there can be brief introductions. Perhaps the husband may say, &ldquo;Before I believed in the Lord, my whole being was empty and without peace. There was no harmony in my family, and I was on the verge of divorcing my wife, but now my wife is sitting right next to me. Thank the Lord. He has saved our family and our marriage, and He has given us two lovely babies. These are all God&rsquo;s blessings.&rdquo; When people hear such a testimony, they will feel very warm. Then the wife may say something as well, testifying how her husband&rsquo;s disposition changed completely after he believed in the Lord. This kind of testimony does not require any eloquence. If the children are a little older and are clear about their salvation, we can even ask them to give their testimonies. In this way, before the testimonies are finished, our gospel friends will be completely subdued and open to the Lord.</p>
<p>Many brothers and sisters have been saved because of the testimonies they heard in a gospel meeting. While a gospel message may not get into people, the testimonies of the saints always penetrate into people. After giving a testimony, a brief word on the gospel can be given, but it does not have to be a lengthy discourse. We only need to give people a short word concerning the gospel. We should build up the habit of knowing verses that can easily lead people to salvation and even put these verses on the table or mark them in our Bible so that we will be able to use them when the time comes to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>John 3:16 is a very useful verse. After the testimonies, we can ask everyone to read this portion of the Bible together. We may have read this portion many times in the past, but it will be fresh to our gospel friends. Once this word is imparted into them, they will have a sense of the weightiness of the Word. Although testimonies can unveil people, there is still the need for the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Reading the Word causes people to have a deep impression of what we have spoken.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel in our homes, everyone should speak. The members of the household should strengthen the meeting with personal testimonies of their salvation and with some speaking on the gospel. We can also invite people to ask questions. Many of today&rsquo;s young people will not agree with the gospel when they first hear it; they always have some questions. When we speak about one thing, they may ask about another thing. Sometimes they will even &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; with you for some additional time before making a decision. In such circumstances, we need to be patient when we speak to them. In big meetings, there is absolutely no opportunity for this kind of interaction, but in our homes there is an opportunity for them to express themselves. Many times young people have questions and by allowing them the freedom to ask, their problems can be resolved. When we preach the gospel in our homes, we can do many things that cannot be done in big meetings. We can freely give our testimonies, and our gospel friends can freely ask questions. This can be done only in small group gatherings in our homes.</p><h2 class="head2">Coordinating with Neighboring Saints<br />
to Preach the Gospel</h2>
<p>In some homes there are only husbands and wives because all the children have left home. Thus, they may think that there is not enough support for them to preach the gospel in their home. In such a case, they can ask others who are nearby to join them; thus, they can have a gospel meeting with two or three families who live nearby. This will not cause the free nature of preaching the gospel at home to be lost, and at the same time, there will be more impact in preaching the gospel. Sometimes we need to combine our homes together, but we should not do this in a rigid way. We should not have fixed rules about the number of families that come together. We should always be flexible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following the Lord&rsquo;s Leading<br />
to Have Specific Prayers</h2>
<p>It is easy for us to neglect to pray for our relatives, friends, and neighbors. We should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to petition specifically for the more hopeful ones to be saved. We all have some experience in praying for people, but many times our prayers are too general. We ask the Lord to gospelize Taiwan, but we have little way to determine whether or not the Lord has heard our prayers. However, if we pray specifically for our relatives and friends one by one, we will pay attention to whether or not the Lord has heard our prayers. Hence, this is a very good opportunity for us to exercise our spirit and faith to see the Lord&rsquo;s faithfulness.</p>
<p>It is a great strengthening to our faith when we see a person turn and believe in the Lord after praying for him for many months. We all need to learn this lesson. This is not a heavy burden; it is an exercise as well as an enjoyment. We all should pray for our relatives, friends, and neighbors. If we have too many relatives and friends, we need to have specific prayers. In their initial zeal some brothers and sisters write down a hundred names and make a determination to pray for them every day. In the end, they do not pray for anyone. Hence, we do not need to focus on too many people at the same time. The best way is to focus on three to five, always looking to the Lord for them in a thorough way. The effect of this constant looking to the Lord will gradually be manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Giving Out Gospel Literature and Gospel Tracts</h2>
<p>We want to stir up the spirit of the gospel throughout all the churches in Taiwan. Through gospel tracts and gospel literature, we should spread the gospel all over Taiwan. The gospel is preached not only with our mouths but also with our hands. We can open our mouth to testify for the Lord and also testify through the activities of our hands. If three thousand saints are willing to distribute one gospel tract every day, three thousand tracts would be handed out every day. If each saint handed out ten tracts, thirty thousand tracts would be distributed. In this way Taiwan would soon be filled with gospel tracts.</p>
<p>Although the gospel is very common today, we still know that many people have never heard about the Lord Jesus. Their hearts are open, and they would believe if they heard the gospel. Hence, we need to do all that we can to sow the seed of the gospel. Today both truth and lies go side by side. If truth does not spread, lies become prevailing. In today&rsquo;s society people believe many things that are not true, because they are constantly repeated and spread. We should speak and spread the precious truth that is in our hands even more.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Using Bible Verses and Hymns Skillfully</h2>
<p>Hymns are the best weapon in preaching the gospel. A man&rsquo;s mind is harder than his heart, and changing his mind is more difficult than touching his heart. Hymns are the best tool for touching a man&rsquo;s heart. We have many gospel hymns, and we should learn them one by one so that we can sing and declare them all the time. For example, <em>Hymns,</em> #1024 speaks of our need for Jesus, and <em>Hymns,</em> #1080 speaks of the vanity of everything. We should learn these hymns, and we can write them on paper and put them up in the house, or we can make note cards and place them on the dining table. Then when people come to our house, we can sing these hymns with them.</p>
<p>Today we have things that people did not have thirty years ago, such as tape recorders and other audio devices. We can make good use of them to play gospel hymns at home. We can give tapes to those who drive to work, and we can play songs to those who ride with us to work. In the office, if circumstances allow, we can play music for people during our break times. We should make good use of every opportunity. People may oppose us if we preach the gospel, but no one will oppose us if we sing hymns. Singing hymns will sow the seed of the gospel into people, little by little. We should not only use the Bible verses in a flexible way but also use the hymns in a flexible way. The effective preaching of the gospel depends on our flexibility. We need to spread the gospel through big meetings and small groups, through contacting people and making phone calls, and through tracts and tape recorders. After we have done all these things, some results will gradually be manifested.</p>
<p>We cannot expect everyone to be an evangelist; nor can we expect everyone to be eloquent and gifted. Yet if every saint is faithful before the Lord and willing to gain at least one person each year, our numbers will certainly increase. The new way that the Lord has given us is a practical way. I hope that this burden and this way can be brought into the small groups to make every brother and sister a person who participates in the move of the gospel as well as a person who propagates the gospel. In this way, the Lord will have a more rapid increase and a more rapid spread among us.</p></body></html>
