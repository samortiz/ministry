   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 11 Scripture Reading: Acts 4:1-31</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter three of Acts Peter presents Christ, the Healer, as God s Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed in whom all families of the earth will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because this Healer is the Author of life, whenever we call on Him we enjoy a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Prophet, He speaks God to us, and in Him as the seed of Abraham we are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All these aspects of Christ as the wonderful Healer are for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in Acts 3 we do not see that this Healer is for God s economy, God s purpose, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in chapter four Peter was given the opportunity to present this Healer in a further way, presenting Him as a stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning this, 4:11 and 12 say, This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And there is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this message we shall give a further word on Christ as the stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE CORNERSTONE OF GOD S HABITATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God came in incarnation to be a stone for the building up of His universal habitation, but the Jewish leaders, who should have been the builders, despised this stone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, God made Him the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more the Jewish leaders rejected Him, the more God used Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, He was a stone only in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But after the rejection by the Jewish leaders, God in resurrection made Him the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At first He was a common stone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then Jewish leaders rejected Him by killing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God honored Him by raising Him up from among the dead and making Him a particular stone, the cornerstone, the very prominent stone that joins the walls of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the cornerstone of God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PETER S KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST AS THE STONE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 1 we see that Andrew brought his brother, Simon Peter, to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas which translated means a stone v. 42 . Later, in Caesarea Philippi, the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, But you, who do you say that I am? Matt 16:15 . Peter took the lead to declare, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . In His response to Peter, the Lord said, I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church v. 18 . Here the name Peter means a stone, which is material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, You are Peter, a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I will build my church with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No doubt, the Lord s word must have made a deep impression on Peter, even though it is not likely that he understood it at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, after the life-giving Spirit had been breathed into him and after the economical Spirit had blown upon him, Peter became a man of Spirit, a man with the essential Spirit within him and the economical Spirit upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As such a man he surely began to understand the Lord s word concerning him being a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter might have said to himself, I recall that when I first met the Lord, He said that He would give me a new name, a name that means stone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later He called me Peter and said that He would build His church upon a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now I understand what the Lord was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Having this understanding, Peter in Acts 4 could present the Lord Jesus as the stone despised by the builders but which has become the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, when he had become old, he wrote his first Epistle, in which he spoke of the Lord as the living stone and of the believers as living stones for God s building: To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:4-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Acts 3 and 4, Peter knew the Healer not only as God s Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed in whom all the earth would be blessed; he also knew Him as the stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not believe that throughout the centuries many have taught from the Word that Jesus Christ is a stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not only the Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, the Prophet, and the seed; He is a stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to 4:12, this stone is the One in whom we can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, He is the Stone-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the Stone-Savior, He is solid, strong, and reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can rely on Him and stand on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This stone is the rock, the foundation stone, and the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Zechariah 4:7 we see that He is even the topstone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s building is entirely of Christ.</S>
