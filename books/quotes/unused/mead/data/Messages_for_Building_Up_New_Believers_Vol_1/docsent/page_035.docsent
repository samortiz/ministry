   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Becoming the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Together with All the Members</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Third, we are joined together in the Body of Christ to become one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 4:4 says that there is one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 12:12 says that there are many members but one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses show us that it is impossible for a Christian to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a member in God s family, I may be a peculiar person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It may be possible for me not to communicate with all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as there is no problem between my father and me, I can shut myself in as a solitary child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As God s dwelling place, even though I am a living stone, I can be left alone if I do not like to be built with others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before Peter joined the church, he was a living stone, but he still was an individual one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may say, I do not care if this means leaving a hole in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let there be a hole; I want to be an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is possible to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, there is something more than being the family and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God says that we are one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps you are an eye, a hand, or a leg in the body today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>An eye is only useful when it is on the head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If it is put in a glass bottle, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A leg is only useful when it is placed in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it is hung in an upper room, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please remember that the body and each member functions in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No member can be separated from other members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This relationship is an indissoluble one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One may argue that he can be separated from God s family and from God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But it is impossible for anyone to say that he can be separated from the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your ear cannot declare independence just because it is unhappy with the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, your hand cannot declare independence just because it is unhappy with the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your leg cannot stand up and say, I want to be left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have no other choice but to be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life we have received does not allow us to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has not given us an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must emphasize this fact the Lord has not given us a life that is independent in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life that we have received is sustained by the life of others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we had received an independent life, we could live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we have received a dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to depend on our brothers and sisters, and they have to depend on us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please remember that a member can never stand alone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once it is alone, it cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once it is isolated, it loses all the riches, all the life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the saints and I are indeed one Body, I can no longer be an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By now this should be more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life I have received demands that I be joined to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>D. Every Christian Becoming One</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>by Attaching Himself to Other Christians</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that you will join yourself to other Christians once you become a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not remain a loner after you are a Christian for eight or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we have become Christians, we have to see that the life we received from God is a dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has not given us an independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are Christians attached to many other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Among us, no one is detached.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All Christians are attached to other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You have heard of offices that are attached to a company.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have heard of departments that are attached to a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You also have heard of people who are attached to a working unit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same way, every Christian is attached to other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everyone is attached to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the eyes of God, no Christian has the strength to exist alone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hope that you will be attached to others from the beginning; I hope that you will be a Christian who lives by attaching yourself to many other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Through this attachment, you receive the supply, the building up, the love, and the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the reason that a Christian has to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The phrase joining the church is a non-biblical expression.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, we borrow this expression for the sake of the new ones understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot be private Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We only can be Christians who join together with all of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We only can be Christians who are attached to other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should be involved with other people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should be like the vines of a climbing plant always attached to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As Christians we should attach ourselves to other Christians.</S>
