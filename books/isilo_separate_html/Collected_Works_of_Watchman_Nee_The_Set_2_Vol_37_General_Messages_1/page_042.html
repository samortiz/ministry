One is the failure to know themselves, and the other is the failure to know the riches of the Lord. It would be wonderful if a Christian knew himself and knew the riches of the Lord. If he does not know himself or the Lord's riches, he is doomed to failure. All shortcomings, failures, and things that do not glorify God in the Christian life can be traced to one of these two deficiencies. These two matters are the roots of all our failures. On the one hand, the Lord's work on us shows us what we are and, on the other hand, what He is. If we knew ourselves and if we knew Him, all spiritual problems would be solved.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>At this point I would like to bring one thing to our attention. What is the necessary condition for experiencing the Lord's riches? In other words, what is the necessary condition for receiving God's blessing or the working of the Holy Spirit? This is something we must see; it is a condition which we must fulfill. If we do not meet this condition, we cannot expect to receive anything from the Lord. This necessary condition is being empty before God. If we want to be filled with the Lord's riches continually, we have to be emptied continually. The emptying experience is an ever-deepening experience. Therefore, we can never say that we are completely empty or that we cannot be emptied any further. Brothers and sisters, we need to be emptied day after day, month after month, and year after year. We may be empty now, but after some time we will need a further emptying work. We should not think that once we are emptied, we will be empty forever. We also should not think that once we are filled, we will be filled forever. We should have an ever-deepening knowledge of ourselves, and we should have an ever-deepening knowledge of the riches of the Lord.</p><p>Luke 1:53 says, "The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty." This verse shows us that God's grace is reserved for one type of person&mdash;a hungry one. If a person comes to the meeting only for the purpose of observing and listening, he will not see anything or hear anything. If all that a person wants is some Bible knowledge, his real spiritual problems will not be solved. Only those with a pressing inward need and those who are determined to meet God will receive His blessing. We must realize that spiritual progress is based on our hunger. Matthew 5:6 says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied." Those who hunger and thirst will be filled; they are the ones who are blessed.</p><p>According to the Word of God and the experience of many saints, the first thing the Holy Spirit does within a person (which is the same work He does within everyone) is to create a longing heart in him. All spiritual progress begins when God initiates a good work in a person through the Holy Spirit by creating a longing within. Every time there is any spiritual progress, the Holy Spirit has initiated it. The Holy Spirit makes us feel dissatisfied with our present condition; the Holy Spirit makes us feel that our present condition is wrong and that our spiritual life is too shallow. The first work of the Holy Spirit is to give us a sense of dissatisfaction and to create in us a desire to be better. Brothers and sisters, if we want to have any spiritual progress, we must first become dissatisfied with our present spiritual condition, and we must seek for something better. This is the beginning of spiritual progress. Putting it another way, all failure and decadence is the result of self-complacency. The beginning of failure is self-complacency. Our feelings of dissatisfaction with ourselves indicates the Holy Spirit has begun His work in us and that is the time for us to go forward. Whenever we are ignorant of our poverty and deficiency, we have come to a standstill. Decadence comes from self-complacency, whereas progress comes from hunger. This is a fact, and it is true throughout our Christian life. Invariably the Holy Spirit first creates a desire in us for more, and then God comes in to satisfy us and fill us. In order to perform His filling work, He must first carry out His emptying work. When we are empty, God will fill us.</p><p>Some brothers and sisters have a genuine desire before the Lord and are genuinely conscious of their deficiencies and shortcomings. They earnestly hope to live a better and fuller life. However, they do not know how they can achieve this, and they do not know how they can have an abundant life. Brothers and sisters, if we have such a feeling, we can rest assured that this life will be ours. This is because the desire does not originate from ourselves but from the work of the Holy Spirit in us. We should realize that God Himself fills up whatever He has emptied. God will not leave us empty forever; His purpose is to fill us. Since God has emptied us, He will surely fill us. If He did not want to fill us, He would not have emptied us in the first place. Emptying is merely the means; filling is the goal. Therefore, God never empties anyone without filling him again. If there is a longing heart in us, it proves that we are already under the operating power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit never engages Himself in a fruitless work. The only question is whether or not there is some hindrance within us. If there is a genuine desire within us, we will certainly receive what we desire. Please bear in mind and be deeply impressed that once the Holy Spirit begins His work, He always finishes it. He will never stop until the job is done. Therefore, we may rest assured that when we are empty, He will fill us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
