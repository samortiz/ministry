   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit of God Coming upon Balaam,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Balaam Prophesying in a Parable</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of God came upon Balaam, and he took up his parable and said, "The word of Balaam the son of Beor,/The word of the man whose eye is opened,/The word of him who hears the speaking of God,/Who sees the vision of the Almighty,/Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3b-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrases "whose eye is opened" and "who hears the speaking of God" indicate that the prophet was on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His falling down with his eyes uncovered indicates that he cooperated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 5 Balaam says, "How fair are your tents, O Jacob,/Your dwelling places, O Israel!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This reminds us of Balaam's word concerning Israel in his first two parables.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first parable he said, "Behold, a people that will dwell alone,/And will not reckon themselves among the nations" 23:9b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This word indicates that Israel is a holy people, a people separated, or sanctified, unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the sight of God, Israel stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to God's view, Israel, even today, is not reckoned among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have God's view, we will regard Israel as a particular and separate people, as a sanctified and holy nation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In his second parable Balaam said, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel" 23:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that, in the sight of God, Israel is without fault.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first parable reveals that Israel is holy, and the second, that Israel is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we need to see that, according to the third parable, Israel is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Israel's beauty is indicated by the word "fair."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the sight of God, Israel is holy, sinless, and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In standing she is holy, in kind she is perfect, and in appearance she is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This reveals that God has chosen, redeemed, saved, separated, uplifted, perfected, and beautified this people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the Bible, this will be the actual situation of Israel during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews are not welcomed by the nations in this age, but they will be welcomed by the nations after the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God promised that the descendants of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations Gen 12:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually the Jews will be fully blessed by God, and they will be a blessing to the entire human race.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Numbers 24:6 Balaam continues his description of Israel: "Like valleys that stretch afar,/Like gardens beside a river;/Like aloes that Jehovah has planted,/Like cedar trees beside the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here Israel is likened to valleys, which usually are green, and to gardens beside a river.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Aloe is a plant known for its healing effect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus was buried with aloes John 19:39.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the coming back of the Lord Jesus, Israel will be a healing to the nations, and that healing will be a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Numbers 24:7a says, "Water shall flow from his buckets, /And his seed shall be in many waters."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that Israel will have an abundant supply of water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The water of a country is related to the riches of that country.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more water a nation has, the more riches it will have.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without water, the land would be a desert.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 7b Balaam goes on to say, "His king shall be higher than Agag,/And his kingdom shall be exalted."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Agag was the king of the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Balaam's word here is a prophecy that eventually has its fulfillment in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 8 and 9 are somewhat a repetition of 23:22 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both portions say that God brings Israel out of Egypt and that Israel has "as it were the horns of the wild ox."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, in both portions Israel is likened to a lion and a lioness.</S>
