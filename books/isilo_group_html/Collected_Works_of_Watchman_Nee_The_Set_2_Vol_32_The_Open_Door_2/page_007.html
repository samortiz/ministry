I can tell from the letters that he has a deeper contact with the Lord. He often goes with Brother Kuo Bu-yueh and Paul Tsao to visit the sick soldiers in the hospital in Ch'ang-sha, and the Lord has used them.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi<br />June 24</p><h2 class="head2">A Few Places in Southeast Asia</h2><p>Malaysia is a vast land. Although there are meetings in Sitiawan, Penang, and Singapore, so far they have been very conservative and have not done much outreach. Not only is there no preaching of the gospel in the various provinces, but the footsteps of the gospel messengers have not even touched these thousands of villages. Last year when Mr. Nee (Watchman) came and inspected all these places, he saw the need of the work in Southeast Asia. When Mr. Faithful Luk came, he concentrated mainly on Singapore and the few places around Singapore. Now God has begun His work in the meeting in Singapore, and the number of saved ones has drastically increased. Malacca and Yung-Ping Harbor had some seeds sown through men coming from Chuanchow and Singapore. When Mr. Luk went there for his pioneering work, a meeting was started in Malacca. Yung-Ping Harbor also began to have a meeting. The door to Ma-Po has also opened. Mr. Wilson Wong went to Sitiawan and started a Bible study two weeks ago this past month. There are still many places without any work yet. Please pray to the Lord to send men to work in all these places.</p><p>A weak brother,<br />Chang Nai-tsung, April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><p>I heard that Surabaya started the Lord's table on May 22 to remember the Lord. Yung-Ping Harbor rented a place for meeting, and some were baptized. It so happened that Brother Leland Wang was on his way there for his work. On that Lord's Day, these ones were baptized and they began to break bread. Last week Brother Wang Tsi came to Singapore to conduct a few meetings, and the opportunities were great. This week we are having our meetings in the Gospel Hall, and every night the seats are filled. Praise the Lord for His grace! This Thursday I intend to go to Penang because the brothers have been inviting me for a long time. May the Lord preserve the work there. Please pray for me.</p><p>Faithful Luk<br />May 25</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
