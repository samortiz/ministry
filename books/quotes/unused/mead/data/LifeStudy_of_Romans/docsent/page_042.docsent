   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOUR REIGNING THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen two men, two acts, and two results.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two men with their two acts and two results have brought in four reigning things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to know these men, acts, and results, and we also have to know the four reigning things in order to be clear about Romans 5:12-21.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Sin 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Having Entered through the First Man</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, sin entered through the first man 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the disobedience of Adam, the evil one, as sin, entered into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The world here refers to mankind in general, for, in a sense, the word world in the New Testament means mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, John 3:16 says that God loved the world, meaning that God loved mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, sin has entered into mankind, into human nature, through the first man Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dwelling in Man s Fallen Body</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After entering into the human race, sin made its dwelling place in the fallen body of man 7:17, 18, 21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin does not dwell in our mind, soul, or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sin s lodging is our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul said that sin dwelt within him, that the law of sin was in the members of his body, and that in his flesh was nothing good, only sin 7:17, 18, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin dwells in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although our body was created by God as good, it became flesh once sin had been injected into it and had made its home there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although God created our body, He did not create the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The flesh is a mixture of God s creation with sin, the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the body has become the flesh, and sin dwells in this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every kind of lust has its source in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Having the Law as Its Power</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sin has the law as its power 1 Cor 15:56; Rom 7:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without law, sin is powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Romans 7:11, sin kills us through the law because the law gives sin its power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin uses the law as a knife to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 15:56 says, The strength of sin is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not touch the law, for if you do, you will touch the killing knife of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are absolutely unable to keep the law, and it is foolish for us even to try.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we attempt to keep the law, sin will use the law to kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reigning in Death</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sin reigns in death 5:21; 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sin, like every other king, needs an authority in order to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The authority of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sin has authority to reign as a king in death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 5:21 and 6:12 show sin reigning as a king.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sin is in our flesh, our fallen body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This sin is not an act of wrongdoing; it is the personification of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans 7:21 Paul said that the evil was present with him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word translated the evil in this verse is kakos, a word denoting that which is evil in character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This must refer to the evil character of Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have no doubt that the sin which has entered into our body is the incarnation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When man ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, that fruit entered his being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In fact, everything we eat comes into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have already seen, the tree of life in the garden denoted God, and the tree of knowledge signified Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when man partook of the tree of knowledge, man took Satan, the evil one, into him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The body created by God originally had no evil in it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible says that the man created by God was very good and upright Gen 1:31; Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>7:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, after the fall another element was injected into man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That element was sin, the very nature of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This sin reigns in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Its power is the law and it reigns in death.</S>
