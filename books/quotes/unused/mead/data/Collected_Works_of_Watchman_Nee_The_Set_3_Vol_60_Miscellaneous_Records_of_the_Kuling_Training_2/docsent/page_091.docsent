   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Refutation of the Particular Error</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Judaizers concerning</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Keeping of Sabbath The Sabbath Being for Jews Only</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us now come to the teaching of the Bible concerning the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible the first mention of the Sabbath is in Genesis 2:3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After God finished His work of creation, He rested on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After this, there was no mention of the Sabbath until two thousand and five hundred years later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Exodus 16:29 God gave the Sabbath to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He made the keeping of the Sabbath a law and told the Israelites to keep this law: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" 20:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Exodus 31:13 and 17 Jehovah said to the Israelites, "Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations....It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Ezekiel 20:12 He said that He gave the Sabbath to the children of Israel for the purpose of sanctifying them and making them His people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God told the Israelites that the keeping of the Sabbath was a sign of their deliverance from Egypt Deut 5:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From these verses we see clearly that the Sabbath was given by God to the Jews as a sign that they were the redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Handwriting in the Law Being Wiped Out</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us now consider Paul's teaching concerning the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said that the Sabbath is a thing of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Colossians 2:13-14 he said, "And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses; wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The handwriting refers to the entire law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord wiped out the entire law on the cross because this law was against us and contrary to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord demands holiness, yet we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the law, we can never be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason it says that the law is against us and contrary to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By being crucified for us, the Lord wiped out the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are now able to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Judaizers say that the Lord's crucifixion only removed the ceremonial law, not the moral law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They say that the moral law still stands, but Paul said that the Lord has wiped out all the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In reality the Bible does not make a clear distinction between moral laws and ceremonial laws.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Judaizers say that the new moon and the feasts belong to the ceremonial laws; these have indeed been wiped away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But they say that the Ten Commandments belong to the moral laws and should still be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible does not teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not separate moral laws from ceremonial laws.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All ceremonial laws are moral in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sacrifices are moral, and the ordinances regarding eating and drinking are moral in significance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is like the fourth commandment in the Decalog the keeping of the Sabbath; it is moral in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Colossians shows clearly that the entire handwriting in ordinances was wiped out, not just the ceremonial laws.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The handwriting refers to the document of a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is like a contract, a signed pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Exodus 19:8 tells us that after God gave the Ten Commandments, the Israelites responded immediately, saying, "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They did not make a distinction between ceremonial and moral laws.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the handwriting includes the moral laws; it does not refer merely to ceremonial laws.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to point out to new ones the meaning of this handwriting so that they will know that all the handwriting of the law that was against us and contrary to us was wiped out and nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 7:7 speaks of the existence of the law, while Colossians 2:14 shows us that the law is wiped out and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 16 follows verse 14, saying, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The entire law has been wiped out before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can quote Exodus 19:8 and show them that the Jews did not make a distinction between ceremonial and moral laws.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only way for us to deal with the Judaizers is to tell them that the law is not separated into parts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Colossians 2:16 says that since the law is wiped out, everything related to eating, drinking, feasts, new moon, or the Sabbath should be done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These things have nothing whatsoever to do with a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Judaizers may respond by saying that the Sabbath does not refer to the regular Sabbath in a week, but the Sabbaths within the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But they should know better that the word Sabbaths in Colossians is plural, as the word feasts is also plural.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This includes all the Sabbaths and feasts of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since Sabbaths is plural, there is no distinction as to whether the weekly Sabbath or the feast-time Sabbaths are referred to; both are included.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more inclusive term always includes the less inclusive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Any Sabbath is included in the word Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one can say that weekly Sabbaths are not included in Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul knew the Jews in Colossae; they never paid attention to the feast-time Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To them the important thing was the weekly Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason Paul wrote a letter and told them that a Christian is free from feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only recently can we find men making a distinction between weekly Sabbaths and feast-time Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In verse 17 Paul said, "Which are a shadow of the things to come."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are not worthy of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No Christian should allow another to judge him in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The which in verse 17 refers to all the things spoken of in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we read further, we will be clear that both the ceremonial as well as the moral laws are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we come to the "law regarding the husband" in Romans 7:2, the Judaizers again argue that this refers to the ceremonial law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 7 says, "Neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, You shall not covet.'"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Judaizers readily concede that this law is part of the Ten Commandments, and therefore, is moral, not ceremonial.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From its context, however, we can see that this law, as one of the commandments of the Decalog, is the very "law regarding the husband" spoken of in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Judaizers contradict what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Actually, we are free from all laws, moral or ceremonial.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Paul said that we are freed from our husband, he was referring to the law of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through our crucifixion with Christ, we are freed from the first husband, which is to be freed from all the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Second Corinthians 3:7, 9 through 10, and 13 show the difference between the ministry of the law and the ministry of the spirit; it shows the difference between Moses' ministry and Christ's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The law which is engraved on the stone belongs to the ministry of death; it is a ministry of condemnation and is to be done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"The end of that which was being done away with" clearly refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Judaizers admit that the law kills, but they resort to their only excuse, saying that this refers to the ceremonial law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We know that not all the laws were engraved in stone; only the moral laws, that is, the Decalog, were engraved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The ceremonial laws were never engraved in stone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Moses' ministry is a ministry of death engraved in stone.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Clearly, the ministry that will be done away with includes the moral law.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today this law is engraved in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 we see only a contrast between the tablets of stone and the tablets of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are freed from all the laws, including the ceremonial laws and the moral laws.</S>
