   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE GIFTS ACCORDING TO GRACE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:6a, 1-2, 11; Eph 4:7-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apparently Romans 12 is easy to understand, but in actuality it is not easy to get into this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Again we may compare it to the title of God referred to by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 22:32: The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems that it is easy to understand that God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, there is something in this title that requires a certain amount of spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Romans 12 it is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GIFTS DIFFERING ACCORDING TO GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 6a says, And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here the gifts are according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that not many Christians know what gifts...according to the grace means.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the grace mentioned here?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the difference between gifts and grace?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And what does it mean that gifts differ according to the grace?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grace may be compared to the blood supply in the members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a member has a bigger capacity for the blood supply, then it has a bigger gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it has a smaller capacity for the blood supply, the size of the gift in that member is smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our little finger, the capacity for the blood supply is very small, so its gift, that is, its function, is also small in size.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Romans 12 the gift is the function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 4 tells us that the members are given to the Body as gifts, but Romans 12 tells us that the functions are given to the members as gifts respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Ephesians 4 the gifts are to the Body while in Romans 12 the gifts are to the members.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The latter gifts are the functions given to the separate members as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The arm is given to a physical body as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition, a gift is given to the arm as a function so that it can do something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This function is given to this member as a gift according to the measure of the capacity of how much blood supply the member has.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there is a bigger capacity for the blood supply to come in, then the gift is bigger.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there is a smaller capacity for the blood supply to come in, then the gift is smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we can say that the gift, or the function, comes out of the capacity for the blood supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the proper meaning of gifts differing according to the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Grace is Christ as life to us, Christ within as the blood supply, the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As members, the kind of gift, or function, that we have depends on the quantity of Christ as life that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have more grace, that is, more Christ, then the function given to us will be bigger.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have only a small amount of Christ, if our capacity to take Christ in is small and limited, we can have only a small function; the function that is given to us will be very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why Romans 12:6 tells us that the gifts differ according to the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord gave the apostle Paul a very big function as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we had such a great capacity to contain Christ, we also would have a function like Paul s. The gift is given according to the capacity of grace, that is, of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BEING FREED FROM OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TO PRESENT OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can we have the capacity to contain grace, Christ as life, within us?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Romans 12 there are three matters related to the three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, we have to offer our body v. 1 . This is to free our body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not let our body be occupied by things other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Too often our body is occupied, not released.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I agree that the young people have to study in college and the universities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I always encourage people to get a proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, I am not happy to see the young brothers fully occupied by their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes they do not even come to the meetings because they say they are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their body is fully occupied by studies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To study is right, but it is not right to be fully occupied by studies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the same with taking care of our home.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To clean and keep our home in a proper way is right, but we should not be occupied in our body by housework.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our body is occupied by home affairs, then how can we function?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I would suggest that if you do not have much time, then you should sacrifice a little of your studies and home affairs in order to set your body free from any kind of occupation, so that you may function and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this country as well as in the Far East, some sisters and brothers keep their homes brilliant, but they do not have any time to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the Lord s Day a sister may have time to come to the church meeting only to bring some money and drop it into the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To her this means that she has done her duty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, she may spend much time to keep her home with its decorations and bright floors.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To spend too much time keeping our home is a kind of luxury.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to keep our home in a proper way, but only to that extent.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Compare our situation with the lives of the Lord and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They did not spend time to prepare a brilliant home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot bring our home into the New Jerusalem, so no doubt that is a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eventually it will go into the trash can, not into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we spend too much time on something that will go to the trash can, it is better to spend it on something else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not agree that we should keep our home in a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to have a proper home, but only that much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our body is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to free our body for the Lord s service, for our function.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Why can we not function?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is because we are too occupied by our studies, our home, or our business.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some brothers are too occupied by their business.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Last year they made five million dollars, this year they want to make eight million, and next year they want ten million.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If they do this, they will not be able to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Learn to set your body free.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not occupy it with so many things other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the meaning of Romans 12:1, which tells us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not offer ourselves in an abstract way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must have a concrete offering.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The concrete offering is the offering of ourselves in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everything must be done in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is to set our body free from occupations and preoccupations.</S>
