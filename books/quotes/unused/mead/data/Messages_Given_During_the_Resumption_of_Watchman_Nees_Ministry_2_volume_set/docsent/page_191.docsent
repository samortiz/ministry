   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Whole Body Consecrating,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ushering In a Thorough Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last year I asked a student at the Chiao-tung University how he would feel if someone were to hit him on his right cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If someone hit your right cheek, you would be angry when you go home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, those who are joyful before the Lord are the ones who, after being hit on the right cheek, turn their left cheek to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a person has been hit twice, he will be joyful, and he will be able to utter praise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's way is the way of absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are not absolute cannot sing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am not begging people to come to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am showing you that you are a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God wants you to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This time our conference is a co-workers' conference, but this does not mean that the responsibility is only on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, the responsibility is on the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we read 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12, we see that service belongs to the whole Body; it is not a service of three or five special people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, we asked all the brothers and sisters to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What the Lord wants is absolute service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We hope that every brother and sister can get through in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord wants such an absolute service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only the co-workers need coordination in their work; every brother and sister needs to be coordinated also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE ONLY SERVICE THAT COUNTS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING THE BODY SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I want to ask the brothers a few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What kind of service is considered real service?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The only service that counts is the service in which the whole Body serves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only the Body service can be counted as real service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Either you are not a Christian at all, or you have to be a serving Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FULL COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BRINGING IN THE BODY SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to have the Body service, there is the need for coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a loose arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If my hands are connected to my body, they will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if they are locked up upstairs, they will not be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the time you have been a Christian, have you ever inquired of the Lord concerning your job, your house, and your business?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is your job suitable for the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a man moves to a new place, he considers whether the place is beneficial to him spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But he never considers whether the job he takes will help him to give himself to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, our co-workers cannot seek for their own convenience in the work; they cannot freely choose their own field.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should in principle do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to hand over your job, and you should learn to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, all the brothers and sisters are co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone should hand himself over for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is to be coordination, it has to be a coordination of all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some of us have to change our dwelling or our occupations, and all of us have to offer up our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may cause some to have heartaches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to realize that from the very beginning the Lord requires that we serve this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Any service that drags its feet along is not joyful and clear-cut service.</S>
