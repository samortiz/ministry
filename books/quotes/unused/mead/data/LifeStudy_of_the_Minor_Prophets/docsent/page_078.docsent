   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people Hag 1:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see the response of God s elect, who were stirred up by the Lord in the order of God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they responded by being stirred up in their spirit by the Lord, we all were included.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Minor Prophets there are both the divine Spirit, the consummated Spirit of God, and the human spirit, the stirred-up spirit of God s elect.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every day we cannot avoid the stirring up of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible reveals that once the consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit comes into us, He will never leave.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As He dwells in us, He is often a troublemaker, stirring us up either negatively or positively.</S>
