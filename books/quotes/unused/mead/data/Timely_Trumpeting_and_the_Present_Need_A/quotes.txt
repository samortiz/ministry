[1]  If we take the old way of Christianity and meet in its traditional way, we can build up only a congregation or an organization; we can never build up the organic Body of Christ.
[2]  When we consider the building up of the Body of Christ, we find it is related to one basic question: What is the relationship between the apostles and the churches, and the relationship between the apostles and the elders?
[3]  The Head gave the apostles; the apostles appoint the elders; the elders lead the saints; the saints constitute the local churches which are for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[4]  I. THE BASIC QUALIFICATIONS OF AN APOSTLE A. Having Received the Revelation concerning
[5]  The first of these is that an apostle must be one who has received the revelation of God s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church Matt 16:16-18; Gal 1:11-12 .
[6]  An apostle must not only be one who can preach the gospel and lead sinners unto Christ to be saved, he must also be one who can raise up local churches and appoint elders who will lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee Acts 14:23; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:2 .
[7]  It is difficult enough to raise up a local church; but it is more difficult to select men from the church to be elders who can lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee the church.
[8]  In addition, he must be able to raise up a local church and to raise up men among the saints and appoint them as elders for leading, shepherding, teaching, and overseeing.
[9]  By thoroughly reading the various parts of the New Testament concerning this matter and by studying and searching Brother Watchman Nee s writings, we found out that the apostles, after raising up churches and appointing elders, continued unceasingly to care for the churches they had established and to lead and train the elders they had appointed.
[10]  In the case of the Apostle Paul, we see an apostle not only endeavoring to visit and strengthen the churches established by him, but also frequently writing to teach, comfort, encourage, exhort, rebuke, charge, guide, and warn the churches he has established 1 Thes 4:1, 9, 18; 5:27; 2 Thes 2:1-2; 1 Cor 1:10; 4:14; 5:9; 7:10; 11:17; 16:1; 2 Cor 1:6; 9:1; 13:1-2 .
[11]  This proves that after an apostle raises up a church and appoints some elders, he should still continue his labor by writing to them and by teaching, comforting, encouraging, and warning this church that he has established.
[12]  Ephesians 4:11-12 tells us that the ascended Head gave gifts, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[13]  This word shows in a strong way that after the apostles appoint the elders and entrust the churches they have established to the care of the local elders, it is never the case that they then take their hands completely off and have nothing more to do with the churches.
[14]  After the apostles appoint the elders, the elders still have to receive the instructions and leading from the apostles 1 Tim 3:14-15; Titus 1:5-9; Acts 20:17-18a, 28-32, 35 , although the responsibility for the care and leading of the church is entrusted to the elders.
[15]  The apostles are there to help the elders of a local church so that the elders would know how to manage the affairs of the church.
[16]  An example of such occurred when Paul sent from Miletus for the elders in the church in Ephesus in order to help them and let them know how to manage the church in Ephesus so that the church there would grow spiritually.
[17]  Not only do the apostles have the duty and authority to appoint the elders, they also have the duty and authority to remove them 1 Tim 5:19-20 .
[18]  Although we live in the church, we never try to find out what the church is all about, nor do we try to find out what our responsibilities are in the church.
[19]  Although we are in the Lord s recovery, considering our work and the results we have produced, we are far from the building up of the Body of Christ.
[20]  I. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF APOSTLES A. Those Appointed Directly by the Lord
[21]  A. Those apostles like Peter, John, and Paul, who are directly appointed by the Lord or who are constituted directly by the Lord s revelation, are on equal standing.
[22]  As a result, they and the saints whom they have perfected are completely one in the ministry s work of building up the Body of Christ.
[23]  They are all priests to God, and they all function as members of the Body of Christ, working together with the gifted ones to do the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[24]  These matters show us clearly that firstly, all the different kinds of apostles share in the unique work of the New Testament ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ, and that secondly, all the saints perfected by these different kinds of apostles also share in this unique work of the New Testament ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[25]  When the saints in the local churches work together with the different kinds of gifts to do the work of the ministry, there is the building up of the Body of Christ.
[26]  In this message we will cover the administration of a local church by locality and the organic building up of the Body of Christ.
[27]  The local churches should be organic; they should not be organizational.
[28]  After we are saved and begin to love the Lord, and even after we have become elders, within we are still full of organizational thoughts.
[29]  First Peter 5:1-3 says, Therefore, the elders among you I entreat, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed: shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly, nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock.
[30]  Ephesians 4:11-12 mentions different gifted members perfecting the saints unto the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[31]  The work of the gifts is the perfecting of the saints for the work of the building up of the Body of Christ.
[32]  Yet the local building is not for the building up of a congregation in a locality, but for the Body of Christ.
[33]  But the building up of the local churches in the various localities should not be for the realization of a congregation in the various localities, but for the Body of Christ in the universe.
[34]  For example, a certain church may have its bread-breaking meeting on the Lord s Day evening, while another church would have it on the Lord s Day morning.
[35]  To practice 1 Corinthians 14:26, there is the need of revival and an overcoming living; to practice Ephesians 4:11-16, there is the need of total consecration.
[36]  In everything seek the growth in life, and in all things grow up into the Head, which is Christ.
[37]  We need to love Christ and the members of His Body, not for our own interest, inclination, or goal, but in the love of Christ, who is in us, that we may grow up into the Head, Christ, in everything.
[38]  When each member of the Body of Christ is perfected one by one in this way, and when they all grow in life and function organically, the Body of Christ will be built up.
[39]  CHAPTER FOUR A WORD OF FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATION Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; 4:16; John 21:15-17
[40]  In this message I hope to give a word of fellowship and exhortation.
[41]  After much prayer and seeking before the Lord, I feel that the Lord s recovery both in the East as well as in the West has arrived at a stage where we need to look for a fresh revival.
[42]  Particularly here in Taiwan, the elders of the churches and the co-workers should pick up the burden to seek a fresh revival.
[43]  Although the words of this message will be short, I hope that the elders taking the lead in all the churches, together with all the helping co-workers, will practice this new revival, that the Lord Jesus may have a fresh rising within us every day.
[44]  The more we behold Him, the more we reflect the glory of the Lord and the more we are transformed into the image of the Lord from one stage of glory to another.
[45]  In Ephesians 4:12 the perfecting of the saints is primarily a matter of feeding.
[46]  Only with the proper feeding can there be the proper perfecting, and only then can the saints be equipped and perfected.
[47]  If the elders and co-workers would love the saints like a mother who loves her child and would render a loving, willing service to them, feeding them mouth-to-mouth and teaching them face-to-face, then when the saints are perfected, they will be just like the co-workers and elders; every one of them will be able to do the work that the co-workers and elders do.
