<h2 class=head2>Rejecting Ourselves to Live by Christ</h2><p>We must learn always not to live by ourselves, to reject ourselves, to deny ourselves, because within us is the living One, the Triune God. He was incarnated to be a man and lived on this earth as a man. He passed through human life on the earth and suffered many things. He died on the cross, was resurrected, and as a man was brought into God Himself. This wonderful One today is in us as our life. Therefore, we must learn to live by this living One, not by ourselves or by any teaching or doctrine. What we need is not mere teaching but the real knowledge of a living person, Christ, the Triune God, who lives in us today as our life. We must know how to reject ourselves in order to live by this living One, not according to teaching or regulation but according to the inner anointing.<h2 class=head2>Acting with Authority in the Body</h2><p>Then, we must also realize that we are members of the Body, which has been authorized, anointed, and inaugurated by Christ the Head with all His attainments and obtainments. Since we are members of this Body, we can stand in the position of the Body, for the Body, and with the Body for whatever we need. By praying, we can claim for our experience whatever has been accomplished on the Body.<p>We should not care for what the manifestation of the Spirit upon us will be. Instead, we will simply have authority and power. Then we will not speak things in a vain way with empty words. When we speak, we speak with authority. We will work and do things with authority, not by ourselves but by the One in the heavens. In this sense, we will be like policemen who act with the backing of their government. Those that oppose us will find themselves in trouble, because we do things not by ourselves but by our “uniform,” our authority. This is the real significance of the experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.<p>If we are clear about this matter, we will change our way of prayer. We will pray, “Lord, here we are as representatives of Your Body. We are doing things here not on our own but by Your authority. Therefore, You must bring people to us.” We must pray in this way and claim by faith. We may compare our bold speaking to that of a policeman; a policeman speaks with authority, and others must obey him. We must exercise the faith that comes from our vision. We see the vision that the Body has been inaugurated with authority on the day of Pentecost, and we are the members of this Body, living and acting in the Body, for the Body, and with the Body. We do not do things by or for ourselves. In this way we have authority and power.<p>The book of Acts is the record of a group of people who are regenerated by the Triune God and inaugurated with authority by the Triune God. These people have the Triune God within them as their life and upon them as their authority and power. They act in this way and live by the life within. This is the basic thought of the book of Acts. The situation in Christianity today, however, is full of darkness, and there is little impact and authority. The believers mentioned in Acts moved and worked with authority and power, not as many do today.<p>We must realize the significance of the Lord’s resurrection and ascension, including both the breathing of His breath into us on the day of resurrection and the rushing of the violent wind on the day of Pentecost. Now we have the breath within us and the rushing wind upon us. We have the Triune God as our life within and the very same Triune God as our authority without. As such, we are the church. This is the critical transition in the book of Acts.<h2 class=head2>Praying with Authority in an Aggressive Way</h2><p>We must stand in the position revealed in the Acts, and we must pray, even with fasting. Many times troubles have come to me, and I have prayed in a simple way, “Lord, You must come in to vindicate the situation. You must come in to interfere.” At these times, the Lord did come in. We all can tell the Lord, “Lord, we are not here for ourselves. We are here for You. We are here acting not on our own but as Your Body. You must honor this and do something for Your Body.” We need to deal with the Lord in this way. We must be the real Jacobs and not let Him go (Gen. 32:24-26). It is difficult for nice people to fight a battle. In order to fight the battle, we must pray in an aggressive way. Then we will see something happen.<p>The Triune God is within us as our life and upon us as our authority. If we read the book of Acts again from this point of view we will see this more clearly. This must be our experience. Today this very Jesus, in whom is all that the Triune God has and has obtained, is within us as our life, and this very enthroned One is upon us as our authority. If we live by Him and for Him, we will be different persons, and the church where we are will be different.
