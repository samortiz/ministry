   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE UNIVERSAL VINE AS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD, AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BELIEVERS AS BRANCHES IN THE VINE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN AN ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first law of the increase of the church is that Christ and the church are a universal vine as the organism of the Triune God, and the believers, as the branches of this vine, are in an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abiding in the Son and</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being One Spirit with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to Participate in His Position and Authority</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the believers are branches, we abide in the Son and are one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 , thereby participating in His position and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We participate in the Lord s position and authority in His death, resurrection, and ascension because we are one with Him Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we can go out in His name to disciple the people in the world, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abiding in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>to Receive the Father s Nurturing</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and to Enjoy the Riches of His Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By abiding in the Son, we receive the Father s nurturing, because the Father is the husbandman, the cultivator of the vine John 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By abiding in the Son, we are able to receive the Father s nurturing and to enjoy the riches of the Father s divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 , that is, to enjoy all the riches of God Col 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abiding in the Son to Experience</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Spirit of Life as the Realization of the Son and the Life Essence of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By abiding in the Son, we experience the Spirit as the realization of the Son in us John 14:17, 19; 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This Spirit of life also becomes our life essence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though we are human, the Spirit becomes our life essence when we abide in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The increase and spread of the church is related to the law of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not Being Miraculous in Nature</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law of fruit-bearing does not involve miracles; this can be seen from the fact that fruit is not produced by miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is useless to fast in the hope that a vine would bear grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither should we think that a small group can bear fruit miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gaining fruit in this way rarely happens; miracles are not a reliable method.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There were miracles in Acts, but these miracles were related to outward confirmation, not to the producing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to gain fruit, we must pay attention to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being according to the Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fruit-bearing is not miraculous in nature; rather, it is according to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to experience the law of life, we must fulfill certain requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abiding in the Lord as Branches</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>to Absorb His Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to abide in the Lord and absorb His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the branches of a tree are attached to a tree in order to receive its life supply, we must abide in the Lord continually and absorb the riches of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Abiding in the Lord to Absorb the Supply</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>of God the Father and the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also need to abide in the Lord and absorb the supply of God the Father and the supply of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we fellowship with the Lord, we will definitely have a supply from the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The supply of the Father is like soil that provides nutrients, and the supply of the Spirit is like rain that waters and refreshes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Trees receive a supply of nutrients from the soil and a supply of water from the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Abiding in the Lord to Absorb the Supply</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>of God and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Further, we also need to abide in the Lord and absorb God as our light and the Spirit as our air.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we abide in the Lord, we have these two kinds of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Abiding in the Lord and Living in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>for Nurturing and Protection</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally, we need to abide in the Lord and live in the church as the garden of God so that we can be nurtured and protected.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Bearing New Fruit Each Month</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we abide in the Lord, we will surely bear new fruit each month.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a principle in the Bible cf.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we all accept the Lord s leading and set up a schedule, our number will triple by the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is equal to a two hundred percent rate of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am very hopeful, because the condition of the church has matured, and the social environment in Taiwan is very receptive to the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The inward condition of the church is good, and the outward social situation is also good.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These two factors will help us gain a twofold reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I also hope that the elders will pay attention to the need related to the purchase of land and the building of a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A meeting hall is not a requirement, but a large meeting hall can help us gain better results.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A large hall is like a university, a medium-sized hall is like a high school, and a small hall is like an elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church in Taipei has only small and medium-sized halls but not a large hall; therefore, this is a need.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Otherwise, even though we continually beget those who can be nurtured in the homes, there will be no university to teach and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>With a large meeting hall, we can gather for many different meetings, either once a week, once a month, once every three months, or even once every five months.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The emphasis of these messages on the increase and spread of the church is not on doctrines or even statistics; rather, the intention is to bring us into the reality of the increase and spread corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is very much related to the Lord s further advance among us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope that we all would pray concerning this.</S>
