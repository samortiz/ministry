   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ETERNAL SPIRIT OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT OF ENVY Scripture Reading: Heb 1:2; 2:3-4; 3:7-8a; 6:4; 9:8, 14; 10:15, 29; John 1:14, 17; 3:16; 1 Cor 1:2, 9; 15:45; 2 Cor 13:14; Col 1:12; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>25; James 4:5 THE SUPERIORITY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see in the book of Hebrews the New Testament economy to dispense a wonderful Person into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament is not composed of a number of books concerning doctrine, but it is a complete revelation of a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the apostles time, however, most of the believers were Jews who came out of Judaism, a strong, high, and profound religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Jewish religion had the highest doctrine and all of their basic doctrine was real.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This religion was structured mainly of five crucial items: God, the angels, Moses who gave the law , Aaron the high priest , and the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No other religion has such crucial items, but all these items are merely doctrines in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Living God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even at the time of the Lord Jesus, the Jewish leaders had all these five items as doctrine, yet they did not have the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Hebrews Paul compared this wonderful Person, the Triune God Himself, with all the five crucial items of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Jews had God in doctrine but not in Person Heb 1:2, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Hebrews Paul presented, not the study of God or the doctrine of God, but God Himself, the Person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He presented theos, not theology.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Superior to the Angels</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This wonderful Person, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who is God Himself, the Triune God, embodied in a man is much superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can angels who are merely servants to God Heb 1:7 and even servants to God s people Heb 1:14 compare with such a wonderful Person?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Superior to Moses</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This One is also much superior to Moses Heb 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was a faithful servant in the house of God, but this wonderful Person is the Master of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moses brought in the law, but this wonderful One, whose riches are unsearchable Eph 3:8 , brings in grace and reality John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Superior to Aaron</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This wonderful One is also much superior to Aaron Heb 4:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Aaron lived and died, but this One, as the great High Priest surpassing the heavens, lived, died, and lives again forever; He is living forever to intercede for us Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Aaron was a high priest serving according to the ordinances of the law, but this One is the High Priest, who passed through the heavens, ministering by the endless life Heb 7:3, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Mediator of a Superior Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, this wonderful One has enacted the new covenant, which is much better than the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The old covenant was of dead letters, but the new covenant is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This One is also the Mediator, the Executor, of the better covenant of life Heb 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hebrews 2:3-4 tells us that God bore witness to so great a salvation by distributions of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The distributions of the Holy Spirit are the things including the Spirit Himself, which the Holy Spirit distributes to those who receive salvation by believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This also includes the imparting of the divine life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of us who have believed in the Lord Jesus must realize that the divine life has been distributed into our being with the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the first basic distribution of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit Himself is a distribution into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A Person has been distributed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we were saved, it seemed that One was always moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We did not have this kind of experience before being saved, but after we were saved we had this sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The greatest distribution into our being is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A wonderful Person has been distributed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In our experience there are also other distributions of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times while I am speaking, there is a distribution going on to give me the instant feeling, the instant enlightenment, the instant utterance, and the instant illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are the distributions of the Spirit to confirm the great salvation we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book of Hebrews opens with the speaking of the Son but continues with the distributions of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Son in chapter one is the Spirit in chapter two.</S>
