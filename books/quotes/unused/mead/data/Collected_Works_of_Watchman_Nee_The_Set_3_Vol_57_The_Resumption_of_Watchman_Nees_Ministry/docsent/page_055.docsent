   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Today</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Having Arrived at God's Goal Yet</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What the churches are practicing today in all the localities is a big failure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The co-workers do not have the adequate understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the bread-breaking meeting, we can say that everyone opens his mouth and prays.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the matter of service, we have not seen everyone serving.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have every brother and sister becoming a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the meetings the only thing that everyone can do is sing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is true that the priests sang in the Holy Place, but that was not the only service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today not everyone is serving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only when the priests and the people become one entity is there the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our service today is only the service of three or five people; it is not the service of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other than the "Levites,'' no one else is qualified to serve any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet God's desire is that the whole Body would serve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Way Today Being for the Whole Body to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only do you have nothing to boast of; you have to confess your sin instead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Personal godliness does nothing to build up the church; it actually tears down the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way of the work, the proper way, is to help every brother and sister do the work himself or herself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a matter of much service or little service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a matter of everyone serving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unless we are all serving together, we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is our way today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has to be the church that is working.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It has to be the church that is preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It has to be the church that is saving souls.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter how well we work, as long as we are replacing others, we are one of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With us there is only the ministry; there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if we are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if we do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever we do, we are failures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Whole Body Taking the Gospel as Our Center</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gospel is our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything else is done on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to take the gospel as our center.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth; the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real preaching of the gospel is done by the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The preaching of the gospel by three or five cannot be considered the real preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need the whole Body, that is, everyone, to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the brothers and sisters see that the church is a Body, they will no longer be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The most blessed and happy thing is to give oneself to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only when our money is with God will we be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people may have too many material riches with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why they are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they would lose some of what they have, their joy would increase.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The matter is not whether one's occupation is high or low.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The matter concerns what we are here for.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some work in their jobs, while others take care of their families at home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But everyone has to give his all for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I heard what Brother Witness Lee has done in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I also heard what he has done in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these works are good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I would add one thing: In the matter of consecration, everyone must have a part.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone has to hand himself over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By that time, as soon as a person is saved, he will hand himself over and be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why do we baptize people?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the meaning of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Baptism means that we come under the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he no longer belongs to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, he belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Baptism separates a person from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need the "handing over'' as the make-up lesson only because the baptism of many people was not up to the standard at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the future, when we preach the gospel, there will be no need to put up big advertisements or propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Men will hear and see the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They will see that everyone is serving.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there are three thousand people, all three thousand will be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone will be working, and everyone will be serving, but no one will be murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Realizing the Glory and Grace of Serving God</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers, how should we answer God's call?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the old days men tried to usurp the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today the priesthood is in our hands already.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Are we going to cast it aside?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What the Israelites lost was lost; they could no longer recover it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Are we going to make the service of God something cheap in our hands?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For some, service to God is a matter of doing God a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But we have to see that for God to allow us to serve Him is His grace and favor on us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When a man does not see the glory of serving the Lord, he calculates everything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But when he sees the glory of serving Him, he will kneel before God to beg for this service.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Recently, the newspaper said that China Textile Corporation is issuing new shares.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the stock market is up, everyone wants to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As long as they have money, they put it into the market.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do we see the glory of serving God today?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Those who see it will surely give their all for it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who are standing far off do not know God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who know God's grace and know themselves do not count the cost...</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Note: At this juncture, before the above words were finished, some brothers broke down in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Sister Pearl Wang also broke down in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brother Witness Lee's concluding prayer: It is not that we can give You much.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is what You want of us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>May You grant us a more absolute, thorough, and serious service.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Amen.</S>
