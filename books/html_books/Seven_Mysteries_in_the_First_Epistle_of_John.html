He wrote one Gospel, three Epistles, and the book of Revelation. The New Testament writings as a whole can be similarly categorized: the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. It is noteworthy that each of these three sections concludes with one of John&#8217;s writings. The final word, even in conversation, is generally the decisive word. Thus, in the writings of John we have the final word of the whole revelation of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S MEANS AND GOD&#8217;S GOAL</h2><p>The Gospel of John deals with the matter of life and building. Life is wonderful and profound, but it is not the goal. It is the way to reach the goal, God&#8217;s building.<p>The first two chapters of the Bible deal with creation. The last two chapters picture for us the holy city, New Jerusalem. This city is a building. By considering the beginning and the ending, we can see that the goal of God&#8217;s creation is a building. In creation God called things not being as being that He might have the materials for His building.<p>In between the beginning and the ending the theme is life. You recall that on the final day of creation God created man (Gen. 1:27, 31). God was pleased with everything He had made, and He blessed man. In 2:8 we are told that God planted a garden in which He put the man whom He had formed. This garden was part of God&#8217;s creation; as yet, no city had been built. In the midst of this garden, among many other trees, there was the tree of life. What the fruit of this tree looked like we do not know. We can identify a peach from a peach tree, but to know what life is is not easy. Nonetheless, we know that we have life; describing it may be difficult, but in our experience we know what it is. Let us rejoice that there is the tree of life, even though we cannot precisely define what life is.<h2 class=head1>LIFE</h2><p>Even our human life is too mysterious to be defined. A table has no life, but a man does. How to explain this mysterious element we do not know. The life referred to in the tree of life is far more mysterious than human life. As most of us know, in Greek there are three different terms for life. The physical life is called bios. In addition we have a psuche, a psychological life. The third kind of life is called zoe, the life of the tree of life.<p>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; The Greek word for life used here is zoe. In the next verse He said, &#8220;The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; Life here is psuche. The Lord Jesus laid down His psuche life to accomplish redemption for us and thus to make the eternal zoe life available to us. Nothing can destroy the zoe life. Jesus as a human being died on the cross, laying down His human psychological life in our stead, in order to impart to us the zoe life.<p>This life, denoted by zoe, is the divine life; in actuality it is nothing less than God Himself. It is not simply matter, but the very divine Person, the eternal Being. &#8220;For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us&#8221; (1 John 1:2). This very life was looked upon and handled by the apostles (v. 1). From the context it is clear that the life is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In the first verse the life is called the Word of life and in verse 2 &#8220;the life&#8221; and &#8220;that eternal life.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE TREE AND THE RIVER</h2><p>Life, then, is the eternal Being. This divine Person is what lies between God&#8217;s creation in the beginning and God&#8217;s building at the end. This life is the means or procedure through which God will accomplish His purpose. In the New Jerusalem, God&#8217;s eternal goal, the tree of life appears again (Rev. 22:2). It grows on both sides of a flowing river. This vivid picture tells us that even in eternity the tree of life will be the process by which the city is maintained. By the time we reach Revelation 21, the city has been produced, but the keeping element for all eternity will be the flowing supply of this life. God&#8217;s eternal building will be maintained with the very life grown in the flowing river. Even in the New Jerusalem life is not the goal but the process by which the goal is reached and maintained.<p>Even now we are all in that flow! Furthermore, that flow is within us! From the day we accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior, there has been something flowing within us. Even in coming to a meeting, we are brought by a flow, not by ourselves. This river within is the source of our strength and joy. The flow within us, and the flow we are in, indicates that we are all in the process of God&#8217;s building. Whether we love the Lord or are careless, sooner or later we shall all be processed into the New Jerusalem. When we get there, some of us may be surprised that we ever made it. We may wonder how we managed to arrive, along with so many others whose love for the Lord seemed so much stronger than ours. We may be assured that the flow we are in is not at a standstill! It is a process, which will some day take us all to the New Jerusalem.<p>This flow began in Genesis 2, where we are told that &#8220;a river went out of Eden to water the garden&#8221; where the tree of life was. A river is mentioned again in Psalm 36:8: &#8220;Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.&#8221; In Ezekiel 47 the river again appears. When we come to John 7:38, the one river has become rivers. &#8220;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221; At the end of the Bible the river is still flowing.<h2 class=head1>THE FLOW OF THE RIVER</h2><p>All of us are in this flowing river. Even if we want to sidestep it, we have been caught and have no way out. We have been ensnared by the hunter! We are the fish with the hook in our mouth! Gospel preachers are hunters. The Lord told Peter he would be a fisher of men (Matt. 4:19). Surely that word was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, when the fisherman caught three thousand fish (Acts 2:41)! I got caught on that hook fifty years ago. In spite of struggling my hardest to get free, I only became more and more trapped. This is the story of all of us. Even if we backslide, the hook will only sink in the more deeply. Our final destiny will not be the lake of fire, but the city of water. We shall be in that city of living water.<p>How are we going to get there? There is no plane to take and no transportation charge to pay! We are being carried there in the flow of this river. Every day, with the passage of time, we are being brought closer and closer to that city. Just as an airplane brings us to our destination even while we are sleeping, so we may be unaware that this flow is carrying us nearer and nearer to the New Jerusalem. When we wake up, we shall be there!<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR JOHN&#8217;S EPISTLES</h2><p>Life is the process we are under. This life is fully unfolded to us in the twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John. Why, then, did John still write the three Epistles, an additional seven chapters? Many basic factors are unveiled only in these Epistles and are not mentioned elsewhere.<p>No doubt we all have life, but the process of life does not happen overnight. We are not saved one day and in the New Jerusalem the next. Hundreds of chapters are sandwiched between the first two chapters of the Bible and the last two! Between creation and building many complications arise in the process of life. There are joys and sorrows, songs and lamentations. Thus, after the Gospel of John, we need the Epistles of John.<p>Only here do we have a saying like this: &#8220;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us&#8221; (1 John 1:1-3).<p>The preaching of the gospel, these verses indicate, is the declaration of life as a Person to people. It is not the passing on of doctrine or knowledge, but the proclamation of a Person who is life.<h2 class=head1>FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>The purpose of this declaration is not that its hearers may have life, as is the case with the Gospel of John (John 10:10); rather, it is that they may have fellowship with the apostles, whose fellowship &#8220;is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.&#8221; In this message we are considering the mystery of life. But in 1 John 1:3 we have another mystery, the mystery of fellowship. What does the term fellowship mean? It is not easy to come up with a satisfactory definition. Fellowship is the flowing of the life we have received. Life is a Person, the Son of God. When we receive this life, it begins to flow within us. Like the blood flowing in our veins, it is never at a standstill. All the time we are going about our daily living, the blood keeps circulating. Physical exercise keeps us healthy by further stimulating our circulation. If our circulation stops, we are finished. Fellowship is the scriptural term for circulation. Our eyes are in the &#8220;fellowship,&#8221; as are our shoulders and our feet. All the members of our body are in the fellowship; the blood circulates to all of them.<p>Fellowship is also like the current of electricity. When electricity is in motion, it is called a current. If you check your electrical meter when your appliances are operating, you will see that the current moves when you use the electricity. If you do not use any electricity, there is no flow of the current. The meter has nothing to register. When the appliances are switched on, however, they receive the current of electricity. That current is the fellowship. If you are not &#8220;switched on&#8221; and partaking of the flow of &#8220;electricity,&#8221; you are not in the fellowship. Like an appliance, your functioning results from your participating in the current.<p>The Lord Jesus as the divine Person is life to us. When we receive Him, He comes into us and we are put into Him. This life then circulates as fellowship. The life received issues in fellowship. The apostles declared life &#8220;that ye also may have fellowship.&#8221; Many Christians do not realize that once they are saved, they are in a fellowship. Fellowship is simply the flowing of the divine life within us. When life stands still, it is life; when it flows, it is fellowship.<h2 class=head1>GRACE AND LOVE</h2><p>In the Gospel of John we are told that the incarnated Word dwelt among us, &#8220;full of grace and reality&#8221; (1:14). When we receive this Word who became flesh, we receive grace and truth (reality). &#8220;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace&#8221; (v. 16).<p>In the First Epistle of John, however, the words grace and truth are replaced. Instead of grace, we are told that God is love (4:8). Instead of truth, we are told that God is light (1:5). Suppose we have a pair of chopsticks. One is called grace at the tip and love at the other tip. The other chopstick is called truth at the tip and light at the other tip. When we pick up the chopsticks and look at the tips from which we eat, we see grace and truth. If we look at the other end, however, we shall see love and light. Grace is at one end, the one facing us, and love is at the other end, facing God. The other chopstick has truth on the end facing us, while light is the tip pointed toward God.<p>When God came to us in the Person of the Son, He brought grace and truth. After we receive these, we return to God in the Son and find love and light. The Gospel of John presents us with the issue, grace and truth. His Epistle brings us to the source, where the Father is, and there we find love and light. When we receive the Son, we receive life and enjoy grace and truth. This life flows in us as fellowship, bringing us back to the Father, where we enjoy love and light, the source of grace and truth.<p>We enjoy grace and find it most sweet. But we must go on to love, which is deeper and more hidden. Grace is the expression; its source is love. These two are one. If we enjoy love, grace is included.<h2 class=head1>TRUTH AND LIGHT</h2><p>The same is true of truth and light. At one end, the end of expression, it is truth, which means reality or realization. At the other end, the source, it is light. When we are holding the truth, by implication we are also holding the light. If we go on in the fellowship back to its source, we shall see that there is not only truth or realization, but light as well. To be in the light means that we have the source of truth or reality.<p>The Bible does not say that God or Christ is grace. Nor does it say that God is truth, though it does tell us that Christ is the truth (John 14:6). But that God is love and light 1 John clearly states. We are also told that God is Spirit (John 4:24). Love, light, and Spirit are all common terms, yet how can we explain the difference in their usage here? Spirit refers to God&#8217;s essence; God is Spirit just as a book is paper. That God is love means that God&#8217;s disposition is love.<p>God is love. Even if you beg Him to hate, or tell Him that you do not want His love, He cannot be other than love. That is the way He is.<p>That God is light denotes His function in expressing Himself. Light is what shines and illumines. Without it, we are in darkness, deprived of any positive realization. Once the light comes, however, this shining issues in realization. We can see people, distinguish colors, and identify objects. How do we realize the truth of God? It is by His being light. When He shines in us, we realize Him as reality. Reality comes from the light&#8217;s shining.<p>When we read the Bible, we find the truth. In Romans 6, for instance, we read that our old man has been crucified with Christ that we might be freed from sin. This is the truth, or the reality. Our reading, however, does not bring us the experience. We were taught to reckon that we were dead that we might experience the truth of Romans 6. Reckoning resulted only in our being more alive than before. We felt that our efforts to know and experience this truth were futile.<p>There is another way. If we are in the fellowship and allow that fellowship to bring us into God, there in the source God as light shines over us. Under His shining we have a realization. This is the genuine reality, resulting not from reading the Bible but from being enlightened.<p>Suppose a sinner hears the gospel and believes in the Lord Jesus. The Lord comes into him as a living Person. This newly saved one immediately senses the life flowing within him. His formerly unbearable situation seems to have faded away. The life flowing within sustains and strengthens him, making him feel joyous and free from any problems. This is the experience of grace. Along with it is the realization that the Lord Jesus is real and living. The thought of Jesus fills him with delight. He enjoys what the Lord is to him, and he has the realization of the reality of Jesus.<h2 class=head1>TOUCHING THE SOURCE</h2><p>While we are in this happy condition, we find our prayer spontaneously going out to the Father. &#8220;O Abba Father! You are so good! How I thank You for forgiving my sins! Now You are with me. You are my life.&#8221; We were not intending to address the Father, but there was an inner directing that brought us to Him. As our prayer continues, the sense increases that we are in the Father&#8217;s presence. We wonder if we are in heaven or still on earth. There comes a sense of being sustained by something even finer, deeper, and sweeter than grace.<p>We have touched the source of grace, which is love. The grace which strengthens and upholds us is the expression of that love. Through prayer we have been brought into God. Not only has He entered into us, but we have been brought back into Him through fellowship. Abiding here in God we taste not only grace but love, the root of grace, as well.<p>The New Testament, strictly speaking, nowhere says that this love, which is God Himself, does anything for us. When Paul besought the Lord to take away the thorn in his flesh, the Lord told him, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:7-9). Whatever Paul&#8217;s suffering, grace kept and sustained him. He tells us further how grace operated in him and for him in 1 Corinthians 15:10: &#8220;But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&#8221; Grace is spoken of as accomplishing things on Paul&#8217;s behalf, but we do not find love referred to in this way.<p>Most of us are content to remain in the expression, rather than come to the source. We testify to others how gracious the Lord is to us. We used to get angry with our wife even if she simply looked at us in the wrong way. Now, even if she yells and screams at us, we are still happy and can praise the Lord. What grace He has given us! Yes, this is His grace, but we can go deeper and be brought into God, the source. Here we shall touch love, which is deeper and sweeter than the grace which sustains us.<p>As we are under the shining, God penetrates our very being. We are enjoying not the truth but God Himself as the light shining over us. Here we realize all that God is to us. We are in the hidden place, the secret place of the Most High. Here we are rooted in nothing less than God Himself. God as the source of grace is love to us. God as the source of all realization is light to us. We enjoy Him as the source. Unlike most Christians, who are satisfied with the outward expression as grace and truth, we are at the source enjoying love and light, no longer limited to their external manifestation as grace and truth.<p>This shining occurs within the fellowship, which is the flowing of Christ as life within us. It is this flowing which brings us to the source of grace and of truth. Here God shines whatever He is into us. This brings us the realization. We enjoy God as love, the source of grace. We participate in God as light, the source of truth. This enjoyment and participation is the outcome of the fellowship, that life which is always flowing within us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF FELLOWSHIP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:3, 5-10; 2:1-2; 4:13, 16b</h1><h2 class=head1>A CONTINUATION</h2><p>It is clear from the first verse of 1 John that this Epistle is a continuation of the Gospel of John. &#8220;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life&#8221; are the opening words of the Epistle, dealing, like John&#8217;s Gospel, with the Word which was from the beginning.<p>John is a long book, of twenty-one chapters, comprehensively covering the matter of life. Out of this life there is a mingling of divinity with humanity. Chapters fourteen and fifteen refer to this, where the Lord says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes&#8221; (14:2) and &#8220;If anyone loves Me... We will come to him and make an abode with him&#8221; (v. 23). &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit&#8221; (15:5). The abode means that we become God&#8217;s dwelling and that He becomes ours. This mutual dwelling place is the mingling of the Triune God with all the believers, so that they together form an all-inclusive, corporate entity.<p>In John 17 the Lord prayed for the oneness of all the believers in the Triune God. &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us...I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one&#8221; (vv. 21, 23). Such a oneness is what is typified by the tabernacle (Exo. 26:15-30). There were forty-eight boards all made one by being overlaid with gold. Upon the overlaid gold were golden rings, through which went the golden uniting bars to link all the boards together. Thus the boards became a single entity, the building. The wooden boards signified humanity and the gold overlay, divinity, not only in its nature but also in its glory. This oneness in the tabernacle portrays the mingling of divinity with humanity. The Gospel of John to some extent unfolds this mingling, but a careful reading is needed to see it.<p>First John further continues this very matter by telling us that the life from the beginning, which is the living One, has been declared to all believers &#8220;that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ&#8221; (1:3). The words are simple, but the  significance is profound. There is one fellowship here, not only between the Father and the Son but also with the apostles (&#8220;us&#8221;); all believers (&#8220;ye&#8221;) are to be in this same fellowship. This fellowship is not only vertical, between God and man, but also horizontal, among all believers. What is called fellowship here is a corporate mingling of divinity with humanity.<h2 class=head1>FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>The meaning of the word fellowship has been spoiled. All too often it is applied to social visits, conversations, various charitable or missionary societies, or the supplying of someone&#8217;s financial needs. All these activities are quite commonplace, yet none of them is necessarily what the holy Word means by the term fellowship.<p>Fellowship corresponds to the circulation of the blood in the physical body. It is this circulation which unites all the members with the head and with each other. The body and the head are one because of this circulation. All the hundreds of members in the body are kept in fellowship or oneness with each other by this same circulation. Circulation is not something other than the blood itself. When the blood flows in the blood vessels, there is circulation; when the blood is stationary, there is no circulation. Once the blood flow stops, death and detachment result. The members are no longer related to each other nor to the head.<p>Like circulation, fellowship is the flow of life through all the members of the Body of Christ. It is not our greeting each other and engaging in conversation. It is not our paying someone&#8217;s bills. The church is not a social club or a charitable organization. It is a Body! In this Body flows the divine, eternal life, which is the living Person of God Himself. Apart from this flowing, there is death and detachment.<p>Electric current is another illustration of this flowing of the divine life, which the Bible calls the fellowship. When the electricity in a building is turned on, there is an electric current. Before this, the electricity is present, but not moving because it has not been applied. The electric current supplies electricity to the appliances as soon as the switches are turned on. The overhead lights, for example, are separate and unrelated until the switches are turned on. As soon as the electric current gets into them, there is a unity among them, the current of electricity itself, which brings them into &#8220;fellowship&#8221; with each other.<p>The microphone I am using is in the same &#8220;fellowship&#8221;! It not only fellowships with the lamps, but also with the power plant, the source of its electrical supply. Similarly, while I am speaking, I am also fellowshipping with the third heaven! Do not think that I am being superstitious. Surely it is an obvious fact to say that this microphone is in touch with a far-off power plant, which supplies the electricity for its operation. The fellowship we are in is simply Jesus Christ, the living One, flowing within all of us.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>This fellowship is what brings in the proper church life. We do not necessarily have the church life by merely coming together as believers in Jesus. The church life depends on the believers in the Lord Jesus being in the fellowship. It is not simply that the believers love each other. The church life is the flowing of the living Jesus; it is the fellowship revealed to us in 1 John 1. John nowhere in this Epistle uses the term church, but what he writes about is in actuality the church life. Nowadays the term church is commonplace, but its practicality is not much in evidence. What John writes about the fellowship is simply the church life, even though this term is not found here.<p>We may be in the church, but are we actually in the church life? If we are not in the flowing of the Lord Jesus within us, we are not really in the church life. We are like one of the overhead lights which is not receiving the current of electricity. It is in the building, but it is not receiving the electricity. We may think that as long as we are here, we are in the church life. This is true only positionally; in actuality, we are in the church life only when we are in the flow of the Lord Jesus.<p>Suppose you sit in the meeting, evaluating what I am saying. You have heard some negative criticism, so you pay close attention to my words, trying to figure out if what I say is heretical. As you sit there on guard, thinking you are protecting the church from heresy, you are like one of the lights with no electricity getting through. Or you may sit in the meeting, sure that you are in the church, but fast asleep! While you are sleeping, you are not receiving the heavenly electricity. Practically, you are out of the church life until you wake up and turn the current back on! Or part of the time you are in the meeting you may be in the practical church life, but after some minutes you may be out of the flow and therefore temporarily out of the church life. Perhaps what I am saying sounds extreme, but I want to point out to you that the church life is living and real.<h2 class=head1>IN GOD&#8217;S PRESENCE OR IN HIS ESSENCE?</h2><p>When there is this flowing within us, we are brought not only into God&#8217;s presence but into His very essence. The term &#8220;in&#8221; is used over and over in 1 John. We are in God, and He is in us (2:5, 6, 10, 14, 24, 27, 28; 3:6, 24; 4:4, 12, 13, 15, 16; 5:20). We like to say that we are in God&#8217;s presence, but the word presence is not found once in 1 John. The fellowship brings us not only to God but into Him as well. Consider how great a difference there is between being in God and being in His presence. As I am speaking before you, I am in your presence. We are face to face. For me to be in you, however, is another matter entirely. I cannot get inside you. For us to be in God, on the other hand, is possible, because God today is the Spirit. He is like the air we breathe. We are in the air and can also have air in us. We are in God and He is in us, not by striving but by letting the Lord Jesus flow and keep flowing within us.<p>God Himself, as 1 John tells us, is both love (4:8) and light (1:5). When we are brought into Him, we are brought into love and light in their essence. God&#8217;s reaching out to us is grace and truth, as the Gospel of John tells us (1:14). Now this fellowship brings us into the source of grace and truth, so that we are no longer just superficially experiencing them. Instead of grace coming to us outwardly, we experience God Himself as love. Rather than objectively knowing some aspects of truth, we experience God as light.<h2 class=head1>THE SOURCE OF GRACE</h2><p>Paul also made this distinction between grace and love. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 he wrote of &#8220;the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Gk.). These three are linked to show that they are mingled and practical. Second Corinthians is a book on grace. When Paul was suffering, pricked by a thorn in the flesh, he prayed three times that the Lord would remove it. &#8220;And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221; (12:9). From this experience of Paul&#8217;s we can see that grace is present with us to do something in our behalf. First Corinthians 15:10 also indicates that grace acts for us. &#8220;But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&#8221;<p>To be in the realm where grace does things for us is to be somewhat superficial. If we are brought into the fellowship, that is, into God, we shall find the source of grace, love, which is far sweeter and more intimate. Even on the human level, we have experienced this distinction. Our family may do something to help us when we are in a low situation. At first we may consider that this is their love for us, but actually their doing is only the expression of their love. If we appreciate only their outward doing, without recognizing the love behind it, we are being too superficial toward them. When we realize the love which motivates their doing, our appreciation will be for themselves alone rather than for their kind deeds. The accompanying sense of sweet intimacy indicates that we are appreciating the source of their gracious doing, which is love.<p>Many of us acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s help in difficult circumstances; His supply of strength in our weakness; His intervening in hard places; and the many other evidences of His care for us. What we are appreciating is merely His grace. If we are brought deeper into the inner circulation of the divine life, this fellowship will bring us into God Himself, who is love. We shall turn from our appreciation of what He has done for us to treasure Him as the source of grace. Eventually we lose our interest in having the Lord do things for us. We care only to remain in this love, whether or not there is any outward expression of it.<p>Suppose someone, in order to express his affection for me, buys me a Bible. I am pleased to have such a beautiful leather-covered, gilt-edged edition. I admire it and carry it around to show others what a lovely gift I have received without having paid even a penny for it. My thoughts seldom turn toward the giver; I just enjoy his present. Such is our appreciation of grace rather than of the source of grace.<p>Suppose, for another example, your wife always expects presents from you. You must bring her flowers, buy her a new outfit, and even get her a car for herself. She seems to have little interest in you as a person and no tender feelings of love for you. What kind of wife would that be? How much better it is to have a wife who appreciates you for yourself! Instead of looking for presents, she is content to enjoy your love and satisfied in the assurance that you care for her. You may give her things because you love her, but she does not regard those things as highly as the love which prompted you to buy them.<p>There are perhaps many of us who appreciate what the Lord has done for us and how much He has given us, yet we lack an appreciation of the source of His grace. This lack results from our not being adequately in the fellowship. Once we are in the fellowship, we are brought right into God Himself. We no longer see much of grace; we see the divine Person as the fountain. We no longer have much interest in whether we have this or that good thing; it is enough to have God Himself as love, the source of grace.<h2 class=head1>THE SOURCE OF TRUTH</h2><p>As believers we all have some apprehension of the truth. How many of us, though, are in the light? Light is in God and is God Himself. Until we are brought into God Himself, we may be under the shining of the light, but we are not in the light. To be under the shining of the light is one thing; to be in the light is another. Under the shining we may have the truth, or the realization, but we are not in the light until we are in God Himself.<p>Then every hidden thing will be exposed. From the time we were saved, we have been under the shining, coming to certain realizations and understandings. Some day we shall be willing for this inner fellowship to bring us into God. In Him we shall be in the light, not merely the shining. Most Christians today are far off, even in darkness. Some are under the shining. But very few are in the light. Probably a good number of us have occasionally had experiences in which we were brought into God and recognized that we were in the light.<p>Suppose you get annoyed with another brother. You are not in the light yet, but under the shining you sense that your attitude was poor. You go to that brother and apologize that your attitude earlier was wrong. For you the apology is sufficient; after all, a bad attitude is a common fault, not to be taken all that seriously.<p>Some Christians would not even admit that they were wrong to be annoyed with a brother. It was the brother&#8217;s fault, they would insist. Why did he act that way toward them? He  is the one who needs to say he is sorry; there is nothing for which they need to apologize. Such Christians are fully in darkness.<p>Will you allow the inner fellowship to bring you into God? Then you will be in the light. Under its glare you will tremble. You will realize that it is not only your attitude toward your brother which is to be condemned. You yourself in every part are sinful, fully contaminated, and thoroughly unclean. In the light there is no excuse, no back door, no side exit, no escape. You will weep, repent, and take hours to confess. Your hands may look quite clean now, but if you see them in the light, you will see how full of germs they are.<p>In this fellowship with the Father we have light, and in this light we have fellowship (1 John 1:3, 5, 7). The result of being in the light is the recognition that we are utterly sinful. Every member of our body is sinful. Every relationship with others is sinful. The way we wear our clothes is sinful. Because we are in the old creation, nothing about us is clean; we are polluted and condemned. Everything within us-our feelings, our intentions, our decisions, our concepts, and our ideas-is sinful. As human beings we are full of sin. The reason we do not have this conviction is that we are not in the light. When Isaiah was brought into the glory of God, he said, &#8220;Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips&#8221; (Isa. 6:5). We have some amount of truth, knowing that we should do this and be like that, but such a realization is not light; it is only truth. If we are willing to abide in the fellowship, it will bring us into God. Then we shall be thoroughly exposed by this light from which nothing can be hidden.<h2 class=head1>THE BLOOD</h2><p>It is common among us to say that we apply the blood to our situation. This is not what 1 John 1 says about the blood, however. &#8220;If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin&#8221; (v. 7). To say that we apply the blood is an indication that we are not in the light, but rather avoiding it. Light takes away all our cover-ups. It penetrates every hiding place. It so exposes us that we cry out, &#8220;Woe is me! I am unclean!&#8221; At that very moment the blood cleanses. This verse clearly tells us that if we are in the light, the blood follows the light to cleanse us. There is no requirement on our part to apply the blood. To apply the blood means that we have the realization that we are sinful but have not yet had our sins exposed in the light. Whatever the light exposes, the blood cleanses. Praise the Lord for His provision.<p>Yes, the blood cleanses, but all too often the weak ones, after the exposing, keep right on condemning themselves. We Christians are peculiar! Before we are brought into the light, we will not admit that we are sinful; yet once the blood has cleansed us, we will not believe that we are cleansed. We seem to like being in a state of condemnation!<h2 class=head1>AN ADVOCATE AND THE PROPITIATION</h2><p>Because of this tendency of ours to remain under condemnation, 1 John 2 begins by telling us that if we sin, &#8220;we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world&#8221; (vv. 1-2). Christ is our Advocate, taking care of our case with the Father. He is also our propitiation, meaning that He has settled our problem with sin. Whatever concern we have, He has already made provision for. Yes, our sin does cause a problem between God and us. But we must realize that the Lord Jesus, as the propitiation for our sins, has already settled this problem. Based upon His propitiatory work, He is now our heavenly Attorney, presenting our case in the heavenly court. We may be assured that when we are exposed by the light, the blood cleanses us. The very One who made propitiation for our sins is now the Advocate taking care of our case.<p>Not only does the blood maintain our fellowship; besides the blood, we have the Advocate and the propitiation. God is righteous and holy. We are both sinful and unholy. When we come into the light, we are exposed, but right away the blood cleanses us. This we find hard to believe. Thus, the Apostle John tells us that we have an Advocate with the heavenly Judge. This Advocate has already settled our case. As our propitiation, He paid our debt, met our obligations, and at His own expense took care of whatever was outstanding against us. There is therefore no longer any problem between the Judge and us. The word advocate is the same word in Greek as that translated Comforter in John 14:16; 15:26; and 16:7. The Spirit of reality is the Comforter within us, while the Lord Jesus is the Attorney in the heavenly court, handling our case upon the basis of His own propitiatory work. We must not be bothered, therefore, by the exposing.<p>Satan is subtle. When we pray, even with fasting, he would always seek to keep a veil over us. Eventually, of course, he is frustrated, for whenever the heart &#8220;shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:16). Then we see how evil and contaminated we are. When the light exposes our true condition, there is no need to apply the blood. It is right there to cleanse us. But Satan&#8217;s strategy is to keep condemning us, telling us how unclean we are. Because we lack the assurance that the blood has cleansed us, the Apostle goes on to remind us that Jesus Christ the righteous is our Attorney and our propitiation. We must not be upset by the exposure of our evil condition; it has already been taken care of by Him. It is therefore possible for us to go on in the light.<p>Notice that &#8220;he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us&#8221; (1 John 1:9). John did not say that God is merciful and kind. We are inclined to beg for mercy when we sin, but it is just for God to forgive us. Christ has made propitiation. God can therefore righteously forgive us, not out of mercy or kindness but because He is just. He has given us the good news; now He must keep His word. Otherwise He would not be faithful. He therefore justly forgives us because of Christ&#8217;s propitiation and faithfully forgives us because of His own spoken word.<p>The Apostle John&#8217;s writings appear simple, but that cannot be said of these two chapters, where he speaks of the blood&#8217;s cleansing, the Advocate with the Father, and the propitiation for our sins. These terms are probably not all that clear to you, but in any case I do want to assure you that if you are willing to abide in the fellowship, it will surely bring you into God, who is light. Here you will be fully exposed.<h2 class=head1>GROWTH IN LIFE</h2><p>Without this thorough exposure, there can be little growth in life. Once we have been exposed and cleansed and have the assurance that God&#8217;s claims against us have been satisfied by Christ, our growth in life will spurt forward. Why is it that so many of us seem to have come to a standstill as regards our growth in life? This lack of progress results from our not being in the light, even while we have the truth. We may mentally perceive that we are wrong or sinful, but until we are in the light that knowledge or conviction is at best superficial. In the light we shall have the deep, deep realization that every part of our being is sinful and that even what we consider holy is still sin. This exposing is for the cleansing of the blood. These two, the exposing and the cleansing, are for the growth in life.<p>Satan attempts to thwart our enjoying the growth in life by attacking our conscience with self-condemnation. We must be at peace, assured that in spite of our sinfulness, the Lord Jesus has made propitiation for us and is now our Advocate in the heavenly court. In spite of our sinfulness, we will not be distracted from going on, because this Attorney fully takes care of our case. Propitiation, unlike redemption, is not concerned with bringing us back to God. Propitiation brings our enlightened conscience peace by answering God&#8217;s case against us. Regardless of how much is exposed, our conscience is not troubled. We can advance rapidly in the growth in life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF ABIDING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:5-6, 24, 27-28; 3:6a, 24; 4:4, 12b-13, 15-16; 5:20; John 14:17, 20; 15:4a; 17:21</h1><p>If we were totally unfamiliar with the Bible and its teachings, and someone came and said to us, &#8220;I am in God, and God is in me,&#8221; we would probably think he was a mental case. How can a man be in God and God in him? Nowadays, however, we are quite familiar with expressions like, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you&#8221; (John 15:4). We do not stop to consider what a mystery it is that God, the Person Himself, can actually abide in us and we in Him.<p>Who is God? Where is He? How can He possibly abide in us? It is not merely His power or His love which abides in us, but God Himself. It is easy to see that we are now abiding in this building or that we are abiding in our physical body. But a God who cannot be seen or touched or sensed-is it not sheer superstition to claim that we are now in Him and that at the same time He is in us? To the unbelievers this surely does seem superstitious; to us, however, it is a wonderful fact, which the Bible declares and which we also experience.<h2 class=head1>THE FIRST MENTION OF ABIDING</h2><p>Prior to John 14, the Bible never tells us that man abides in God and that God abides in man. In Genesis we read of Abraham and Jacob, who eventually became intimate with God, yet there is no mention of their abiding in Him. In Exodus there is Moses, who stayed in God&#8217;s presence for forty days and was so infused that his face shone with God&#8217;s glory; nonetheless, there is no record that Moses was abiding in God and that God was abiding in him.<p>If we continue through the Old Testament, we still cannot find a verse indicating that God and man can abide in each other. Even in the Psalms, the most intimate book of the Old Testament, the psalmists were in the temple, beholding God&#8217;s beauty and enjoying the fatness of His house (Psa. 27:4; 36:8), but they were not abiding in God. (Although Psalm 90:1 says &#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations,&#8221; this is different from the abiding in the Lord which is revealed in the New Testament.) Even the prophet Daniel, who was so close to God, makes no mention of actually abiding in Him.<p>Thus it is throughout the rest of the Old Testament, and right on into the New. Matthew is a wonderful book, but there is no record of man&#8217;s abiding in God or of God&#8217;s abiding in man. Nor do we find this in Mark, Luke, or the first thirteen chapters of John either.<p>Hallelujah for John 14! &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be&#8221; (vv. 2-3). When the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Where I am,&#8221; what did He mean? The traditional Christian answer is, &#8220;In heaven.&#8221; If we read on in this very chapter, however, verses 10 and 11 tell us clearly, &#8220;I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me.&#8221; Then the Lord went on to explain to the disciples that they themselves could not yet be in the Father, that first the way had to be cut to give them the standing to be in God. Christ Himself would accomplish the removal of such obstacles as sins, sin, the old nature, the self, Satan, and the world. By His death on the cross, He paved the way for them to be in the divine Person. He removed all the obstacles and terminated all the frustrations. In verse 20 He said, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; He was telling the disciples that on the day of resurrection, after He had accomplished the death of the cross, they would be with Him in the Father. Where He was, there they would be also.<p>Who is in whom? &#8220;I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in You.&#8221; What we have here is a wonderful mingling of divinity with humanity. We are in God and God is in us.<p>John 15 is a continuation of the thought in chapter fourteen. Once we are brought into God, we must abide in Him and He in us (v. 4). We are in the Son, and He is in us. Our need now is to stay there. The King James Version translates the word for abide five different ways: abide (14:16; 15:4-7, 10); dwell (14:10, 17); being present (14:25); continue (15:9); remain (15:11, 16). The use of so many different words to translate one Greek word indicates how rich the meaning is. Now that we are in Christ, we must stay there; remain in Him; dwell in Him; settle down in Him; continue there.<p>In 1 John only twice does it say that we are in the Lord (2:5; 5:20). Most of the Epistle is concerned with abiding. With the Gospel of John we have already been put into Christ; thus, what 1 John is emphasizing is our need to remain where we have been put. We are to abide, not in the Word, nor His love, nor His power, nor His goodness, but in Himself. Do not think this is unimportant. The Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;As you, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&#8221; (John 17:21). To be in the Triune God is too marvelous for words.<h2 class=head1>IN CHRIST</h2><p>Over and over again, beginning with the Acts, the little word &#8220;in&#8221; is used to describe our relationship with the Lord. &#8220;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus....But of him are ye in Christ Jesus&#8221; (Rom. 8:1; 1 Cor. 1:30). In Romans we repeatedly find the phrase &#8220;in Christ.&#8221; In the short book of Ephesians consider how many times it says &#8220;in Him.&#8221; To be in Him is to be in a wonderful place!<p>We have been transferred. Yes, I have been transferred from China to America. But that transfer has little significance. What matters far more is that I have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ! We are not waiting to go to heaven. We have already been transferred (Col. 1:13). We were born in Adam, but now we are in Christ. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>SEEING THE FACT</h2><p>The Bible itself does not really tell us how to abide in Christ. Why is this? It is because, as soon as we see that we are in Christ, we are abiding. To see that we are in is to abide. To see the vision is to abide in the fact. We may doctrinally declare that we are in Christ, but to truly see is another matter. Even in preparing for this message, I went over all the verses listed at the beginning to see if there is any indication of the way to abide given in them. There is none. There is the fact of abiding, but not the way to abide. &#8220;Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit&#8221; (1 John 4:13). We are told how it is that we know we are in Him, but not how to abide in Him. No way is given us, because the real abiding is the seeing of the fact.<h2 class=head1>HOW MADE POSSIBLE</h2><p>That we can abide in the Triune God and have Him abide in us is a tremendous fact. There was much to be accomplished before it could be realized. God was holy, righteous, and full of glory. He could not enter into man. There was the need for incarnation to bring God into the human essence. There was the need for the crucifixion to terminate the old, fallen creation. There had to be redemption to bring back God&#8217;s chosen people. There had to be propitiation to appease the problem between God and man. There was the need of resurrection to bring the redeemed creation into the divine situation.<p>All this has now been accomplished. The Word became flesh (John 1:14). This is the incarnation. As flesh He was the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for us and to remove our sins. Then in resurrection, as the last Adam, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). As the Spirit He imparts Himself into us as life.<h2 class=head1>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2><p>Today our God is not merely God. He has also a human nature. In humanity He has passed through death and resurrection, bringing His redeemed and uplifted humanity with Him into resurrection. This God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit, is the very One who is in us. He, as the Father, Son, and Spirit, indwells us. Many Christians stumble over this, because they have been taught to consider the Trinity as composed of three separate and distinct Persons.<p>For seven and a half years I myself met with the Brethren and absorbed their teachings. I was taught that prayer should be addressed only to the Father. If I heard people pray to the Holy Spirit or to the Lord Jesus, I thought it was wrong. In my prayers I was careful to address the Father in the name of the Son and through the power of the Holy Spirit. For a time I was happy praying this way, because it fitted my doctrinal concept. But gradually I began to feel that the One I was addressing in prayer was not far off in heaven but right inside me. He was not only the Father, but also the Son. I would find myself talking to the Lord within. Eventually I acknowledged that this doctrine was too confining for God to fit into!<p>The Three of the Trinity are one. Yes, there is the matter of Father, Son, and Spirit in the Bible. God is triune in order to dispense Himself into man. Once He is in man, however, the Three are one. The Father is in the Son. The Son has become the Spirit. God reaches man as the Spirit. Yet when the Spirit reaches us, the Son is there. When the Son is there, we have also the Father.<p>When we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; the Spirit comes. This is because the Spirit is the Person of the Lord Jesus. Jesus is the name or the title; the Spirit is His Person. If we follow the traditional teachings of the Trinity, we shall be confused. I am not trying to make a doctrinal point. What I want to do is impress you that our God today is not merely the Creator. He is not only the Father as the source, nor only the Son as the course. He is also the Spirit as the flow to reach us. The God who reaches us does so not as the Father nor as the Son, but as the Spirit. In this all-inclusive Spirit we have the Son and the Father.<p>Because He is Spirit, it is easy for Him to enter into us and for us to be in Him. It is as easy as abiding in the air and having the air abide in us. He is the heavenly pneuma (Gk., spirit, breath). John&#8217;s Gospel presents Christ first as the Word who became flesh, then as the Lamb of God who took away our sins. Finally in 20:22 He is the holy breath. He breathed into the disciples and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Pneuma.&#8221;<p>Call on Him! This wonderful Spirit will reach you and enter into you. You will be in Him, and He will be in you. You will be in Him, not in His power or attributes or influence, but in His very Person. The almighty God, the Creator, the Father as the source, the Son as the Redeemer, the Spirit as the transmission-this divine Person enters into you, and you are in Him!<h2 class=head1>ABIDING</h2><p>If you see this, you will stay here forever! You are now, right now, in the Triune God Himself! You need to have a proper regard for who you are. As one who is in the Triune God and who has the Triune God in you, how can you talk disparagingly of others? How can you be so low as to steal? You are above the angels. How could you stoop to sin? What has this world to offer you? This one fact will uplift you far above all.<p>To see that you are in the Triune God and that He is in you is to abide. This seeing is the abiding. &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you&#8221; (John 15:4). What a mystery! What love is this! It is greater than grace. Abide in Him!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF THE ANOINTING</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:24b; 4:13; 2:18-27; Exo. 30:23-31</h1><p>&#8220;But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him&#8221; (1 John 2:27).<p>The anointing is the fourth mystery in 1 John that we shall consider. The previous messages have dealt with life, fellowship, and abiding. We who have been born of God now have eternal life, are in the fellowship, and abide in God. Our understanding of these profound matters, however, is quite general. When we say that we abide in God and He abides in us, our concept of what &#8220;God&#8221; means and what &#8220;abiding&#8221; means may be somewhat vague. As the Apostle John was writing of these matters, however, he abruptly brought up another subject, which makes the application quite clear.<h2 class=head1>A SEPARATING LINE</h2><p>He wrote: &#8220;Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things&#8221; (2:18-20, Gk.).<p>Antichrists have appeared; they were with the church and have left. They might still call themselves Christians, but they are in another category. What is it that makes the distinction between them and us? The boundary line that separates their sphere from ours is the anointing.<p>The other &#8220;Christians&#8221; lack the anointing. In spite of holding the name of Christ, they are in fact antichrist. Even today there are many, like the modernists, who call themselves Christians, yet they are against Christ. For more than nineteen centuries the anointing has been the line of demarcation between these two kinds of Christians. Both kinds claim to believe in God and to worship Him, yet only one has the anointing.<h2 class=head1>A STRANGE TERM</h2><p>What is the anointing? It is strange that the apostle here used a verbal noun. He might have said ointment, a noun denoting an oil with various ingredients added. Then we would have known that he was referring to a substance. Why did John use the -ing form of the verb anoint? Some Christians are not familiar even with this term. In the King James Version the same Greek word is translated unction in 1 John 2:20 and anointing in verse 27. Anointing is the better translation, since the Greek word is the noun form of anoint.<p>To understand the anointing, we must comprehend the process the Triune God underwent in order to establish His relationship with us.<h2 class=head1>A SEED SOWN</h2><p>The first step in that process is the incarnation, God becoming a man. Even today history has not adequately defined who Jesus is. He is God and man, mingled together as one entity. This God-man lived on the earth thirty-three and a half years. The very God who created the heavens and the earth lived in a carpenter&#8217;s home in a man by the name of Jesus! This is the second step, His human living. The third step is the crucifixion, a form of death used in the Roman Empire for criminals. By this means He entered into death, but after three days He came forth in resurrection.<p>In resurrection He was glorified. During His earthly life He was like a seed without &#8220;form nor comeliness,&#8221; with &#8220;no beauty that we should desire him&#8221; (Isa. 53:2). By death He was sown into the earth. Then He sprouted and grew in resurrection. When the plant produces the blossom, that blossom is the seed glorified. The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat, waiting to fall into the ground and die so that He could grow up into many grains (John 12:24). On the day of resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples in a glorified form, His resurrected body. The flower seed is a natural body, but the blossom is a resurrected one (cf. 1 Cor. 15:42-45). The Lord Jesus is now in resurrection in the form of the Spirit.<p>Now that God has gone through all this process, He is no longer merely God the Creator with divinity. Humanity has been added to Him. The essence of His incarnation and human living, the effectiveness of His death, and the resurrection itself are all now included in Him. Jesus Christ today is not merely God. He is God plus humanity, incarnation, human living, the crucifixion, and the resurrection.<p>I want to impress you, not with a doctrine, but with the wonderful Lord in whom we believe!<h2 class=head1>APPLYING THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2><p>When I was a young Christian, I found out that I had been crucified with Christ. According to some books I read, when Christ was crucified, I was included in Him. This puzzled me. He had died hundreds of years before and far away. How could I have died when He died? It was beyond my comprehension, but gradually I concluded that I should accept it by faith, in spite of its sounding so illogical. Other books later came to my attention. The thought in them was that the death of Christ is credited by God to my account. My part was to reckon myself dead, based upon that deposit in my account. For quite some time I practiced this advice, but frankly the more I reckoned myself dead, the more alive I seemed to be! No doubt many of you have had this same experience.<p>For years I was bothered by this failure to make the death of Christ apply to my everyday living. One day, however, the Lord opened the divine Word to show me that the death of Christ is included in His wonderful Person.<p>If you reach for the God of eternity past, all you will find is divinity. Today, however, when you come to God, He reaches you full of rich ingredients. We can liken Him to a flavorful drink. In eternity past He was only plain water. Now tea has been added. Then milk. Then sugar. Perhaps some other flavors. God is now a rich, delicious beverage, no longer just plain water!<p>Have you ever before realized how rich is the God in whom we believe? Since the day the Lord opened my eyes to see this, I have been released from my efforts to believe and to reckon. I have this living One within me. He is called the almighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. These are all different titles for the same wonderful Person.<p>In my early Christian life, my understanding of the Bible was according to what is generally believed. Only later did I begin to see how much more there is to the Bible than what is conventionally taught. I began to realize how great is this wonderful Person. As the years have gone by, He has shown me more and more. I long to convey to you how precious this One in resurrection is.<p>When you call on His name, He will reach you not merely as God, but with all that has been added to Him. God is Spirit. Do not think of God as one Person and the Holy Spirit as another. There is only one God, even though He is triune. The divine Spirit today includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is the God in whom you are abiding. &#8220;Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit,&#8221; 1 John 4:13 declares.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT MOVING</h2><p>This Spirit He has given us, which is simply Himself, is not dormant within. He is living, active, moving. Thus, the writer of this Epistle uses the term anointing. &#8220;Ye have an anointing [Gk.] from the Holy One, and ye know all things.... The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him&#8221; (1 John 2:20, 27).<p>Electricity moving and harnessed for our use is called the current of electricity. The current is not other than the electricity; it is simply electricity in motion. God moving within us is called the anointing. Because God today is the all-inclusive Spirit, He is symbolized not by oil but by an ointment. Ointment is a compound of various ingredients. God as the Spirit has been compounded with all these elements through which He has passed. This Spirit is gently and constantly moving within us as the anointing.<h2 class=head1>THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE</h2><p>This compound ointment is pictured for us in Exodus 30:23-25. The anointing ointment was made of four spices added to a hin of olive oil. Every one of the spices has a spiritual significance. Myrrh typifies the Lord&#8217;s sweet death. Whenever we consider that death, we find we have a sweet sensation within. Myrrh was one of the spices used in preparing Him for burial (John 19:39). Cinnamon, another of the spices of the anointing ointment, signifies the effectiveness of the Lord&#8217;s death. Cinnamon has certain healing properties. The third spice was calamus, a reed which grows out of muddy places high into the air. It speaks of resurrection. The Lord&#8217;s resurrection was like a reed shooting out of the muddy situation into the clear sky. Cassia, the last spice, repels insects and especially snakes. It reminds us of the power of His resurrection. The anointing ointment, then, includes the death of Christ, the effectiveness of His death, the resurrection, and the power of resurrection.<h2 class=head2>The Measure of the Spices</h2><p>The proportions of the spices used is also meaningful. The ointment had five hundred shekels each of myrrh and cassia, the first and last spices listed, and two hundred fifty each of cinnamon and calamus, the middle two spices.<p>First let us consider the number five hundred. Five in the Bible means responsibility; it is composed of four plus one. Four, like the four fingers of our hand, signifies the creature; one, like the thumb, signifies the unique Creator. By this arrangement of our fingers and the thumb, our hand is able to carry out what needs to be done. Four plus one means man plus God, or responsibility. With the number five hundred, we have responsibility increased a hundredfold. Myrrh and cassia, then, each form a unit of five hundred.<p>Cinnamon and calamus, the middle spices, are only a half unit each, two hundred fifty shekels. The two of them together form a unit. Why is this second unit split? All these spices, in three units of five hundred, signify the Triune God, the Second of whom was split when He was crucified. The first half is connected with His death, the second to His resurrection.<p>The number of spices was four, the human number. The measure of the spices was three units, the divine number. All these four are mingled with one hin of oil, again giving us four plus one, or five, the number of responsibility.<p>After this compound ointment was made, it was used to anoint both the tabernacle and the priests. This ointment, then, was mainly for God&#8217;s building and for His service. We are God&#8217;s dwelling place and also His priests. This anointing is for us! The anointing in Exodus 30 corresponds exactly to the anointing in 1 John 2.<h2 class=head2>Numbers Related to God&#8217;s Building</h2><p>The numbers most used in the compounding of the anointing ointment are three and five, both of which relate to God&#8217;s building. His first building was Noah&#8217;s ark, the measurements of which are mostly multiples of three and five. It was three hundred cubits long, thirty cubits high, and fifty cubits wide (Gen. 6:15). It was of three stories (v. 16).<p>Three and five are also the basic units of the tabernacle. Consider these dimensions or amounts:<p>(1) The altar 5 x 5 x 3 (Exo. 38:1)<p>(2) The ark 2  x 1  x 1  (Exo. 37:1)<p>(3) Sections 3 (outer court, inner court, Holy of Holies)<p>(4) Boards 10 x 1  (Exo. 36:21)<p>(5) Length of tabernacle 30<p>(6) Curtain loops 50 (Exo. 36:17)<p>(7) Brass taches 50 (Exo. 36:18).<p>Notice how all these measurements are either three or five, or are multiples or halves of three or five. Every single measurement is full of meaning, but for the present I would simply point out that these two numbers, which figure so prominently in the anointing ointment, are related to God&#8217;s building.<p>The anointing is the moving of the ointment. Its purpose is not for our individual spirituality but for the building and the priesthood, which are corporate.<h2 class=head1>THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p>As this ointment moves, the ingredients of which it is made will be applied to the very place where it moves. Christ&#8217;s divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection will be applied to your being. When you contact the Lord in a living way, the effectiveness of His death will be present. If you take antibiotics, they will kill the germs. There is no need for you to reckon that they are killed; the killing power is in the antibiotics, not in your reckoning. Besides the killing power, the anointing&#8217;s other rich ingredients will be applied and wrought into your being.<p>Suppose you have a bad temper. Surely from your experience you can testify that the only way to be rescued from it is to contact the living Lord. Within Him is a divine ingredient that kills the germs of your temper. By contacting the Lord, you are experiencing the application of the anointing to your temper.<p>How can we participate in this anointing? It is simply by abiding in the Lord. This means we must be always in touch with Him without any insulation. If we thus keep directly contacting Him, we shall experience the anointing applying the divine ingredients to our being. &#8220;Ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things.&#8221;<p>Day by day you will be transformed, not by following outward regulations but by having these divine ingredients added to you.<p>The anointing in 1 John 2 points directly to the anointing ointment in Exodus 30. When we consider the ingredients of this compound, we have to worship the Lord for such an accurate, unveiling picture. Our God has been compounded with all these wonderful ingredients. Because He has transferred us out of Adam and into Himself, we now have the position to abide in Him and let Him abide in us. If we thus keep ourselves attached to Him, we shall all the time be participating in what He is and what He has accomplished for us. By way of the anointing He will work Himself into us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF THE ANOINTING</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 30:25-31; Psa. 133; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 John 2:18-20, 22-24, 27</h1><h2 class=head1>A MUTUAL ABODE</h2><p>The revelation in the Bible is one. No book ever written is more consistent, even though it is composed of sixty-six books which superficially are quite different from each other. The central thought of the Bible is that God desires to mingle Himself with humanity, in order that man may become His dwelling place and that He may become a dwelling place to man. God will be the abode of man, and man will be the abode of God. When Moses said in Psalm 90:1, &#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations,&#8221; he was declaring that the highest experience we as human beings can have is to experience God as our dwelling place.<p>Many of us do not have the thought that we can dwell in God. God is our Redeemer, Savior, and life. But He also wants to be our dwelling place. Our home is where we are most comfortable. It is arranged the way we like it, and we have what we need there. Over the years I have had to stay in many different places. My hosts have generally been most kind and thoughtful, yet even in the places where I received the most gracious hospitality, I usually felt the lack of something that was readily available at home. In our dwelling place we have our food, our clothing, our loved ones, and many little things that are special to us; in short, we have everything. To experience God as our dwelling place means to have everything in Him, or to have Him as everything to us. Have we ever praised God for being our dwelling place?<p>We also must be a dwelling place to Him. &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you&#8221; (John 15:4) covers both of these aspects. &#8220;O Lord Jesus! We praise You that You are our abode. We can and we do abide in You. Even the more, we praise You that we are Your abode. You can and You must abide in us! If You don&#8217;t abide in us, where else can You abide? Heaven is only Your throne and the earth Your footstool. Without us, You have no place to dwell.&#8221;<p>Most Christians think of the heavens as the place where God dwells. But Isaiah 66:1 tells us, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?&#8221; Heaven is God&#8217;s throne, not His dwelling place. Without us, the redeemed human beings, God has no rest. What a wonder that we can be God&#8217;s resting place!<h2 class=head1>THE TEMPLE</h2><p>The temple in the Old Testament is called the house of God. If you read the Old Testament carefully, however, you will see that the psalmists and priests of old also considered the house of God their dwelling place. David said, &#8220;One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple&#8221; (Psa. 27:4). David&#8217;s only desire was to dwell in the Lord&#8217;s house and behold His beauty. He brought out the same thought in Psalm 23. At the beginning of the psalm he was enjoying the green pastures. We may appreciate the riches of the pasture, but to be there is like being in elementary school. If we go on to graduate school, we shall say, &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever&#8221; (Psa. 23:6)! The nourishment in the house is richer than that found in the pasture. &#8220;They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures&#8221; (Psa. 36:8). In God&#8217;s house we enjoy the fatness. The temple, then, was a dwelling place not only to God but also to all those who loved and served Him.<p>Once again I would call to your attention that the central thought of the divine revelation in the Bible is not that we be good or even that we be holy. Rather, it is that we abide in God and let Him abide in us. What a wonder it is that man can be thus mingled with God! Here we are, occupying a very little space, yet God would take us as His dwelling place and would say to us, &#8220;Man, come into Me and live in Me! Take Me as your abiding place!&#8221; This will be for eternity. We shall enjoy Him, and He will enjoy us. He will also express Himself through us.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY PREPARED</h2><p>How could this divine Being, who is pure, holy, and righteous, be one with us? We are fallen, sinful, corrupted, and condemned. Between the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation, there is a long record. During this interval in time, God passed through a process.<p>When Adam and Eve disobeyed God by partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they were in fear of the judgment to which God would sentence them. When God came seeking Adam, however, His way was to ask Adam, and then Eve, some questions. Rather than take direct responsibility for his wrongdoing, Adam passed the blame off on Eve and also on God. If God had not given him that woman, Adam implied, this problem would not have arisen. It was the woman who had given him the fruit to eat. Yes, he had eaten it, and that was wrong, no doubt; but the source of his disobedience, Adam maintained, was firstly God and then his wife. Without rebuking, God then turned to Eve and asked, &#8220;What is this that thou hast done?&#8221; (Gen. 3:13). Eve followed Adam&#8217;s tactic and passed the blame on to the serpent. By inference, she was also blaming God, who had created the serpent. Without arguing or condemning, God turned to the serpent, who was given no opportunity to explain. He was cursed and told, &#8220;I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel&#8221; (v. 15). As the man and his wife stood there trembling, expecting to hear themselves sentenced to death, they heard God say that the woman&#8217;s seed would bruise the serpent&#8217;s head. Eve would live! Adam believed the gospel and therefore &#8220;called his wife&#8217;s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living&#8221; (v. 20). Instead of death, there would be seed of this woman which would bruise the serpent&#8217;s head. This is the gospel, which Adam heard from the mouth of God and believed.<p>The record continues, covering many years of history, until we come to Isaiah, where we have another reference to the seed of the woman. &#8220;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel&#8221; (Isa. 7:14). The seed would be a son, yet he would be called &#8220;God with us&#8221; (Matt. 1:23). Isaiah further describes Him in 9:6, where he tells us that the child born is the mighty God and the son given is the everlasting Father. What wonderful Person can this be? Some seven hundred years later, Mary, a virgin, conceived a child of the Holy Spirit, thus fulfilling these prophecies in Genesis and Isaiah. This wonderful One is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, God with us!<p>God was now in human form. He was dwelling with man. At this point, however, God could not yet abide in man. Immanuel had to take another step. This He did by passing through death and entering into resurrection. At this juncture He changed from the flesh to the Spirit. &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:45, Gk.).<h2 class=head1>THE OLD TESTAMENT PICTURE</h2><p>Consider what has been added to God by this process through which He passed. Besides His divinity, He has now been compounded with humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Years ago I saw this. Then one day, while I was reading Exodus 30, the Lord enlightened me that the anointing ointment precisely portrays this now-compounded Spirit. Olive oil, which is commonly recognized as being a type of the Holy Spirit, is not the only ingredient of the anointing ointment. Four spices are compounded with it. The anointing ointment is made up of olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. This is the Old Testament picture of the processed and compounded God.<p>Not much more is said about the anointing until we come to 1 John 2. This passage clearly refers to Exodus 30. Biblical scholars have not been all that clear about the significance of this compound ointment.<p>As I did in the previous message, I would like to speak further on the numbers given us in relation to the ointment. Four, the number of spices, stands for the creature, while three, the number of times that five hundred occurs, speaks of the Trinity. The number four speaks of Christ&#8217;s humanity, without which He could not have entered into death. He was crucified in the flesh and thus destroyed the Devil who has the power of death (Heb. 2:14).<p>When we put four and three together, we get either seven or twelve, depending on whether we add or multiply. At the beginning of Revelation there are the seven churches. At the end there is the New Jerusalem, whose characteristic number is twelve. There are twelve foundations, twelve gates, and twelve apostles (Rev. 21:12,14), for example. The city has four sides with three gates on each side. When we are first saved, our number is four plus three, or seven. Eventually the numbers will be multiplied instead of added, and our new number will be twelve.<p>These four spices are blended with a hin of olive oil (Exo. 30:23-25). Four plus one speaks of responsibility. Four represents the creature, while one reminds us of God the Creator. Thus, God and man are brought together, like the four fingers of our hand and our one thumb.<p>I trust we can see how full and rich a picture is given us in the anointing ointment. All we need is included in this processed, compounded God. To stay in Romans 6 and reckon ourselves dead with Christ is not effective. According to our experience, such reckoning is vain. Brother Nee once said that Romans 6 can only be realized and experienced in Romans 8. What is found in Romans 8? It is the all-inclusive Spirit-the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, His Spirit who indwells us, the Spirit Himself. If we walk according to this indwelling Spirit, who is the compounded God, and have our mind set upon Him, we shall enjoy life, peace, victory, and holiness. All that this compound Spirit contains-divinity, the proper humanity, the death of Christ, and His resurrection-will be our portion.<h2 class=head1>GOD WROUGHT INTO US</h2><p>No doubt many of you have to some extent experienced this, even though you may not have identified it as such. Before vitamins were discovered, people still got the benefit of them by eating the proper foods, even though they did not know what it was in the food that kept them healthy. Similarly, when we take in this Spirit by setting our mind upon Him, by walking according to Him, by staying attached to Him, we experience His salvation. God&#8217;s central thought in His economy is to work Himself into us. This He is doing, firstly by having been processed, and secondly by anointing us with Himself, the anointed One.<h2 class=head1>A CORPORATE MATTER</h2><p>What God is doing is not mainly for you individually. After the anointing ointment was compounded, Moses was told to anoint the tabernacle with its vessels and Aaron and his sons for the priesthood (Exo. 30:26-30). In the Old Testament the tabernacle and the priesthood were two different matters. In the New Testament, however, these two are one. &#8220;Ye also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:5, Gk.). The spiritual house and the priesthood are the same. It is upon this that the anointing comes, rather than being for the individual.<p>Psalm 133 gives us a beautiful picture of this. &#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#8217;s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments&#8221; (vv. 1-2). Aaron was a type of Christ; his body was a type of the Body of Christ, the church. The ointment running down from the head over the whole body right down to the skirts depicts the brethren dwelling together in unity.<p>The anointing, then, is for the Body. If you notice the context of the verses on the anointing in 1 John 2, you will see that such is the case here as well as in Psalm 133. The anointing in the church life made a distinction between those who were true believers and those who were of antichrist.<p>If you have ever been out of the church life for a while, you may recall that during that time you experienced very little, if any, of the anointing. Yes, you still had the Spirit, but you lacked the ointment running down. On the other hand, as you sit in a meeting, you often have the sense of something running down through you. The message may not be eloquent. The meeting may not seem exciting. The sharing may be weak. You may not understand what is being said. You may even be annoyed with the way the meeting is going. Nonetheless, the ointment is running down over you. Time after time, as you attend the meetings, you will experience this anointing. The result will be a gradual change in you. Some of the divine essence is being added to you. Be sure you come to the meetings! God will be wrought into you! Even if you sit there sullenly disagreeing, the anointing will reach you and work a change in your being. Such is the wonderful anointing upon the Body that you experience in the church life.<p>You may hear a marvelous speaker and greatly enjoy his eloquence. After the meeting is over, however, your inner sense is that you have not received anything. In a church meeting, in contrast, those who share may be slow and grammatically incorrect. You may tire of hearing the same thing repeated over and over. You may think the meeting lasts too long. In spite of all this, the compound Spirit is being added into your being! Praise the Lord for His anointing in the church life!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF THE DIVINE BIRTH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4a, 18</h1><h2 class=head1>A FURTHER WORD ON THE ANOINTING</h2><p>Before we consider this mystery of the divine birth, I would like to add a further word about the anointing, which was our subject in the two previous messages. When we speak of the anointing, we are speaking figuratively. In actuality it is the divine Being Himself who is moving in us and being wrought into our being. There is no point to our making up our mind to improve our behavior. Though we try this, it is a waste of time. As long as we are saved and remain in the proper church life, this mysterious One will keep moving in us and transfusing us with all He has accomplished and obtained. In time our whole being will be saturated with the divine nature. We shall be as weighty as gold!<p>It is not only divinity which will be wrought into us; the proper humanity will be also. We shall have a resurrected, uplifted humanity. Furthermore, His death will also be worked into us, thus terminating all the negative things of the old creation.<p>This process going on in us is a lifelong matter; it is not accomplished overnight. Day by day, as we are in the church life, this compound ointment will be doing its work in us, until finally we are in resurrection. We shall all be translated from our present situation in the old creation into the new creation. This will be the fullness of resurrection. In the meantime, this anointing is constantly working within us, bringing us to this goal. Whether a meeting is living or not so living, this inward working still continues, infusing and transforming us. I am happy to see that there are a good number of young people who are experiencing this anointing and are thus undergoing the process of transformation.<h2 class=head1>THE SECOND BIRTH</h2><p>The first two chapters of 1 John form one section of the book, and the last three another. In previous messages, we have already considered the mysteries of life, fellowship, abiding, and the anointing presented in this book. These topics are mostly found in the first section.<p>Now we come to what I call the mystery of the divine birth. All those who have been redeemed have had two births: the first human or natural, and the second divine. The last verse of chapter two says, &#8220;...every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.&#8221; Here the matter of the divine birth is brought in. Then in chapter three, the first verse is, &#8220;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.&#8221; From here to the end of chapter five, this thought of divine birth is mentioned repeatedly, and the phrase &#8220;born of God&#8221; occurs a number of times (3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4a, 18).<p>It is surely a mystery to say that we have been born of God! That we have been created by God is commonly admitted. But to say that God is our Father, and that we therefore have His life and nature, is to make a great claim. Do we really believe that we have been born of God? Is God really our Father, not our adopted father or our father-in-law, but the One who has given us His life? Yes, these verses clearly declare that we have been born of God.<h2 class=head1>SOME PUZZLING VERSES</h2><p>&#8220;...Every one that doeth righteousness is born of him&#8221; (2:29). Do not misunderstand and think that doing righteousness is a condition, or term, of being born of God. The meaning here is that if you are born of God, you will surely do righteousness. This doing is an expression of your being born of God.<p>Why, then, I used to wonder, did I sometimes act unrighteously? Surely I was born of God, yet on one occasion after another I could be found doing what is not righteous.<p>If we go on to 3:9, we shall be bothered even more! &#8220;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&#8221; How can the Bible say that the one who is born of God cannot sin? Surely all of us can testify that our experience contradicts this!<p>Now look at 4:7: &#8220;Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.&#8221; Again, the meaning here is not that if we love others, we shall be born of God; rather, the evidence of our being born of God is that we love. Is this true of us? Honestly speaking, sometimes it is, and other times it is not. Since we are not always loving, can we say that we are born of God?<p>Then we come to 5:1: &#8220;Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.&#8221; I surely like the first part of this verse. From my youth it has been an encouragement to me to know that because I did believe that Jesus is the Christ I was born of God. However, the second part of the verse troubled me. Yes, I did love some of God&#8217;s children, but there were others that were not to my liking. Those I simply could not love.<p>Verse 4 goes on to say, &#8220;For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.&#8221; Notice here that we have &#8220;whatsoever,&#8221; not whosoever. Whatever is born of God overcomes the world. Is it true of you that you have overcome the world?<p>Verse 18 reads, &#8220;We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.&#8221;<p>Let us now sum up what this Epistle tells us about the one who is born of God.<p>(1) He does righteousness.<p>(2) He does not and cannot sin.<p>(3) He loves the brothers.<p>(4) He overcomes the world.<p>(5) He keeps himself.<p>(6) He is not touched by the evil one.<p>How are we to reconcile these facts with our experience?<h2 class=head1>OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT</h2><p>In the Gospel of John we have the key. &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (3:6). When we were born again, it was not our whole being which was regenerated. It was our spirit which was born of the Spirit. Where is our spirit located? This is not easy to answer, but from 1 Peter 3:4 we can say that the spirit is the hidden man of the heart. This inmost part of our being has been born of God. A divine birth has occurred in us. When 1 John 3:9 tells us that the one born of God does not commit sin, it adds, &#8220;for his seed remaineth in him.&#8221; The seed of God abides in our spirit.<p>The same one who wrote 1 John tells us in his Gospel, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&#8221; (John 1:12-13). This new birth is not of blood, that is, not of the physical life; not of the will of the flesh, that is, not of the fallen, soulish life; and not of the will of man, that is, not of the soulish life of the created man. The new birth is fully related to God; at the time of our regeneration, only our spirit is born of Him.<p>This is the key to understanding these otherwise troublesome verses in 1 John. &#8220;Whatsoever is born of God&#8221; (1 John 5:4) refers to the human spirit. This part of us does righteousness, does not and cannot sin, loves as God loves, overcomes the world, and keeps us. In this part we are safe from the evil one. This is our hiding place, our refuge, our high tower. To this place we flee whenever Satan comes. If we find our temper flaring, we must not struggle to keep it under control. To try to suppress our temper is to stretch out our neck for the enemy to cut off our head! Rather than fight to keep our self-control, we must withdraw to our spirit. This is our refuge.<p>Our regenerated spirit, then, is the key to understanding these verses regarding the characteristics of the one born of God.<h2 class=head1>PAUL&#8217;S CONFIRMATION</h2><p>The writings of Paul have this same thought, expressed in different terms. In Galatians 5:17 it says, &#8220;For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.&#8221; The word Spirit here indicates the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit. There is a part of our being, the flesh, which is against another part, our spirit. Paul exhorts us in verse 16 to walk by the Spirit in order that we may not fulfill the lust of the flesh. We must not stay in our flesh, but rather abide in our spirit, the part of our being which is born of God. Romans 8:4 also tells us that we are not to &#8220;walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&#8221; Within we have a spirit which has been born of God. We also have the flesh, which was born of the fallen nature. We must choose to walk in the part that has been born of God. This part does not and cannot sin, overcomes the world, loves what God loves, and keeps us from the evil one.<h2 class=head1>SIN NOT ERADICATED</h2><p>There is a teaching, based on 1 John 3:9, which claims that once we are saved, sin is eradicated; that is, it is no longer possible for us to sin. Nowadays this teaching is not popular, but it was quite common in China some forty or fifty years ago. There was a brother in Shanghai who preached the eradication of sin. He opposed Brother Nee&#8217;s teaching, based on Romans, that when we do not walk in the Spirit, we surely will sin. One day this brother, named Hwang, went with a few of his followers to a park, which required a ticket for admission. Instead of buying the needed number of tickets, Brother Hwang paid for only two or three. After two or three of those with him used these tickets to get in, they went back to where the others were waiting and handed the tickets over to them so that they could reuse them and get into the park without paying. One of those with him was troubled at this behavior. If sin has been eradicated, how could this Brother Hwang justify sneaking people into the park without paying? He did not question the preacher until later, when they had gotten home. Then he asked, &#8220;Brother Hwang, don&#8217;t you think it was a sin to slip people into the park without paying for them?&#8221; The preacher replied, &#8220;Oh no! That was not a sin. It was just a little weakness!&#8221; Whatever he wanted to call it, whether sin or weakness, it was undeniably a transgression, a sinful act.<p>You can see that this verse in 1 John 3:9 has stumbled many people. I was clear that our sinful nature is not eradicated, but in those days I did not know how to answer their challenge based on this verse. Gradually the Lord made me clear that the key is in &#8220;whatsoever&#8221; in 1 John 5:4. &#8220;Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.&#8221; It is not a person here, but a part, that is born of God. By looking further into John&#8217;s writing in the Gospel and by considering Paul&#8217;s Epistles, I came to realize that regeneration only happened in our spirit; only one part of us was born of God. This part cannot sin, cannot be overcome by the world, and cannot be touched by the evil one. How we must praise the Lord for such a part within us!<h2 class=head1>ABIDING IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Now that you have been born of God, it is in this part that you must remain. Do not try to do anything outside of this part. Do not attempt to do anything in your soulish life. Do not try to solve your problems by using your mind. Do not act in your emotions. Do not rely on your will, however strong it is. The only part within that really counts is your spirit, which has been born of God. This divine birth brings the divine life and nature into your spirit.<p>Keep coming back to this part. Do not take any action outside of here. Do not even think about loving or hating, about doing good or doing evil. Just be sure you are in this part. When you would love someone, first say, &#8220;Lord, bring me to my spirit; then I can love.&#8221; When you need to go shopping, say, &#8220;Lord, keep me in my spirit.&#8221; Even as a student, when you read or study an assignment or attend class, stay in this part.<p>As long as we abide in our spirit, we overcome the world, we do not sin, we can do what the Father would do and love what He would love, and we can keep ourselves. Satan cannot cross this boundary to reach us. Abide here. Take refuge in this high tower!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF THE DIVINE SEED</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:13, 24, 25; 3:15b; 4:4; 5:11, 12, 20, 16; Rom. 8:2, 6, 10, 11</h1><h2 class=head1>THE SEED OF LIFE</h2><p>We have still another mystery in this short book of 1 John. Previously we have covered the mysteries of life, fellowship, abiding, the anointing, and the divine birth. By the divine birth a seed was implanted within us. This is the mystery we would like to consider now.<p>&#8220;His seed remaineth in him&#8221; 1 John 3:9 tells us, meaning that whoever is born of God has the seed of God abiding in him. A seed of any kind is a seed of life.<p>In the parables of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus likened Himself both to a sower and to the seed. When He was on this earth, He sowed Himself as the seed into the soil of humanity. Human beings to Him are the soil in which He as the seed of life grows. Yet as that seed grows, many negative things arise to frustrate its growth. From this portion of the Word we can see that the seed mentioned in 1 John must be the Lord Jesus Himself as the seed of life.<p>First Peter 1:23 says that we have been &#8220;born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.&#8221; God&#8217;s word, then, is also a seed of life. Actually, to say this is the same as saying that the Lord Jesus is the seed of life, because He Himself is the Word of God. The living Word of God is the living Person of the Son of God. The seed of life is the Word and the Person.<p>The seed in 1 John, however, in a direct sense is simply the divine life with the divine nature. Our being is comprised of our life and nature. It is God&#8217;s life and nature which are imparted into us at the moment of regeneration.<p>We may pray a long, penitent prayer, thanking the Lord for dying on the cross and shedding His blood for our sins; taking Him as our Savior and confessing Him as the Son of God; and receiving Him as our Lord and our life. Long before we have finished praying, however, if we have truly prayed to Him from the depths of our being, we shall be regenerated. In a moment, the divine life and nature are imparted to us.<p>You may have no sensation that any such experience has happened to you. Do not depend on your feelings. Many things have happened to you, including your physical birth, of which you have had no sensation. You were born, but it did not depend on you. You have been born again, but that birth also is up to Him. Just as you had no say in whether you would be born in Massachusetts or in California, so in your second birth the decision is also out of your hands.<h2 class=head1>THE SEED IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Man, as we have often pointed out, can be represented by three concentric circles. The outer ring corresponds to our physical body, the part of us that has substance and can be seen and touched. Besides this part, we have a soul, represented by the middle ring. This is the psychological part of us, enabling us to think, to love or hate, and to make decisions. The soul, then, consists of the mind, the emotion, and the will. The innermost ring, the deepest part of man, is the spirit. You may not be clear about the human spirit, but one part of it, the conscience, you are familiar with. The conscience is deeper than the mind, emotion, and will.<p>Such is the way man is made. Animals may have a part that corresponds to the soul, but they lack this inner part, man&#8217;s worshipping organ. There has never been a case in the whole of history where a donkey, or a monkey, or a goat built a little sanctuary and set up an image to worship! The record of mankind, in contrast, is replete with religions, idols, temples, and forms of worship. Cultured or barbarian, ancient or modern-all peoples have a desire to worship a higher Being. What accounts for this difference between man and the animals? What constrains man to worship? It is because man was made by God with a spirit.<p>What is the distinction between an unregenerated human being and a believer? Both have these three parts of body, soul, and spirit. The believer, however, has a divine seed in his spirit. The seed of God abides in him!<h2 class=head1>THE GROWTH OF THE SEED</h2><p>This seed of the divine life and nature needs to grow. As it grows, it develops and spreads from the spirit into the soul, especially into the mind, the leading part of the soul. If we allow this seed to grow without hindrance, it will spread even to our mortal body.<p>In Romans 8:2 we find the term Spirit of life. In verse 10 we are told, &#8220;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.&#8221; From this verse we can see that it is the spirit which is regenerated, not the body. Our spirit is life, but our body is still dead. How about our soul? Whether our mind is life or death depends upon where we set it. &#8220;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace&#8221; (v. 6). The Spirit of life, then, comes into our spirit and enlivens it; the mind, in contrast, is only life when it is set on the spirit.<p>More is said about the body in verse 11. &#8220;But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.&#8221; The word dwell in this verse is stronger than the word abide; the meaning is &#8220;to make home.&#8221; To say that the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead makes His home in you, is to indicate that you are giving more ground to Him as the indwelling Spirit. The result will be that this Spirit will give life to your mortal body.<p>I trust that from these verses we can all see that at the time of our regeneration, only our spirit is born of God. This is why after regeneration we need to experience transformation in our soul and also await the transfiguration of our body. Through these three stages, God&#8217;s life is thoroughly worked into us. We have already experienced regeneration. Now we are in the process of being transformed in our soul. Some day we shall reach the goal, when our body will be transfigured. Then every aspect of death will be swallowed up by life.<h2 class=head1>ALLOWING THE SEED TO SPREAD OUT FROM OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Our regenerated, reborn spirit does not sin. This is not true of our soul, however, nor of our flesh. These two we must renounce and all the time go along with the spirit. If we set our mind, even our whole being, on the spirit, then the Spirit will have free course to spread into our mind, making it also life. Then if we give this divine life still further opportunity, it will spread even into our mortal body.<p>This seed has been sown into our inner being. As it is given opportunity, it spreads further and further. Such is the mystery of the seed within our spirit. It is altogether at variance with religion, even Christianity. Religion attempts to regulate people and help them to improve. God&#8217;s way of life is not like this. His way is to sow His life and nature as a seed into the heart of our being. We can stop our striving and efforts to correct our shortcomings.<p>We can pray, &#8220;Lord, I am nothing and can do nothing. But I am open to You. Thank You that You are the seed within me, waiting for the chance to sprout and grow. I would not do anything except open to You and let You have free course to grow and spread in me.&#8221; If we do this, a tender sprout will come forth from the seed within us.<p>It is hard for us to limit ourselves to praying in this way. Our religious thought rises up to say, &#8220;What! I don&#8217;t need to do anything? Doesn&#8217;t the Bible tell us to love our wives and submit to our husbands? Shouldn&#8217;t I try to control my temper?&#8221;<p>Your efforts to control your temper will be in vain. If you lose your temper today, do not wonder what you will do tomorrow. Let tomorrow take care of itself. There is nothing for you to do. You are not qualified to do anything. It is not God&#8217;s intention for you to do something. It is your fallen nature that makes you think you can rescue yourself.<p>Praise the Lord for the wonderful seed that has been sown into you! Do not try to do anything. Suppose you plant a seed in the earth. Then every day you dig in the soil to check how the seed is doing. Will that seed grow? Is it not better to leave the seed in the soil and go to bed and sleep in faith that the seed will grow?<p>The enemy is subtle. Before you love the Lord, he makes you careless and indifferent about your conduct, all the while making you think you are a well-mannered gentleman. Once you turn to the Lord, however, the enemy will come in to condemn, persuading you that you are the worst of the saints and that your behavior is far below the standard. This tactic of his causes you to resolve to improve, forgetting the spirit. Your salvation is not in your mind, but in your spirit. All your efforts to make up your mind are his device to turn you from the spirit.<p>What is needed is to contact the Lord that the seed may be watered. Spontaneously the seed will grow. This is salvation. Salvation is in this seed of life. It is not in our doing. It is not in our striving.<p>You will come to realize that this seed is nothing less than the Person of the Triune God, the Triune God Himself. He is the One in you who is greater than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). This greater One is living in you as the seed of life. Put your full trust in this One who is greater than Satan, greater than your self, and greater than your flesh.<h2 class=head1>BACK TO THE BEGINNING</h2><p>This wonderful Person is also the eternal life. He is the seed, the Person, and the eternal life which was from the beginning (1 John 1:1-2). From the beginning there was life; that which was from the beginning is the Word of life.<p>In this Epistle the writer considers the believers in three categories (2:13-27): fathers, young men, and little children. The fathers are the older, experienced ones; the young men are the stronger ones; and the little children are the babes in Christ.<p>The fathers, John tells us, &#8220;have known him that is from the beginning&#8221; (2:13). That is to say, the older ones should know life, since life is what has been from the beginning. After we have received life, many things rise up to distract us from that which was from the beginning. We know from our experience that time and again we have to be brought back to life, back to what was there in the beginning. If we are fathers, experienced ones in the church life, our concern will be about life. Other things we must drop. What counts is Christ as life. Nothing else is worth ministering but this life which was from the beginning.<p>The Apostle John here is the mender. When he was called by the Lord, he was mending fishing nets (Matt. 4:21). His ministry was to mend. In his time Christianity had already been damaged. His way to mend the situation was life. Today we need fathers in the church to bring the distracted ones back to the beginning, to life.<p>Then to the little ones John says, &#8220;Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father&#8221; (2:24). To let what was from the beginning abide in them means that they were to let life abide in them. This would bring them into the experience that the fathers had had.<p>John is telling us that life must be our only concern. Christians are preoccupied with doctrinal teachings and practices, like the method of baptism, the wearing of head coverings, and the way meetings are conducted. If these things matter to us, we are still babyish or at least childish. Once we grow up, we shall care only for that which was from the beginning.<p>This life is a Person. It is the Triune God as the seed sown into our being. As we care for that living seed, it will grow in us and spread life from our spirit into every other part of our inner being. As time goes on, others will be able to notice that a measure of life has been added to us. Through the years I have seen this growth in life of the young ones in the churches. How encouraging it is to see not the outward changes, but the growth of life from within!<h2 class=head1>ASKING LIFE FOR OTHERS</h2><p>This life is first in the Holy Spirit, then in our human spirit, then in our mind, and then in our physical body. There is still something further to be said about this life. &#8220;If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death&#8221; (1 John 5:16). If a brother has a problem with the Lord, we can pray for him. By praying we can minister life to him. To impart life to others, however, requires that we have more life ourselves. When we are filled with the riches of life, we shall have an overflow of life for others. There is the need of imparting life to others as a supply to them. If we ourselves are short of life, there will be none to impart to others. The hungry have nothing to feed others; they themselves must first be fed. After we have been richly fed, there will be an overflow for others.<p>First John presents life to us as a seed in our spirit. This seed will spread into our soul and then into our body. We can have an abundance of life to minister to others. This is the proper church life. What others need is not instruction or correction or regulation, but an abundance of the riches of this life imparted to them. In the church life we are enjoying the spreading of this life from our spirit to our soul and eventually to our mortal body. As it gains ground in us, we have the riches to impart to the needy ones.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE MYSTERY OF THE WATER, THE BLOOD, AND THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:6, 8-12; John 1:31-34</h1><p>The last mystery in the First Epistle of John is that of the water, the blood, and the Spirit. This Epistle is not a long one dealing with doctrinal points. John&#8217;s way of writing is to touch only the main, crucial points. Six of these we have already covered in the previous messages: life, fellowship, abiding, the anointing, the divine birth, and the divine seed. It is hard to understand the real meaning of 1 John. We may read it over and over, without really grasping what the significance of these terms is. Especially puzzling is this mystery of the water, the blood, and the Spirit.<p>&#8220;This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one&#8221; (1 John 5:6, 8). Why are there these three witnesses? What is meant by each of them? Schools of opinion have arisen to explain what water and the Spirit mean in this context. Concerning the blood, of course, it is generally agreed that this is the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross.<p>To know the real significance of this mystery, we must understand the central concept of this Epistle.<h2 class=head1>THE MAIN THOUGHT IN 1 JOHN</h2><p>John&#8217;s central thought is that God in His Son as the Spirit has come into us as our life. This life brings us into a fellowship-between Him and us and also with each other. This fellowship is corporate; there is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and there are the saints. This fellowship is actually the church life. The church life is a fellowship in the divine life. Since we have received God&#8217;s life and nature as a seed of life within us, we have this wonderful Person abiding in us as the Holy Spirit, a living, moving, active One. As such, He is the anointing to us. We abide in Him according to this anointing, and we let Him abide in us. By this abiding all things concerning the eternal purpose of God will be accomplished.<p>This central concept is focused on the Son of God. Whenever the New Testament uses this title, its significance always involves the imparting of the divine life. The Son of God was manifested for the purpose of imparting the divine life. &#8220;God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life....These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life&#8221; (1 John 5:11-13).<p>Why, then, is there the need of the witness of the water, the blood, and the Spirit? It is important for us to understand this, in order that we may apply its value; otherwise, we are lacking in something.<p>Yes, the Son of God came that we might have life. But He came in a way that puzzled people. He appeared as a Nazarene with no outward honor, with nothing to command respect. How could it be manifested that this One was in very fact the Son of God? It was by the water, the blood, and the Spirit that testimony was given as to His true identity.<h2 class=head1>THE WATER AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>From John 1:31-34 we can see how the water bore witness to Him. &#8220;In order that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water. And John testified saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him. And I did not recognize Him, but He Who sent me to baptize in water said to me, He upon Whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He Who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.&#8221; The first manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God was His baptism by John. This was the occasion when it was declared for the first time, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight&#8221; (Matt. 3:16-17).<p>Water baptism is commonplace now, but for John the Baptist to practice it was most unusual. Though he was the son of a priest, he was not brought up in the temple, nor did he wear the priestly garments, nor eat the priestly diet. He stayed in the wilderness, wore a garment of camel&#8217;s hair, and ate locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4). Such a way of living was contrary to what was expected of the priesthood. There was a garment prescribed for the priests (Exo. 28:4, 40-41; Lev. 6:10), yet John wore a robe made from the hair of an unclean animal (Lev. 11:4). He did not eat the normal food of the priests, but rather what he found in the wilderness.<p>This strange-looking person was bound to attract a following. When the crowds gathered, he told them, &#8220;Repent!&#8221; The Spirit was with John, and some did repent. Then they &#8220;were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins&#8221; (Matt. 3:6). For John to baptize them was to say that these repentant ones were good only to be buried, that they needed to be terminated. It must have been a strange sight for this strangely dressed preacher to put people into the water. One day yet another Person came to John to be baptized. This time something new happened. The other baptisms were quite ordinary, but after this One was baptized and came up from the death waters, the Spirit of God descended upon Him as a dove, and John testified that He was the Son of God.<p>In this scene the water and the Spirit were both present to introduce this little Jesus as nothing less than the Son of God. He was not merely a Nazarene. Along with the water and the Spirit, a voice from the heavens bore witness that this was the beloved Son.<h2 class=head1>THE BLOOD</h2><p>How does the blood bear witness?<p>Some very special features were present at the crucifixion of Christ. For one thing, there was darkness over all the land (Matt. 27:45). For another, the Jews wanted to get the bodies off the cross before the upcoming great Sabbath (John 19:31). Thus they got permission for the soldiers to break the legs of the three who were being crucified in order to hasten their death. This the soldiers did to the two robbers. When they came to Jesus, however, they could see that He had already died. Instead of breaking His legs, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear; from that wound there came out blood and water.<p>These and the other things which happened caused fear in the heart of the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, and they cried out, &#8220;Truly this was God&#8217;s Son!&#8221; (Matt. 27:54). No doubt the centurion was thus saved. He believed that the crucified Nazarene was the Son of God.<p>Jesus, then, was manifested as the Son of God in an open way by the water of baptism, by the blood He shed on the cross, and by the Spirit. By these three means God introduced His Son to mankind that they might believe and have eternal life.<h2 class=head1>TERMINATION</h2><p>Notice that the water referred to in 1 John is not life-giving, but terminating. The message that the baptism of Jesus testifies to is the termination of the old creation. We all need to be terminated. Do not argue about the form of immersion; the Bible has little to say about the method. What matters is to be buried! God does not want the old creation. Whether we consider ourselves good or bad, of high caliber or worthless, God says all we are deserving of is burial. The water of baptism means judgment. God&#8217;s judgment is that we and all the rest of the old creation need to be terminated. This is what the water testifies to us.<h2 class=head1>REDEMPTION</h2><p>Why do we need the blood? The blood is for redemption. From the old creation, which needs to be terminated, a part has been predestinated by God to be His vessel. This part needs to be redeemed back to Him. God has taken care of both our termination and our redemption. When Jesus died on the cross, His all-inclusive death terminated all the old creation, including the old man and the flesh. At the same time, He shed His blood to redeem back what God had chosen.<h2 class=head1>GERMINATION</h2><p>Why do we need the witness of the Spirit? The Spirit germinates. We have been terminated, but we were also marked out before the foundation of the world. Because God chose us, He redeemed us. However, we were lifeless because of being terminated. When the Spirit came, He caused the seed to germinate. The seed is the Son of God. Today we are living, moving, and behaving in the Spirit. The Holy Spirit today is the Spirit of life. This life is the germinating seed within.<p>We have been terminated, redeemed, and germinated. This life germ within is to be the source of our life and all our actions, even our breathing. This is the message of the Apostle John. Yes, this Epistle does tell us to love one another, but there are not as many exhortations here as there are in most other Epistles. It touches the basic germ, not the outward doing. The Lord Jesus has come to us in water, terminating us; in the blood, redeeming us; and in the Spirit, germinating us. Once we see that we have been terminated, that God has chosen and redeemed us, and that He wants to bring to fruitfulness the life He has germinated in us, we shall cease from our doing. As He lives, we shall live with Him. As He moves, we move with Him. As He works, we work with Him. This is life, that which was from the beginning.<p>This central concept will save us from culture, religion, doctrines, and practices. All these are distractions from the life which was in the beginning. This life is the Son of God, who today is the all-inclusive Spirit, living within us as the life germ. He is working in us to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose that we may all reach that glorious goal. There is no need for us to be concerned about this and that. We can focus all our attention on the seed. Then our growth in life will be assured.<h2 class=head1>NOT RELIGION</h2><p>How different this is from religion! When I was a child, I went to Sunday school and heard the Old Testament stories and the stories of Jesus. I also heard the doctrines, like the husbands being told to love their wives and the wives being told to submit to their husbands. I saw that such exhortations did not avail. I was baptized in a denomination, but that act had no significance. I could not see any sign of spiritual growth in those who were members, even after many years. We were all in the practice of religion, and our condition was pitiful.<p>In the proper church life there must be a germination. We cannot remain the same. Even after two weeks, there is a difference. After two months there will be a bigger difference. There will be a steady growth in life. The church practice is to terminate people, to get them redeemed, and to germinate them!<p>After one of our ten-day trainings is over, I can sleep well. I am able to sleep long hours, because within me there is the conviction that a good work of germination has been done. If we come together three months later, I see all the sprouts coming forth! The church life is not a matter of teachings, practices, and regulations. It is a matter of terminating, redeeming, and germinating-the water, the blood, and the Spirit. This is the way the Son of God has come to us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>SEVEN ISSUES OF THE SEVEN MYSTERIES</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:13-17; 3:8; 4:4; 5:18-21; 2 John 9-11; 3 John 9-10</h1><p>We have now finished the seven mysteries mentioned in 1 John: (1) life; (2) fellowship; (3) abiding; (4) the anointing; (5) the divine birth; (6) the divine seed; and (7) the water, the blood, and the Spirit. If we are in the reality of these mysteries, there will be seven things which characterize us.<h2 class=head1>I. DISTINCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF LIFE</h2><p>There should be growth in the church life. It is all too common for Christians to remain the same year after year. If we are still the way we were ten years ago, all of us will be on the same level as far as life is concerned. This is a poor situation and indicates a lack of growth. Among us there should be fathers, young men, and little children.<p>If you were saved some years ago, you should not still be a babe, only able to call, &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221; You should be strong, having the Word of God abide in you and overcoming the wicked one (1 John 2:14). By the nourishing, watering, enlightening word in the Bible, you should be able to testify how you have been strengthened and that all worldly things are under your feet. Have you reached such a stage?<p>In the church life we should be able to see three stages of growth. New ones should be born in our midst-little children, who know the Father (2:13). As in a family, we love, care for, and protect these little ones, who are lively and even sometimes naughty. But we need also those on another level-young men, strong enough to fight the enemy and guard the church against any attacks. They should be strong in the Word, able to resist the world, the satanic system which frustrates people from God&#8217;s purpose and from enjoying Him. Finally, we must also have those on the highest level-the fathers, who keep going back to the beginning.<p>That which was from the beginning is the eternal life. The Son of God as the life-giving Spirit is the origin of all things. The origin of the church, of holiness, of our new birth, and of our growth is life. Because of their experience, the fathers in the church have learned to stay with life. When others go to them to argue about doctrines or to get help with a problem in their family relationships, the fathers always bring these inquiring ones back to life.<p>To have these three levels in the church life is one issue of the seven mysteries we have been considering. We shall see in the church some lively and living new ones, some strong, vigilant young men, and some fathers rich in life.<h2 class=head1>II. A TESTIMONY OF VICTORY</h2><p>Another issue will be a strong testimony that the One who is in us is greater than the one in the world. We shall hear testimonies of victory, which declare to the whole universe that the Triune God who is within us is greater than the evil one, Satan, who is in the world. These victories in our family life, in our school life, and among the older ones are the outcome of the seven mysteries. We shall all realize that the dear One who abides in us far outweighs Satan. This victorious testimony could not be if the church is merely for doctrine. We can testify that our God is the greatest because we have experienced Him in these seven ways.<h2 class=head1>III. OVERCOMING THE WORLD</h2><p>Thirdly, there will be no place for the world. Without being exhorted not to love the world, the church will nonetheless find that the world has no hold on it. Because it contains the divine seed of life, the church will have no part in the world. The distinction goes further than not loving the world.<p>&#8220;Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world....He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not&#8221; (1 John 5:4, 18). The keeping or guarding mentioned here is mainly from the world. The world is a satanic system which has ensnared everyone, including Christians. The only way out of this trap is by the life germ within us.<p>There was a pastor of over twenty-five years&#8217; experience who was helped by the ministry and began to know life. Some of the sisters in the church talked with his wife and tried to be of help to her. One of them gave a testimony of being restrained by the Lord when she went shopping. She picked up one item and then another, and both times she had a sense within that she should put them back. On hearing this testimony, the pastor&#8217;s wife was troubled. Although she had been a Christian for many years, she had never heard of such an experience. She concluded that the sisters must have been told by Brother Lee that they should not buy certain things!<p>I tell you this story to illustrate that you may pastor a congregation for years and preach sermons to them out of the Bible, yet after all your labors they may still know very little about life. Is not such a congregation trapped in the world, even as secular people are?<p>If the church is practicing the seven mysteries, on the other hand, they will be filled with life. They will hear the little word &#8220;no&#8221; time after time. When they go for a haircut, or when they go shopping, a voice within will say no to what they want. One of the most common words the Lord says to them is &#8220;no.&#8221; When they eventually agree with this no and go along with the inner constraint, they will have an amen within. Then their response will be, &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221;<p>From what comes this inner speaking? From life. There is no outward regulation, but Someone is within. This life is the substance of these mysteries. As the life grows, we shall be rescued from the world. Yet rescue is not the best word here. We shall rather rise above, or grow out of, the world. We are the calamus plant, shooting out of the muddy situation into the clear sky. This is resurrection. When we look down from the heavens, we shall see how small, how pathetic, and how unlovely the world is. We shall wonder how we could ever have thought it attractive. Thus, the whole church will rise up from the world.<h2 class=head1>IV. NOT TOUCHED BY THE WICKED ONE</h2><p>Fourthly, Satan cannot touch such a church. He is out to make gain, but he finds out that whenever he touches that church, he suffers a loss. Even if he is invited, he will stay away!<p>First John 5:18 concludes, &#8220;That wicked one toucheth him not.&#8221; This is the only verse in the Bible which contains such a declaration. Our fallen concept is that Satan will always bother us, that he is too much for us, and that we cannot overcome him. We must pay attention to what this verse says. If a poker is heated white-hot in a fire, no one dares to touch it for fear of being burned. Today, on this earth, the church can be that threatening to Satan! Even in an evil city like New York there can be a church that the wicked one touches not. He will tell his demons to stay away, lest they get burned because the fire is so hot. What a glory to the Lord and what a shame to Satan when a church is so on fire!<p>If in our prayer meetings we pitifully beg the Lord to deal with our enemy, we are short of life, short of these seven mysteries. If we are filled up with them, Satan will stay away to avoid disaster.<h2 class=head1>V. NOT HAVING IDOLS</h2><p>&#8220;Children, keep yourselves from idols&#8221; are the closing words of 1 John (5:21). It seems like a strange conclusion, after the mention of the wonderful matters of life, fellowship, abiding, the anointing, the divine birth, the divine seed, and the water, the blood, and the Spirit. What are the idols? Notice the previous verse. &#8220;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life&#8221; (v. 20).<p>Idols, we can see from the context, are whatever is not the true God. What is the true God? It is the Triune God experienced by us as our life in a practical way. This life is a seed within, a life that overcomes the world and that Satan dares not touch. This life is in us and is the true God. Do you say that the God you worship is in the heavens? The God in 1 John is in us as our life, overcoming sin, the world, and Satan. This very life is the true God; whatever is not this true God in our experience is an idol.<p>Suppose, for example, the life within you says you should get your hair cut. You cannot bear to go along, and beg the Lord to tolerate your hair the way it is for a while longer. To do this is to have an idol. The same may be true in regard to your shopping. If you bring home something from your shopping that the Lord has said no about, you are bringing home an idol. It might even be a leather, gilt-edged Bible. If the Lord within you says no, yet you insist upon buying it, even this Bible has become an idol to you. Whatever is against this inner life, in His eyes is an idol.<p>Our God today is not only the Creator, living in the heavens. He has come through water, blood, and Spirit and is now the seed, living within you. This is the true God and eternal life. Anything other than this is an idol. Children, keep yourselves from idols. To have an idol there is no need for you to go to a heathen temple. Whatever you take when He has said no is an idol. An idol in principle is anything that substitutes for God. The true God is simply eternal life. Anything which takes the place of this life is an idol.<h2 class=head1>VI. REJECTING ANTICHRISTS</h2><p>The sixth issue of the mysteries is found in 2 John 9: &#8220;Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.&#8221; The word transgresseth is more accurately rendered &#8220;goes forth&#8221; or &#8220;goes too far.&#8221; What does it mean to go too far and not abide in the doctrine of Christ? The doctrine of Christ is that Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated and, after thirty-three and a half years of living on this earth, was crucified in our stead, shedding His blood to redeem us; He was buried and arose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit; today we have His blood and His Spirit. Those who have gone too far and do not abide in this doctrine do not believe that Christ is the Son of God; that He came as a man for our redemption; that He shed His blood for our sins; and that He rose from the dead to impart Himself as life into us. What they teach is that Christ is simply a man who lived a good life and set us an example to follow.<p>Notice how the Apostle John says such people should be treated: &#8220;Receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: For he that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds&#8221; (2 John 10-11). People like this are the ones John calls antichrists. They may call themselves Christian and consider themselves part of Christianity, but they deny Christ&#8217;s deity, His redemption, His resurrection, and even His virgin birth. They are actually blaspheming Him. In this category of those who have gone too far and are not abiding in the doctrine of Christ are Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, the Mormons, and the modernists. All these are antichrists.<p>If the church practices these seven mysteries, it will not tolerate such people. There will be a clear line drawn, because the church will recognize that these have no anointing. The living Body cannot take the presence of corpses, anymore than we would be able to sleep in a room where there was a dead body!<h2 class=head1>VII. NOT FOLLOWING DIVISIVE ONES</h2><p>The last issue is found in 3 John 9-10: &#8220;I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.&#8221;<p>Whether Diotrephes was a real Christian I do not know, but he was one who loved to have the first place in the church. He was one who dominated the church in which he was, rejecting the apostles and some good saints and even casting out of the church those who received these saints. You may think he is an extreme case, but the same thing is still existing today.<p>What is the cause of division? It is mainly because of the rivalry for the leadership. &#8220;I want to be the head. I will not be under you. If I am not number one, I will set up another group so that I can be in charge.&#8221; No one, of course, will openly make such a declaration. He will wear a beautiful cloak and hide behind it if accused of causing division. But as a church, full of life, we can see through his outward pretense. Thus, we reject both antichrist and Diotrephes. If we refuse to follow self-appointed leaders, there will not be any division. Christ is our only Head.<h2 class=head1>VIII. A SUMMARY</h2><p>These, then, are the seven issues that result from the seven mysteries. First, there will be the growth that brings in the distinctions in life between the little ones, the young ones, and the fathers. Second, there will be a strong testimony of victory over the evil one. Third, the church will rise up out of the world. Fourth, Satan will not dare to touch the church. Fifth, we shall keep ourselves from idols. Sixth, we shall have nothing to do with antichrists. Seventh, we shall not give a following to divisive ones.<p>These issues are the outcome of life. They cannot be brought about by regulations. They result from our being in the reality of the seven mysteries: life; fellowship; abiding; the anointing; the divine birth; the divine seed; and the water, the blood, and the Spirit.</body></html>
