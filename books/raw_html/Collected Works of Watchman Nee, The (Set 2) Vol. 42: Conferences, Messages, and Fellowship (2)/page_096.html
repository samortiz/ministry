<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 24, 1936<br />Place: Foochow, Brother Nee's mother's home</h1><h2 class="head1">A NARRATION OF HISTORY</h2><p>In 1921 Brother Leland Wang and I were being raised up by the Lord together. In 1920 Miss Dora Yu had come, and Sister Ding, Sister Hwang, Brother Leland, and myself had all been saved. Pastor Hsu Je-chou was saved at that time also. My mother and brother began to have a Bible study meeting with a few other brothers. The first year after I was saved, there was a Bible study meeting every Thursday at my home. Most of the ones who came to the Bible study were older ones. Brother Leland and I were the youngest among them, and naturally we were together quite often. I was baptized in 1921. None of the others were baptized at that time; I was the only one who was baptized. After I was baptized, I still enjoyed my worldly amusements. In 1922 Leland and I began to see the truth concerning the breaking of bread, and we began to break bread together. In the beginning of 1923, four or five hundred people were saved, and there was a revival. Brother Leland and I shared the responsibility: I took care of the work in Foochow and the literature work, while Leland took care of the work beyond Foochow. Brother John Wang also left his denomination during the second half of 1923 and joined us in our work. Originally, John did not agree with the matter of baptism. Later he also saw the truth about baptism, and I baptized him.</p><p>In 1922 I began to see that denominationalism was wrong and that missions were also wrong. I saw that God wanted local assemblies. In 1923 Leland had a disagreement with me concerning some doctrines. His burden was for evangelism, while I saw that God was after the local assembly. In other words, Leland's work was hawking his goods, while my work was setting up stalls for my goods. John was not as experienced in the truth, and therefore was not involved in the dispute. In 1924 the dispute resulted in the assembly calling itself "The Church of Christ in Foochow," and the stamp of the assembly was changed to read "The Church of Christ in Foochow." I questioned Leland and told him that this was not scriptural. If we named ourselves in this way, many unsaved ones would also be included. Moreover, there were not many saved ones among us, and other groups had four or five hundred saved ones. Therefore, we could not call ourselves "The Church of Christ in Foochow."</p><p>During the first half of 1924, Wu Ai-lan's father (Mr. Woodbury) wanted to come to ordain Leland as the preacher, myself as a teacher, and John also as a teacher. I said that I needed a few weeks to study the Bible before I could say either yes or no. After I studied the Bible, I realized that pastors and teachers are gifts and cannot be ordained. One can appoint elders, but one cannot ordain pastors and teachers. The pastors or shepherds and teachers are like carpenters and concrete workers&mdash;one cannot ordain them. If a man is a carpenter or a concrete worker, he simply is one, and there is no way to ordain him as one. It is the same with a teacher&mdash;one cannot ordain a teacher. One can appoint a registrar or a principal, but he cannot ordain a person to be a teacher. One can appoint elders and deacons, because these are offices, but one cannot ordain pastors and teachers.</p><p>During the last term of the eighth year at Trinity College, Leland told everyone a few weeks before the final examination that Mr. Woodbury would come the following week. When I heard this, I knew that the situation had become critical. At that time I was conducting a Bible study on the Lord's coming, and I changed the subject to a study on the ark. I saw that God's testimony followed the ark, which was a type of Christ. When the ark was in the tabernacle, God's glory was there. But when the ark left the tabernacle, the tabernacle became an empty shell. God's countenance left the tabernacle and went with the ark. I presented this truth to everyone. I wrote to the co-workers, made a copy of it, and distributed it to every brother and sister. After the letter was distributed, Mr. Woodbury did not come, and I was very happy.</p><p>After this I was invited to preach in Hangchow, and the co-workers in Foochow excommunicated me because of that letter. All the brothers did not agree with the view of the co-workers. The brothers believed me, but the co-workers rejected me. When I returned in July of 1924, I persuaded the brothers to continue to work in oneness. I proposed that I go from Foochow and work elsewhere. I did not want to have a split because of this dispute, so I left Foochow. I thought that I could preach the truth about the local assembly in other provinces. Later, the truth that the Lord had entrusted to me did spread to other places. From 1924 to 1936, in a period of a little over ten years, over two hundred assembles were raised up throughout China. Foochow became an exception; it has never been clear about the truth. In spite of this, we have always believed that God could accomplish His own work. We were not hasty; we waited for over ten years. During this time, there were over ten proposals by various brothers to start another meeting in Foochow. Personally, I have been against starting another meeting. But if you want to do it, I will not oppose it.</p>
