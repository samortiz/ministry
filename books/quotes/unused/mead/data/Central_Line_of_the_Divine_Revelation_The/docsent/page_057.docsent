   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING MESSAGE TEN THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE FULL GOSPEL OF GOD IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ECONOMY 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; Gal 3:14; John 20:22; 14:9-11, 16-20; 16:13-15; 1 Cor 2:7-12; 2 Cor 13:14; Rom 8:2, 6, 9-11; John 16:7b-11; 3:5-6; 1:12-13; Gal 4:6; Rom 8:15; 2 Cor 3:3b; Eph 1:11a, 13; 4:30b; 2 Cor 1:22a; Eph 1:14; 2 Cor 1:22b</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the center and totality of the entire Bible, especially the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As portrayed in the four Gospels, Christ is God, a man, a King, and a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this is not a full and proper definition of who and what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible is a record of Christ as a threefold seed in humanity who became a life-giving Spirit, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, for our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The very Triune God became a man as the human seed of three persons the woman Mary , Abraham, and David.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the beginning of the Old Testament, Genesis 3:15 says, "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seed of the woman accomplished many things on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He destroyed Satan Heb 2:14 , took away sin John 1:29 , nullified death 2 Tim 1:10 , and terminated our old man Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then, in the middle years of the Old Testament history, God promised Abraham a seed who would become the blessing to the entire world Gen 12:2-3; Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seed of Abraham as the God-man, the very Triune God in a man, is the very God given to and enjoyed and experienced by man as the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the whole universe only God Himself is a blessing; all else is vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have God, we have the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the way for God to be our blessing involved a process.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For food to become our blessing, it must be cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, God had to be "cooked" in order to be our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before passing through a process, God was a "raw" God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By passing through a process, God became the "cooked" God and was "put on the table" as our food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This God in His totality is the processed, consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He as the wonderful Spirit is the blessing from God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the seed of David the king, Christ is the successor to David's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Isaiah 55:3 and Acts 13:34, this seed of the king is the sure mercies of David.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The resurrected seed of David is the sure mercies that God covenanted to David.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mercies are the initiation of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God gives Himself to us as a blessing through many kinds of mercies as the initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This verse indicates that the Spirit and the bride are a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The term the Spirit indicates the process of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The processed Triune God will marry the redeemed and glorified tripartite man, and together they will become a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 21 and 22 show us that the New Jerusalem is a compound, a mingling, a blending, of this processed Triune God with the chosen and glorified tripartite saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the blessing given to us based on God's sure mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Christ as the human seed lived and consummated His ministry on earth, He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From that point onward, whatever has taken place related to Christ has been something of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the very God whom we have received and are worshipping and serving is the consummated Triune God, the reality of whom is the life-giving Spirit, who is the realization of the man Jesus, the threefold seed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the central line, the contents, the substance, and the essence of the entire Bible.</S>
