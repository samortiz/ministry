It is true that we must first recognize Him as our Savior before we can know the Lord as God. But it is not enough to know Him only as the Savior; it is not enough to know only His redeeming work. His redeeming work is to lead men to know Him as the Creator.</p><p>The blood is first in order but not in importance. God's motive is not that we should just know Him as Savior. In Matthew 4:10 the Lord added the words, "You shall worship the Lord your God," to the first commandment in Exodus. God wants worship. The meaning of the word worship in Hebrew is "to kneel down." The meaning of this word in Greek is "to go forward to kiss the hand" and give everything to Him. Many do not know the secret of worshipping God. Yet we have to know that the Lord is God.</p><p>Jesus is God. How precious this fact is! God wants man to declare that He is God. The Lord's prayer is connected with the Ten Commandments. He told the disciples what God wanted. "Your name be sanctified" (Matt. 6:9). This tells us the first thing God hopes to see. What does it mean for the Lord's name to be sanctified? The word holiness or sanctification means to be set apart for God. For example, if I buy a Bible, it becomes mine. It is set apart for me, and I can say that it has become holy unto me. The name of God is set apart for God; it can be used only by God. This is the meaning of "Your name be sanctified." Now the name is being used by others; now it is general. One day it will be specific. Only Jehovah will be called God; nothing else will be called God.</p><p>God's demand of men is that they know Him as God. The Lord said to Mary after resurrection, "My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). The word Father speaks of an individual relationship, whereas the name God speaks of a universal relationship.</p><p>Worship is confessing that He is God. Deuteronomy is the epistle of the Old Testament. It is Moses' epistle to the Israelites. In Deuteronomy he told them to worship God and nothing else. If they worshipped something else, they would be stoned to death.</p><p>What is the work of the devil? In Eden we cannot see what the work of the devil is. Isaiah shows us the devil wants to be like God; but we do not see what his purpose is. In Matthew 4 we can see his purpose. The devil tempted the Lord Jesus. In the first two temptations the devil had no special emphasis, but the goal of the third was that the Lord would "worship me." This was the devil's motive. The Lord quoted from Deuteronomy: "You shall worship the Lord your God." For six thousand years the devil has been seeking worship. God wants worship, and Satan also wants worship. All of the worship of idols is actually the worship of Satan. Satan fears for men to be saved because they will worship God. This is why he hates for men to be saved. In the book of Revelation we see a special line&mdash;the line of worship. In chapters four, five, and nineteen, we see the elders and living creatures worship. In chapter thirteen there is the contrast of the beast and his image being worshipped on earth. Satan wants to obtain on earth what God is receiving above. Satan's motive is not only just to make man sin but to make man worship him. Satan's kingdom is maintained by man's worship. The result of this worship is sin.</p><p>Satan's happiest day will be when Antichrist calls himself "God" (2 Thes. 2:4). This is what Satan has wanted throughout the past six thousand years. The worship of the beast is the worship of Satan. Revelation 13 shows that the beast wants worship. The message of the "eternal gospel" in 14:6 and 7 is to "worship Him." In Revelation 22 the last commandment in the New Testament is to worship God. Since God's motive is to obtain worship and Satan's motive is to obtain worship, what is the duty of a Christian? It is not enough to just have salvation. What will satisfy God? It is not enough to just pray or preach. God needs our worship of Him, and what Satan fears is our worship of God.</p><p>Worshipping is giving God that which one day will be exclusively His. Christ is the firstfruit. We give Him now what one day the world will give Him. We should not wait for the new heaven and new earth to come before we worship God. Now in the old creation, we can worship Him. At this time we want to give special worship to God, because Satan is getting worship for himself more and more. If we are defeated in worship, we will be defeated in other things.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
