   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One brother, whom I knew for about thirty years and who is now with the Lord, is a good example of this grace-ministering service.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He did not speak much in the meetings because he was not assigned with that kind of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But whenever I went to his locality in Taiwan, I always saw him serving in some way in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was a retired general from the army who lived on his pension and spent all his time to serve the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even though he did not speak much in the meetings, the church received the greatest service from him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was respected by all the saints and highly valued by the co-workers because of his service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He served the saints in many ways to meet their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, we expect that all of the brothers and sisters would function by opening their mouths to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we do not like to force the saints to do this, because some do not have the particular portion of grace to be speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you ask certain ones to function, it is like putting them into a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To some extent, we have to make this clear publicly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can say that we realize that some of the saints do not have a speaking portion, so we would not force them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have an eating and a breathing mouth but not a speaking mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But they should still serve the church according to the grace which has been given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They can serve practically in something like vacuuming the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the saints will receive the benefit of their vacuuming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is the "vacuuming" grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should illustrate the practical service to the saints in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of the saints may be bothered about not speaking to such an extent that they dare not come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They may not feel happy about coming to the meeting and may even feel somewhat shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not have that particular aspect of grace, so it is difficult for them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But on the other hand, we have to make it clear that no one who has a mouth should take an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may be able to deceive people, but you cannot deceive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord knows you are very talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A brother may not speak in the meetings so much, but he may speak a lot to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to dwell upon this point to impress all the saints that all of them are stewards entrusted with some aspect of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's grace is manifold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You cannot say that you have never been given grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have been given grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You do not have the aspect of grace that Paul had or the aspect of grace that some of the elders have, but you surely have an aspect of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has given you something.</S>
