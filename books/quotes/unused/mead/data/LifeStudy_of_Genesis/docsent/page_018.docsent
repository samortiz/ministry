   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Process 1 The Spirit Came 1:2b</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's original creation was damaged by Satan's rebellion and then judged by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After God's judgment, there remained nothing except darkness upon the surface of the deep water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies a death condition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the midst of this death condition, the Bible suddenly says, "And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isn't this wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit was brooding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"The Spirit was brooding" as a hen broods over her eggs in order to produce little chickens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Bible first says something about the Spirit, it doesn't say "the power of the Spirit," "the might of the Spirit," but it says that the "Spirit of God was brooding over the surface of the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that He was preparing to generate life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see that the record of Genesis 1 is something related to life, to God's gospel, and to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this we have a strong proof in 2 Corinthians 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul says, "God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This certainly was a reference to chapter one of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this one verse, we can realize that everything recorded in Genesis 1 must be related to life, to God's shining, and to God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Based upon this verse, we need to interpret everything according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to recall our condition before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were just waste and empty, our lives were meaningless, and we were covered with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Within us was an abyss, a bottomless pit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And in this abyss was a swarm of demons, driving us to lose our temper, to gamble, to go to the movies, and to do many other evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were waste and empty, yet full of darkness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day, some living One began to hover over us, to work within our heart, to brood upon the death and the deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was not something psychological or ethical, but the living One working within us, working so gently, lovingly, like a big hen brooding over the eggs in her nest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the brooding and the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus said John 16:8-11 that when the Holy Spirit is come, He will reprove, He will convince the world meaning humanity of sin related to Adam , of righteousness related to Christ , and of judgment related to Satan .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will rebuke in a brooding way, in a very kind way, not in a violent way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the whole universe, there are only three persons Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy Spirit works within us, convincing us that we were born in Adam and have nothing but sin, that we have no way to escape sin and Adam's influence without believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Holy Spirit will brood within us and speak to us, saying, "Look, Jesus died on the cross for you and He has accomplished everything that is required by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now the real righteousness is with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you turn to Him and believe in Him, you will receive Him as your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has passed through incarnation, He has passed through life on this earth, He has passed through crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now He is accepted by God at His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is there as the proof that if you believe on Him, you will be free of sin and obtain righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you don't do this, you will go with Satan into God's judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By this brooding of the Holy Spirit, you will be fully convinced and will say, "Lord Jesus, I have nothing to say, but I thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this, you are regenerated, you are born again of the Spirit John 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of God came.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This coming of the Holy Spirit is the first requirement for generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit came to brood over the waters of death which submerged the earth, brooding that life might be generated.</S>
