   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LABOR OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to verse 3, the labor of love comes after the work of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This labor of love is truly a labor; it is not merely an action or some kind of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It involves endeavoring, striving, working.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have pointed out that the work of faith begins with turning to God from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work of faith surely implies this kind of turning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the turning to God from idols is related to the work of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must see that serving the living God is related to the labor of love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are laboring to serve our God, who is living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We serve this living One because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Galatians 5:6 says that faith operates through love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This love is related first to serving our living God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The faith within us produces many different kinds of actions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, this faith operates in love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In love, we as believers should endeavor to serve our living God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our God is living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the living One, He speaks all the time, and we serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not easy to serve God; rather, it is a labor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul even says that it is a struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, if we would serve the living God, we must struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever God speaks in us and whatever He indicates to us, we need to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to serve Him as the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This service requires love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should first love God, and this love will cause us to labor in serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE ENDURANCE OF HOPE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, in verse 3 Paul speaks of the endurance of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No doubt, the endurance of hope in verse 3 corresponds to the waiting for the Son of God in verse 10.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have the endurance of hope, we shall wait for God's Son from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we can see what is the Christian life as a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This life originates with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the preaching of the word and our acceptance of the word, we enter into a life relationship with God the Father and have an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This comes through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then this faith works, acts, and issues in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In particular, it causes us to turn to God from everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, in love we labor, struggle, and strive to serve the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, with the endurance of hope we wait for the coming back of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This surely is a holy life, a life that is sanctified and separated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to chapter four, verse 7, God has called us in such a life, and according to chapter five, verse 23, God is now sanctifying us wholly for this kind of life so that we may have the proper church life.</S>
