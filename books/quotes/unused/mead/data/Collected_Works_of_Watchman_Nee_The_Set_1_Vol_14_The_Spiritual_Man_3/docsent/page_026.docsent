   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the mind is working, believers should be careful not to let it work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that it should not work apart from the ruling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the mind does not hold its own opinion, it helps the believers know the will of God more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when it becomes independent, it expresses the fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, many Bible studies are simply pursuits of men's own minds according to their own thoughts and by their own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people just understand the truth in their mind!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of independent action of the mind is very dangerous because this kind of knowledge will just provide more information to one's mind for his thinking and more of a basis for his boasting; however, it will have no effect at all on his life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Believers should do their best to reject all truths that have only been comprehended with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of comprehension will give Satan ground to work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believers have to awaken to the fact that any knowledge, secured by the mind alone, provides a way for the devil to work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of craving has to be restrained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mind should work; it should also rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If believers allow their mind to work without rest, it will become sick just as their physical body would.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Believers must restrain the work of the mind and not allow it to become overactive and beyond control.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Elijah's failure under the juniper tree was because his mind had been overworked 1 Kings 19:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Believers should keep the mind always in the peace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"You will keep the steadfast of mind/In perfect peace / Because he trusts in You" Isa 26:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A restless mind is a mind that is frequently disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of mind will hurt both the spiritual life and the spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will lead believers into a countless number of wrong pathways.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A restless mind cannot work according to its normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why the apostle Paul taught the believers not to allow any anxious thoughts to remain in them Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once such a thought comes in, it should be turned over to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the peace of God will keep their hearts and thoughts v. 7 . The apostle also exhorted the believers to let their mind do some work and not stay idle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "Finally, brothers, what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things" v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mind should not be dominated by the emotional life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should work by faith, understanding its principle, and be quiet and restful in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what "sobermindedness" means 2 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers should no longer depend on "voices," "visions," or "lights" as the base of their guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, they should simply follow the intuition in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They should not seek after a feeling in the emotion or use any outward stimulation, encouragement, or promise to keep them working; they should only depend on God's principle of right or wrong to determine everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mind also should be kept in humility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Haughty thoughts are very prone to bring believers into error.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All thoughts of self-justification, self-boasting, and self- satisfaction cause the mind to think improperly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many are not lacking in knowledge; however, they are deceived by themselves and become confused because their mind is too haughty, and they care too much for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, whosoever truly desires to serve the Lord must have "all humility of mind" Acts 20:19, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Believers should discard all of their self-deceiving thoughts and realize the position that God has arranged for them in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A MIND FILLED WITH THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God said, "I will impart My laws into their mind" Heb 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to read the Scripture more and memorize the Scripture more so that we do not have to search the Bible in times of urgent need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we read the Scripture, God will fill our every thought with His law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we need light for our walk, we will remember a word in the Scripture immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many believers do not like to read the Bible with their mind; they just like to flip through the Bible arbitrarily after praying and take whatever they find as being from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They do not realize that this is very unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our mind is filled with the Word of God, the Holy Spirit will enlighten our mind in an instant through the intuition and cause us to recall an appropriate verse which will show us what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not need any man to tell us not to steal because we know that this is in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This word is already in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we can be one with the Bible in this way in other matters, we will know God's will in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A CALL FOR A PURIFIED MIND</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Believers should continually ask God to purify their mind and keep it fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should ask God to wash out all our bad thoughts and vain imaginations toward God so that what we believe will be fully in accordance with the eternal will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should ask God not only to make us think about Him, but also to make us think about Him in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should ask God not to let any thought issue from our evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If there is any such thought, we should ask that God's light shine upon it and terminate it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should ask God to keep us from coming up with any special doctrines according to our old concepts, which would divide the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We also should ask God to keep us from accepting, through the mind, any special teachings that would separate us from the other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should ask God to cause us to have the same mind as others, waiting patiently in any matter that we have not arrived at a oneness of mind with others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should ask God to keep us from using the new life to sustain a wrong thought or teachings that proceed from such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should ask God to help us die not only to our evil nature, but also to our evil thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should ask God not to allow our thoughts to be the cause of division in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should ask God to keep us from being deceived again.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should ask God to cause all of His children to live by Him so that they will no longer be scattered, damaging one another and wandering about, and so that they will all have the same mind as well as the same life.</S>
