Before we consider further the line of life, we need to see another point regarding Joseph as a type of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(17) Reigning</H2><P>Joseph was a type of Christ reigning in His kingdom during the millennium. If we take note of the prophecy in the story of Joseph, we shall see that his record is a picture of Christ's reign in the millennial kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(a) Supplying People with Food</H2><P>According to this picture, Christ will do four things during the millennium. First, He will supply people with food, that is, He will satisfy everyone's needs (47:15-17). Although the whole earth was under a famine, Joseph was able to satisfy everyone's hunger. Today everyone is hungry and no one is satisfied. But when Christ is reigning during the coming thousand years, He will meet everyone's need and satisfy everyone's hunger.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(b) Keeping People Alive</H2><P>As Joseph was reigning in Egypt, he kept people alive (47:19, 25). Because Christ will satisfy everyone's needs, He will be able to make everyone alive, to make everyone living. If you examine the prophecies regarding Christ's reign in the millennium, you will see that Christ will make everything living. Today, death is everywhere; everyone and everything is dying. But during the millennial reign of Christ, there will be hardly a sign of death. Rather, everything and everyone will be full of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(c) Keeping the Land Producing</H2><P>Joseph also kept the land producing. He gave the people not only food, but also seed (47:19-23). In the millennium Christ will make everything productive. In today's situation, on the contrary, everything is diminishing. But when the millennium comes, everything on earth will be productive. In order to produce, we must have seed. While food is for satisfaction, seed is for production. As He reigns in the millennium, Christ will not only afford people food to satisfy them, but supply them with seed to make them productive.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_678.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_680.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 679</div><br></body></html>
