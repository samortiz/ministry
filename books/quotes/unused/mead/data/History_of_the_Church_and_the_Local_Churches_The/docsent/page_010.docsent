   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING COMPLETELY APART FROM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY, AND HIERARCHY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I want to point out again that the church is completely apart from religion, philosophy, and hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to understand what religion is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Religion is worshipping God, serving God, and doing something for God without Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What we do may be quite good, fundamental, and scriptural, but if what we do is without Christ as the life-giving Spirit, that is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There also should be no philosophy in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philosophy refers to the human thought, the human concept, and the human understanding which is embodied in the human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This philosophy is always expressed in different doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Doctrine can be a cloak to human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Something may appear to be a scriptural doctrine when actually it is the expression of a person's thought, opinion, or Christian philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It can actually be one's self-made philosophy under the cloak of scriptural teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to be careful not to use our mind apart from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to be afraid of our natural concept, thought, and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The natural understanding is really poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the churches the most blessed persons are the simple ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ones who are not blessed are the ones who are so much in the exercise of their natural mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to realize that our mentality is the ground where the tree of knowledge grows to produce all kinds of fruit of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 4:14 warns us not to be carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The dividing teachings are organized and systematized by Satan to cause serious error and thus damage the practical oneness of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan utilizes the Bible teachings to systematize people and to bring them into systematized error.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to be aware of the natural concepts and thoughts behind the winds of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means we have to reject the philosophies of men and the teachings that distract us from Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, we should reject any thought or practice of rank and position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rank and hierarchy come from the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a brother is an elder, he should not have a pleasant feeling when people call him an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not so good to call a brother an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We want to avoid any concept of rank within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The term elder is not and should not be a title.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not have the title elder among us, but we have some persons who are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not have any positions or titles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to hate hierarchy Rev 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is an insult to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a shame that clergymen are referred to as "reverend."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only Christ is reverend.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only He should receive our reverence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church there should be no religion, no philosophy, no vain doctrines or teachings, and no hierarchy, clergy, rank, positions, or titles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the problems, confusion, and divisions come from these sources.</S>
