   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Psalm 119 speaks directly about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this psalm the word "testimonies" is used twenty-two times, and the word "testimony" is used once.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This psalm also speaks many times about the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is true to say that the law typifies Christ as a portrait of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why the law is called the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law is a portrait of God, and eventually this portrait is not merely the Ten Commandments but a living person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the law of God, the portrait of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is also the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Psalm 119, which closes something and also opens something, there is no further revelation in the Psalms concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we see Christ, we should ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, after Psalm 119 we have the psalms of ascents, indicating that the Christian life is a life of ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What kind of interest do you have in knowing the Psalms?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are you interested in coming to the Psalms to learn about godliness or to find comfort?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians love the Psalms because they contain instruction concerning godliness and words of comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sixty years ago I also loved the Psalms in this way, but today my love for the Psalms is different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I love the Psalms because this book is full of revelation concerning Christ which we cannot see in other books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The four Gospels give us a fourfold record of what Christ is and of what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the Gospels do not reveal Christ as much as the Psalms do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes the Psalms are quoted in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, Psalm 118:22-23 is quoted in Matthew 21:42, and Psalm 110:1 is quoted in Matthew 22:44.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without the Psalms we cannot have a clear view concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you consider all the points regarding Christ in the Psalms, you will see that the Psalms present us a particular picture of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The title of this message on Psalms 111 through 118 is "The Praise of God's Elect Consummating in the Particular Position of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This group of psalms may be called "psalms of hallelujahs."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalms 111, 112, and 113 all begin with the word "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These psalms, therefore, are psalms of praises to God, and these praises consummate in a particular position of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that Psalm 118 does not come out of nothing but is the issue of the praises of God's elect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we consider these psalms, we will see that the praises in them are different from the praises in the foregoing psalms.</S>
