   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD HAVING A UNIQUE MEANS FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS REVELATION IN EVERY AGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some among us have been accused of following one man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Recently a number of leading brothers all expressed to me that they felt they must follow this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time I was burdened to tell them, To declare that you follow someone is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is entirely not a matter of following a man or not following a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is altogether a matter of where the present revelation is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we were born and lived in Noah s age, we would have needed to follow Noah, because he had God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from Noah, we could not have had the revelation of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If someone had said, I do not follow Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will follow someone else, then he would have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I am speaking for my own sake, I must be stopped, but I am not speaking for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please read your Bible again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In every age, in every generation, there was only one means for the revelation in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Noah, Moses, and David were the unique means in their age, and Peter, Paul, and eventually John, in the book of Revelation, became the unique means of God s up-to-date revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I strongly declare that when I was with Brother Watchman Nee, I respected him not because he was good but because he was the unique means of God s revelation in that time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In every age God had and still has one unique means for His up-to-date revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE MINISTRY IN THE PRESENT AGE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was through this ministry that the Lord s recovery was brought to this country, and many have received help from it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regrettably, though, some have utilized the materials of this ministry to establish a church in their own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They declare, We are the local church here, but they are not a genuine local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because that church is not open, it is a church not of the saints but of someone s private concern.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not the church the Lord desires today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the church of someone s own work and a church for that work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is someone s pocket version of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the churches in Los Angeles and Anaheim, we never closed the door to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whoever wished to come to us was able to.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would speak a word to the dear ones who keep the churches as their pocket church : Will you open the door of your church to everyone?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you will, I will be the first to speak an approving word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, I am afraid such a church will reject this ministry, accusing me of trying to be a pope to control them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have no intention to be the pope, but those who keep this kind of church do have the intention to be a king in their empire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I labored closely with Watchman Nee, so he told me things he could not tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He suffered much, because some were accusing him, saying, You are trying to be a pope, using your ministry, your gift, your messages, and your knowledge of the Bible to control all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee told me, Only robbers always suspect others of robbing them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You know that we have no thought of controlling others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are able to think this way only because they are the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they were in our position, they would surely be popes to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because they are robbers, they think we are robbing others too.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some have accused me also of trying to set up a papal system and of putting out messages to control all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I never had such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can the dear ones have such a concept?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It may be because they are robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If such ones were in my situation, they might set up such a papal system.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who have been in the church life for many years can declare to the entire universe that I have controlled nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, in every age there is a means for God s up-to-date revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The things this ministry is speaking are unique.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This ministry today is burdened directly for the Lord s present revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the Lord would not give me something to minister, there is no need to pick up something old from the other books.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those things are out of date.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They might have been good one or two centuries ago, or even fifty years ago, but they are not good for the present revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Anyone can compare our messages with the other books to see that all the points in our messages are unique.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This revelation is from the Lord, not from me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why I have the full assurance that if anyone opposes this ministry, he will suffer the loss of the Lord s revelation today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am forced by the present situation to speak in such a way in order to warn you not to listen to and be poisoned by critical and divisive speakings that damage our one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have no intention to control anyone, and we are not qualified to control anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to their natural thought, some believe that I control the church in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1965, the brother helping me to file my income tax asked me if I knew how much money had been given to me in the previous year by the church in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I told him that I do not pay attention to such things, he told me the amount, which was a very small figure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This illustrates that this ministry has no intention of controlling anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This ministry cares only to minister the Lord s burden in His present revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some saints have been listening to my messages for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many of them considered that eventually I would have no more new messages and that I would simply repeat my old ones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, throughout all the years, our conferences have never been a mere repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is always something new.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is due to the Lord s mercy and grace, because this is not my ministry but His.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since 1950, every time I visited Manila the brothers there have asked me to hold a conference, and every time the Lord has given me something new.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One elderly sister testified that she was surprised when I came with new messages.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She said, I am a third generation Christian, but I have never heard the terms you spoke in your message.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please tell me where you found these new things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I told her, After coming here for so many years, you should have realized where I receive my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do not get them from a seminary or merely from bookshelves or a reference Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I receive my messages from only one source the One on the throne that flows out the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>THERE BEING ONE FLOW FROM THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>AND ONE SOUNDING OF THE TRUMPET</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the entire universe there is only one flow, but whether anyone follows the messages from this flow is up to him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I have declared this for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The first message I published in the first issue of The Stream, on July 1, 1963, was entitled The Divine Stream, concerning the one flow on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This was the reason that I chose the name of the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The stream is the unique flow from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the entire universe there is only one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We can see this in the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After the day of Pentecost the one flow flowed from Jerusalem to Antioch, and from Antioch the flow turned to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since Barnabas had brought Paul into the Lord s ministry, he may have thought that he could dissent against him Acts 15:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, after he separated from Paul, there is no further record in Acts concerning his work.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is because he left the one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I am forced to speak concerning my ministry in this way, not for my sake but for the sake of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whoever rejects this ministry rejects not a small man from China but the flow from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This ministry has only one burden, which is to build today s ark, not only to save the saints from God s eternal judgment but also to save them from the crooked and perverted generation of today so that they may express God in a corporate way, be ushered into the coming kingdom, and exercise His authority in the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the purpose, the burden, and the goal of this ministry as God s unique means for His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God would not send out trumpeters to sound different trumpets for His army to fight the battle 1 Cor 14:8; Num 10:9; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This would be confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God is wiser than this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He will raise up only one trumpeter to sound one calling, one voice, so that His people on the earth can march on.</S>
