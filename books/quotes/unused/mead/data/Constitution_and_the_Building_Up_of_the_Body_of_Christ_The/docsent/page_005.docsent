   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. As the Sower</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Distributor of the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all know that Jesus Christ loves us and that He came to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is good that He is a Savior, but He is more than a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He told us that He is the Sower Matt 13:3, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A sower sows the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, as the Sower the Lord Jesus is the Distributor of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He came that we might have life and have it abundantly John 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But by what way did He come that we might have life?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was by His coming and sowing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Sower, the Distributor of the divine life, and because He has sown Himself into us, we all have this life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is it to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may say that to be saved is to be forgiven of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This answer is correct, but it is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be saved is not merely this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be saved is to get Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. To Sow to Impart, to Dispense Himself</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Sower distributes the divine life into us by sowing, imparting, and dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not merely sow, but He also imparted the divine life, to make sure that He got into you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And He did not merely impart, but He also dispenses the divine life in a fine way bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the day you were saved, Christ has been dispensing the divine life bit by bit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He cannot dispense too much into you at one time; otherwise, you would "burst."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. As the Life Seed of Wheat, Signifying the Word</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ sows, imparts, and dispenses Himself as the life seed of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life seed of wheat signifies the word Matt 13:3, 19-23; Mark 4:14; John 6:68 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day the Lord Jesus saw Peter fishing, and He spoke something to him: "Come after Me" Matt 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then Peter came, and he was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From that day on Jesus could never get out of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By His word He imparts Himself into us as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A seed is precious and tiny.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But after it has been sown into the earth for two or three months, something comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the seed's growing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So it is also with Christ: first, He came; then, He sowed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He sowed Himself as the life seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>INTO THE HUMAN HEART AS THE GROWING EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the seed, and He sowed Himself into our heart Matt 13:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The human heart is the growing earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In farming, the seed is planted into the earth and is mingled with the element of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The seed grows together with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This produces the plant.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ has sown Himself into us, and both He and we grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He as the life seed has a certain kind of element, and we as the growing earth also have a certain kind of element, and the two mingle together and grow together to be one plant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the Body of Christ constituted with the divine life mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today there is so much talk about what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But mostly this is doctrinal talk.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The real Body, the Body of Christ in reality, is a plant growing out of Christ as the life seed sown into the human heart as the growing earth.</S>
