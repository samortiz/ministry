   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SCENE OF BRONZE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When in our experience we enter into the outer court of the tabernacle, we find that the most striking element is bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we look around, we see sixty pillars of bronze and sixty sockets of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, 27:19 says, All the utensils of the tabernacle in all its service, and all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court shall be of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pegs are for holding the fence of the outer court and also for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 19 indicates that there were two sets of pegs, one for the tabernacle and the other for the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even these pegs were made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The altar of burnt offering and the laver were also covered with bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, whoever came into the outer court beheld a scene of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This scene filled with bronze portrays the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s judgment can be seen everywhere in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything in the realm of God s building is under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everything related to us must be put under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our cleverness and all our natural ability, to say nothing of our shortcomings, need to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have pointed out that the utensils, the furniture, and the pegs in the outer court, along with the pillars and the sockets, were of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The pegs signify the standing and holding power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This power is of bronze, of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would have a solid base in God s building, we must be under judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would have the standing strength, we must also be under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to be strong and stable, we need to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we are under God s judgment, the more stable we shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>STABILIZING THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you know why certain saints come into the church life and after a short period of time become unstable and then disappear?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason for their instability is that they do not have the bronze pegs; they lack God s judgment as their strength and stability.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the day a saint comes into the church life, he should place himself under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then he will be strong and stable in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Judgment truly stabilizes the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some brothers and sisters criticize others and condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In particular, the elders in a local church are often condemned by the critical ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who criticize others are not under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are under the judgment of God day by day, we shall not be critical of others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We shall not judge them or condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who judge others are those who have not been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But those who have been judged do not judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can testify with a pure conscience that I judge myself much more than I judge anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I am tempted to talk about the shortcomings of anyone else, I become conscious of a sense of judgment within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This inner sense causes me to realize that I am not better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, I am worse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that many of us have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being judged closes our judging, criticizing mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we are not under judgment, it will be easy for us to speak critical or judging words regarding others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I would encourage you to consider the scenery of the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a scene filled with bronze, with God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everywhere we see bronze signifying judgment: bronze sockets, bronze pillars, bronze pegs, bronze furniture, bronze utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without judgment, there is no boundary, no base, no strength for standing, and no stability.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>JUDGMENT AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we have seen, Christ s redemption comes out of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Redemption is signified by the silver overlaying the caps, the capitals, of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the pillars of the fence of the court were overlaid on their caps with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These capitals overlaid with silver signify glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, Christ s redemption coming out of God s judgment becomes our crown, our boast, our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the significance of the silver capitals on top of the bronze pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, there were the silver hooks, the silver connecting rods, and the silver sockets for the tenons of the standing boards of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This signifies that the redemption of Christ becomes the solid foundation for the standing of all the members of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What a beautiful picture we have here!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First we see God s judgment and then Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The redemption of Christ becomes our crown, our holding power, our connecting strength.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It also becomes our foundation on which to stand as members of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the judgment of God bringing forth the redemption of Christ, the bronze bringing forth the silver.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>BRONZE, SILVER, AND GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Following the bronze and the silver, we have gold.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By the bronze, we enter into the court.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then through the silver, we enter into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Holy Place, and especially in the Holy of Holies, everything is of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This signifies that the divine nature is our portion, our enjoyment, and our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everything in the tabernacle is gold: golden boards, golden utensils, a golden showbread table, a golden lampstand, and a golden incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Holy of Holies we have the golden ark with the golden cherubim and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everything inside the tabernacle is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, bronze brings forth silver, and silver brings us into the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This signifies that everything must be judged in order to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then after we have been redeemed, we are brought into the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is our destiny, our destination; it is also our portion, enjoyment, and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once we are brought into the gold, we should stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even we need to touch the very depths in the Holy of Holies and to be with God, and also to become one with Him.</S>
