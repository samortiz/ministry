   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Jeremiah's Petition for Jehovah's Care</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Jehovah's Answer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with a Further Commission to Him</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jeremiah responded to Jehovah's speaking by petitioning Him for His care.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"O Jehovah, You know; / Remember me and visit me, / And avenge me of my persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ In Your longsuffering do not take me away; / Know that for Your sake I bear reproach" v. 15 . By using the word know in his petition, Jeremiah seemed to be reminding God concerning his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jeremiah's petition indicates that no matter how strong and spiritual he might have been, he was still human.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As he asked God to remember him and visit him, he seemed to be saying, "O Jehovah, do not forget me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not give me up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I need You to remember me, to visit me, and to avenge me of those who are persecuting me for Your sake."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In particular, Jeremiah prayed that, in His longsuffering, Jehovah would not take him away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jeremiah seemed to be saying, "Jehovah, You are a God who can suffer a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I ask that in Your longsuffering You do not allow my persecutors to kill me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are kind and compassionate, and You may allow my persecutors to go on doing evil things for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I ask that, during the time of Your longsuffering, You will not allow my persecutors to take my life."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The next verse v. 16 is very unusual and does not seem to fit here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this verse Jeremiah says, "Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The joy and rejoicing of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, O Jehovah, God of hosts."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the entire revelation in the Holy Bible, God's words are good for us to eat, and we need to eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we eat God's words, His word becomes our heart's joy and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this verse Jeremiah says not only that he found and ate God's words but also that he was called by Jehovah's name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Hebrew words translated "I am called by Your name" may also be rendered "Your name is called over me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In either case, Jeremiah was saying that he belonged to Jehovah and was under His name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 17 Jeremiah goes on to say, "I did not sit in the assembly of mockers, nor did I exult.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>/ Because of Your hand I sat alone, / For You have filled me with indignation."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word mockers here does not denote despisers but those who mock others by rejoicing in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such mockers were probably mocking Jeremiah, who did not exult and who was not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, because Jehovah's hand was upon Jeremiah, he sat alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jehovah's hand held him down and constrained him to sit quietly and endure the mocking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Jeremiah was quiet, he was filled with indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was impossible for him to have joy or to rejoice.</S>
