   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FRUSTRATING OF PECULIARITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me say something in a brief and clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why do we talk so much about peculiarity?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because this one thing frustrates us from the experience of Christ and from the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two matters have been frustrated to the uttermost by our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank Him that we have been and still are the Lord s seekers in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even the angels cannot deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may say: Sometimes I don t love the Lord so much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I would say that is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe all of you love the Lord, and we are all seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not of ourselves; this is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We love Him, we seek after Him, and we come to the meetings to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we all have to admit after a certain number of years in the recovery, our advance, our progress, our growth has become quite slow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first two or three years of our church-life experience, the speed was very high but not today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not stopped completely; we are still driving, but the speed is too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is easy to turn to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Overnight you can turn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To get into the church life is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Tonight you turn and tomorrow you come to the meetings and begin to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You begin to meet in the Name, and you begin to stand on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are happy, and you begin to function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After all this, however, the highway is climbing up and up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After all this you need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To grow in life is just to experience more and more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the initial stage of our church life we turned this way very fast, we stood on the ground of oneness very fast, and we practiced the church life very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After all these matters we have come to the point that the highway is not so flat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The highway began to go up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After all these years, you now need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After all the things we have done we now need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have reached a state where we must experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without this we become jobless in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You know the church-life doctrine, and you are familiar with the church-life practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What else do you need?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE NEED TO GROW</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before 1973 many among us thought it would be good to go to a new place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There they would be busy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now even though they went somewhere else, still they ask: What else?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Still they have nothing to do because the main thing they need is to grow in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They need to experience Christ directly and purely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we don t experience Christ directly in our present state we all become jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What has caused us to become jobless?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not sin, but peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I thank the Lord that in Orange County at least a thousand saints have been brought to this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If these dear saints don t grow in life they all become jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To take the ground of oneness doesn t mean so much to them because they have it already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, when some young ones graduated from elementary school, they were proud.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose, however, they did not go on to study in high school.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After three years their graduation from elementary school would mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After graduation from high school, or even from college, or from a master s degree or a Ph.D., if you don t keep studying further and further, after a certain time you will feel jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why do some in the churches feel that they are now jobless, with nothing to do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They had a good start in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was so good at Elden Hall.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Comparatively speaking, they might say that today the church is not as good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I would say that I don t believe this is the case.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church has never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would say the church today is much better than Elden.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church has not changed, but you have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You are like the southern California climate you have a lot of fluctuations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church stands the same and even rather is going on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even the angels would say that the recovery in the United States is much stronger and richer than it was seventeen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You say Elden was better simply because you haven t grown.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You didn t grow, and you have become jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you don t grow in Christ, you have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you don t grow in life, there is no possibility of having even a little bit of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So of course you become jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Recently the church in Anaheim has been promoting gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Of course, gospel preaching is quite an activity; it is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you haven t grown in life and if you don t have some amount of building, you would not go along with the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whatever the church does, you would not go along because you are behind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>So you are jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those who are growing and being built are all the time one with the church in any kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Peculiarity eats up the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is a germ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is even a serious disease like tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is a strong, hard germ with hard wax covering it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>So it is hard to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This germ not only eats up the experience of Christ, but also keeps people from being built up in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You may be in the local church, but you are not being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What keeps you from the building?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The peculiarity eats up your experience of Christ, and without the experience of Christ, there is no way for you to be built up.</S>
