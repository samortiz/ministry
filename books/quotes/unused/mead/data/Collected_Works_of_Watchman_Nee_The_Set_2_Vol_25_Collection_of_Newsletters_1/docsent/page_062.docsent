   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANSWER TO BROTHER HSU CHUNG CHIEH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Chung Chieh:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In regard to your first kind of spiritual condition, it is not good, nor is it bad.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This kind of condition is completely transitory in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I dare not say whether you will get through it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It depends on whether or not you are hungry and whether or not you are faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The condition you described is the condition of the first transitional step in passing through the separation of the soul from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being inwardly calm and outwardly confused is not a bad condition, but being outwardly calm is an even better condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Meditation and planning are completely vain when you rely on yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when you rely on God, they are not completely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you have learned to completely rely on God, you can both pray and meditate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You can pray and plan things at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since your mind is still in rebellion, you feel that using your mind is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When your mind has completely obeyed, your conscience will not condemn you for using it, and it will not consider using your mind as relying on yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the book The Spiritual Man I said the soulish life should be rejected, but the organ of the soul can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in this transitional stage, you have this kind of condition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you have passed through this gate, your mind will be obedient to God and not rebel against what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You can use it when you pray and not be controlled by it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Presently, you can ignore the other feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You should pray thoroughly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should pray with faith and learn to rely on Him, to only look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By faith, you should acknowledge Him as the only One who can help you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You should learn to unload yourself before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the Holy Spirit will give you power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You only have to do your part; He will do His part.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother, please remember, you cannot know or feel the strengthening of the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can only pray and trust.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will work without your being aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The question of whether the most intimate aspect of the self can completely be removed depends on what you mean by the question.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you mean that you will not feel that you have yourself again, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as we are on this earth, we will feel the existence of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the more the Holy Spirit operates in us, the more we will be aware of the existence of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are living souls.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The soul gives us our self-consciousness and makes us feel that we are ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, as long as we are men, we have self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Watchman Nee</S>
