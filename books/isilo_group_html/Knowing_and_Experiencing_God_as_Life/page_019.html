<h1 class="title">HOW TO MAINTAIN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:5-9; 2:27-28; 3:20-21, 24; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 2 Tim. 1:3</h1>
<p>In the experience of God as life, there are several matters that are necessary in order for us to maintain our fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CLEANSING OF THE BLOOD</h2>
<p>The first necessary item is the cleansing of the blood. First John 1:5 says, &ldquo;God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.&rdquo; If we commune with God, fellowship with Him, and live in Him in a deeper way, we will be in the light, not in darkness. Light is for manifesting; the stronger the light becomes, the stronger its manifesting power becomes. At night we cannot see what is in a dark room. If we want to see what is in the room, we must turn on the light. During the day, when there is sufficient light, we can see everything in the room. However, if there is insufficient light, we will not be able to see any dust that is in the air. If the sun shines directly into the room, everything in the room will be manifested. Hence, light is for manifesting.</p>
<p>God as light has the same kind of manifesting power in us. The more we fellowship with Him and live in Him, the more His shining power will increase and intensify, and the various defilements in our being will be exposed. For this reason, 1 John 1 says that if we fellowship with God, we will be in the light, and we will see our sins (vv. 6-9). Before we receive the shining, we do not feel that we have any sins. But once we live in God, who is light, we will immediately be in the light, and all our mistakes, sins, defilements, and uncleannesses will spontaneously be exposed by the light. Some people may not feel that they have made many mistakes, but as soon as they enter into God&rsquo;s light, they will discover that they were wrong in many matters. Not only so, if they spend time in the light, their thoughts, intentions, desires, attitudes, and disposition will not remain hidden but will be examined under the shining of the light.</p>
<p>I once took my children to a science museum. The guide had a glass of what appeared to be clean water without any dirt. He took a drop of the water, put it on a glass slide, placed the slide under a microscope, and used a strong light to project an image of the slide on the wall. We were shocked because we saw many bacteria moving in the water.</p>
<p>Hence, whether or not a thing can be seen depends on the intensity of the shining it receives. The fact that many things cannot be seen does not mean that they do not exist; rather, it means that there is not enough light. If there is sufficient light, all things will be manifested. This applies not only to things in the physical world but also to spiritual things. We should not think that by not sinning or doing anything evil, we are good persons, and there is nothing wrong with our speech or conduct. If we enter into the light, many hidden things will be exposed. The light will manifest our living, conduct, speech, intentions, thoughts, motives, and attitudes. The closer we draw to God and the more we live in Him, the more our sins will be exposed by the light.</p>
<p>If we do not contact God, we will not know our true condition. When we take God as life and have deeper fellowship with Him, we are filled with light that exposes our sins. When our sins are exposed, our conscience immediately condemns us before God. This is when we need the cleansing of the blood. The first thing we need after we receive the shining of light is the cleansing of the blood. This is the fellowship of life in 1 John 1. God is light; hence, when we live in Him, we are exposed and our sins are manifested. At this time, we need the blood of His Son, the Lord Jesus, to cleanse us (v. 7).</p>
<p>No one knows the preciousness of the blood better than a person who lives by God&rsquo;s life. The more we fellowship with God, the more we will know the preciousness of the blood. As humans, we are born in the flesh, we grow up in sin, and we live in the world. Outwardly we are defiled, and inwardly we are corrupt. After we are saved, we still have the nature of the old creation, and we still live in the defiled world; hence, it is impossible for us not to be contaminated by sin. Only when we are away from God and without light can we say that we do not have sin. Those who say this are deceived and in darkness, because they are full of sin but without the feeling of sin (v. 8). Some saints like to criticize others and the church; they always find fault in others, but they never find any fault in themselves. Such a condition proves that they are in darkness.</p>
<p>One night while I was in my house, I noticed that the neighboring house was full of light. When I turned off the light in my room, I was in complete darkness and could not see myself, but I could see my neighbor very clearly. Whenever we do not sense that we are wrong but see others&rsquo; faults clearly and criticize them, we are in darkness.</p>
<p>In contrast, if our house is flooded with light, but our neighbor&rsquo;s house is in darkness, we will not be able to see his condition; instead, we will see only our condition. Similarly, when we live in God, our entire being will be in the light, and we will see our sins. Before the rapture, we cannot reach a condition of being shined on by God yet having no consciousness of sin. Even if we do not commit any obvious sins, there will still be something in us that is incompatible with God. He is our life, and we are His vessel. Nevertheless, we are inadequate in our coordination and in our cooperating with Him. Hence, when we come into His light, our conscience will condemn us concerning many things. At this time, we will sense the need for the precious blood and apply its effectiveness. Thus, we realize that a person lives in God not only by His life but also through the blood. The blood enables us to maintain our fellowship with God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
