   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul speaks of a second divine provision in 8:14: For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse we have the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some Christians have received inaccurate teachings concerning the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may think that in order to have the Spirit s leading they need to follow a certain procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the genuine leading of the Spirit is within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that in our spirit there is a divine provision called the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A divine Person, the Spirit of God, indwells us, and this indwelling Spirit is now leading us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose a young brother is considering what to do on the weekend.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He may desire to engage in a certain kind of worldly amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But within him there is Someone the Spirit leading him, and this One does not agree with that desire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, there is a struggle within this young brother, a struggle between his own desire and the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although he cannot see the invisible Spirit, he can sense the Spirit s leading within him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would even say that he can sense not only the Spirit s leading, but also the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Deep within, this brother may sense the Spirit saying, You want to do that thing, but I don t agree with you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should go to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that we have a Leader in us, and this Leader is the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we have the indwelling Spirit leading us, we are not under the control of some powerful person who exerts a strong influence upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, we have a divine Leader, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit, leading us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of us can testify that we experience the leading of the Spirit even in such a small matter as a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our church life we do not have a regulation which says that the brothers should have their hair cut in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of regulations, we have the indwelling Spirit leading us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose a young brother wants to have his hair cut in a particular way, but the leading Spirit within him does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brother wants to keep his hair rather long, but the Spirit prefers that it be cut short.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this brother does not care for the Spirit s leading and offends Him, he will have no joy within him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will not be able to sing that song concerning being happy in the splendid church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if he has his hair cut according to the leading of the indwelling Spirit, he will have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he comes out of the barbershop, he may find himself singing about the splendid church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the result of following the leading of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can we know that we are sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that we are sons of God because we are led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This leading is not accidental or occasional.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, the leading of the Spirit should be habitual, constant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Continuously in our daily life we should be led by the divine Indweller.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are led by the Spirit all day long, then we are living as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we not only are sons of God, but we are actually living as sons of God in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a brother needs to get a haircut, there is no need for him to pray for the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This brother does not need to say, Lord, I m going to the barbershop to get a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How long should my hair be?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, show me the right length for my hair.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead of praying like this, the brother should simply go to the barbershop according to the Spirit s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because he has the leading of the indwelling Spirit, he will know spontaneously how he should have his hair cut.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Have you not had similar experiences?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We not only have the law of the Spirit of life within us we also have the leading of the Spirit.</S>
