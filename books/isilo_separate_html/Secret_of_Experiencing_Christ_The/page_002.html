Christ is the focus, the center, of the entire Bible. The Bible unveils Him to us that we may experience Him. God's eternal plan depends upon Him. He is the central person, the central figure, in the Bible. As Christians, we must experience Him day by day. If in a particular day we do not experience Christ, that day is in vain. The Christian life is one of experiencing Christ at all times. If we would experience Christ, we need to see what is the secret of experiencing Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECEIVING THE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE PERSON OF CHRIST</H2><P>In order to experience Christ, we first need to receive the revelation concerning His Person. Both the Bible and the entire history of mankind tell us that Christ is a wonderful Person. In the six thousand year history of mankind there has never been a Person as wonderful as Christ. He is not only wonderful, but also mysterious. No historian can deny that in human history there was such a mysterious Person as Jesus Christ. Christ is mysterious because no one can tell where He came from and where He went. No historian can tell us where Jesus Christ is today. Yet He is believed in, exalted, worshipped, and praised by millions of His believers on this earth. Although none of them has ever seen Him with his eyes, all of His believers love Him and many would even die for Him (1 Pet. 1:8). Many have given their lives for this Christ. He is a mystery which no human words can explain.</P><P>To receive the revelation concerning Christ, we must come to the Bible. In the Bible human language is used to describe Christ. Although He is mysterious, divine, and spiritual, the Bible uses human words to tell us who He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPLETE GOD</H2><P>First the Bible tells us that Christ is the complete God. Romans 9:5 says that "Christ...is over all, God blessed forever." In the entire universe there is only one God (Isa. 45:5; 1 Cor. 8:4; 1 Tim. 2:5). This unique God is real, true, and living. Christ Himself is this very God. Christ is the complete God, not merely a part of God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
