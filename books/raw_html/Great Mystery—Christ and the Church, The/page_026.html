        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6, 11-24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians is a book on the church; it reveals the church and presents the way to experience the church, which is to experience Christ. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ. God is a mystery, and Christ is also a mystery. Nothing in the universe is as mysterious as God, and no one in history was as mysterious as Christ. Christ is God, and He became a man; hence, He is both God and man. As a man, He possesses two lives and two natures. He has the divine life and the divine nature as well as the human life and human nature. Our mind cannot comprehend how a person can have two lives and two natures, nor can our mind comprehend how Christ can be both God and man. This does not mean that Christ ceased being God when He became a man. Rather, Christ is both God and man. This mystery has been manifested in the church because the church is the mystery of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God (3:4-6; Col. 2:2).</p>
<p>God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. Many Christians do not know that the church is a mystery. They think that the church is a physical building with a cross on it. However, according to the divine revelation, the church is not a physical building; it is as mysterious as Christ, and Christ is as mysterious as God. God, Christ, and the church are three great mysteries. Those who are in the church are in a mystery. As believers, there is something mysterious in our being, and this mystery is Christ and God. Since we are the church, we have Christ and we have God.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 says that this mystery includes the unsearchable riches of Christ (vv. 3-8). These riches have been dispensed into us. We have received the dispensing of the riches of Christ. Paul calls this dispensing the economy of the mystery (v. 9). The economy of the mystery is the dispensing of the mystery; God dispenses the mystery that is in Himself into us. Something mysterious has been dispensed into the children of God. Regrettably, many Christians do not know about the dispensing of the mystery, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we both know and experience the dispensing of the mystery.</p>
<p>Through the dispensing, the riches of Christ are constantly and mysteriously imparted into us. I can testify that this dispensing is imparting Christ into me moment by moment. Furthermore, I have the assurance that all the saints are experiencing this dispensing. The dispensing of the mystery produces the church; that is, the church is produced out of this dispensing. The producing of the church is mysterious and spiritual, for the church is produced out of the divine life. The dispensing is not physical or fleshly; rather, it is the Triune God dispensing His unsearchable riches into all those who believe in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 says that the church is the fullness of God (v. 19). The fullness of God does not refer to the riches of God but to the overflowing of these riches. Suppose water is poured into a cup until it overflows. The water that overflows is the fullness, the expression, of the water. Likewise, the church is the fullness of God; the church is the overflowing of God, the expression of God. As Christians, we have the privilege of being filled with the Triune God so that He can overflow from within us. This overflow is the fullness of God, the manifestation of God, and the expression of God, which is the church.</p>
<p>The church is the expression of God. We cannot use something physical as an illustration of the church, because the church is mysterious. The church is the flowing within us. When we are filled with God and He overflows from within us, we are the church.</p>
<p>If each of us is not filled with God until He overflows, He will not flow out when we gather together. This is the experience of many Christians; they do not have much Christ in them. Hence, He does not flow out when they sing or pray. We should not be such Christians. Whether we are singing, praying, or praising, we should allow God to flow out. He should flow out in everything that we do. This is the church. The church is the fullness of God, the flowing out of God from within man.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that Ephesians 3 speaks of seven great items: the mystery of Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ; the economy of the mystery; the church; Christ making His home in our hearts; the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ, which are His immeasurable dimensions; and the fullness of God. Paul wrote chapter 3 according to these seven crucial items. The young people should memorize, understand, and experience these seven items. These seven items tell us what the church is. The church is the mystery of Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ, and the economy of the mystery of God. The church is Christ making His home in our hearts and our experiencing the immeasurable Christ until we become the fullness of God, the expression of God. This is the church. It is wonderful and glorious.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
