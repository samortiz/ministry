<h1 class="title">A Revelation of God&rsquo;s Economy&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I&rdquo; Crucified in Christ&rsquo;s Death,<br />
and Christ Living in Me in His Resurrection</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:19-20; 1 Cor. 6:17; John 14:19; 15:4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Paul wrote the book of Galatians both according to truth and according to experience&mdash;2:5, 14; 4:16; 5:7; 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19.</li>
<li>The Christian life is a life of organic oneness with Christ&mdash;John 15:4; Gal. 2:19-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God desires that the divine life and the human life be joined to become one life; this oneness is a union in life&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The Christian life is not an exchanged life&mdash;the exchange of a lower life for a higher one&mdash;but a grafted life&mdash;the grafting of the human life into the divine life and the mingling of the human life with the divine life&mdash;Rom. 11:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In grafting, two similar lives are joined and then grow together organically; in the process of spiritual grafting, two lives&mdash;the divine life and the human life&mdash;are grafted and become one&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:7.</li>
		<li>In order for us to be grafted into Christ, He had to pass through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit&mdash;John 1:14; Matt. 1:1; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>When the preciousness of the Lord Jesus was infused into us and we began to appreciate Him, we were grafted into Him; we were joined to Christ in His resurrection and were organically united with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By believing into Christ and being baptized into Him, we have been grafted into Him&mdash;John 3:15; Gal. 3:27.</li>
			<li>We have been grafted into the One who is the seed to fulfill God&rsquo;s promise and also the life-giving Spirit as the blessing of the good land&mdash;vv. 16, 14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As regenerated ones, we should live a grafted life&mdash;John 15:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>After we have been grafted into Christ, we should no longer live by ourselves; rather, we should allow the pneumatic Christ to live in us&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
			<li>We should no longer live by our flesh or by our natural being; instead, we should live by our regenerated spirit, a spirit grafted with Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the grafted life, the divine life works to discharge the negative elements and to resurrect our God-created being&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.</li>
		<li>Through this grafting, we are united, mingled, and incorporated with Christ to become in Him an enlarged, universal, divine and human incorporation&mdash;the Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; John 15:4; 14:20; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the organic union with Christ, we have the experience of being dead to the law and alive to God&mdash;Gal. 2:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be dead to the law means to be discharged from the law in which we were held; to live to God means to be obligated to God in the divine life&mdash;Rom. 7:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Christ&rsquo;s death our obligation under the law has been terminated&mdash;v. 4a.</li>
		<li>In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we are responsible to God in the resurrection life&mdash;v. 4b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we are not actually organically united with Christ but are in ourselves, then we are neither dead to the law nor alive to God&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 2:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be dead to the law and alive to God implies the death and resurrection of Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:3-5; Col. 2:12.</li>
		<li>Only by being grafted into Christ to have an organic union with Him can we be one with Him in His death and resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the organic union with Christ, His history becomes our history&mdash;Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>One aspect of our history includes the crucifixion by which we have been cut off from everything other than God&mdash;6:14.</li>
		<li>Another aspect of our history includes the resurrection in which we have been united with the Triune God&mdash;Rom. 6:5; Matt. 28:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we are cut off from the law by means of the organic union with Christ, we spontaneously live to God&mdash;Gal. 2:19.</li>
	<li>Because we and Christ are one, whatever belongs to Him is ours; through our organic union with Him, we share whatever He is and has&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Galatians 2:20 we see the most basic truth of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;no longer I but Christ living in me:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to God&rsquo;s economy, we should no longer live; rather, Christ should live in us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is that &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified with Christ and that Christ live in me in His resurrection.</li>
		<li>In His economy God&rsquo;s intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As regenerated people we have both an old &ldquo;I&rdquo; and a new &ldquo;I&rdquo;; the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been terminated, but the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; lives:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; who has been terminated is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who was without divinity.</li>
		<li>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; who still lives is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; into which God has been added.</li>
		<li>The old &ldquo;I&rdquo; had nothing of God in it, whereas the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; has received the divine life.</li>
		<li>The old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has become the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; because God as life has been added to it.</li>
		<li>The new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who came into being when the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; was resurrected and had God added to it.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We and Christ do not have two lives; rather, we have one life and one living:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We live by Him, and He lives in us&mdash;John 6:57.</li>
		<li>If we do not live, He does not live, and if He does not live, we cannot live.</li>
		<li>Christ lives in us by causing and enabling us to live with Him&mdash;14:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; the natural person, is inclined to keep the law that I might be perfect (Phil. 3:6), but God wants me to live Christ that God may be expressed in me through Him; hence, God&rsquo;s economy is that &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified in Christ&rsquo;s death and that Christ live in me in His resurrection.</li>
