[2]  This series of messages was given by Brother Witness Lee in the full-time training in Anaheim in the fall of 1989.
[3]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your sovereignty, and we thank You for Your sovereign grace that we may have this training.
[4]  THE CONTENT OF THE TRAINING THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY
[5]  In this term of training, I do not have the burden to release any new vision as I have done in special meetings and conferences in the past.
[6]  The term the life of God indicates that God is life just as the phrases the love of God 1 John 4:9; 2 Cor 13:14 and the light of the Lord Isa 2:5 indicate that God is love 1 John 4:8, 16 and God is light 1 John 1:5 , respectively.
[7]  The eternal life, the divine life, is the very God of whom is life, and who is the Spirit.
[8]  MAN AS AN EATING VESSEL BEFORE THE TREE OF LIFE
[9]  The picture shown by these portions of the Word is that God created man as an eating vessel.
[10]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWO THE GROWTH IN LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Col 2:19; 1 Cor 3:6-7, 9; 1 Pet 2:2
[11]  In this series of messages we shall consider the growth in life.
[12]  According to our natural concept, we cannot understand the growth in life.
[13]  If He were like a piece of gold and not a Spirit, how could He get into us?
[14]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE THREE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:19; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21; Rom 6:4-5; 11:24 THE REVELATION OF LIVING CHRIST IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[15]  In the New Testament, there are four main verses two in the Gospels and two in the Epistles which reveal the matter of living Christ.
[16]  The first verse, John 6:57, says, "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me."
[17]  We do not live by Christ, taking Christ as our instrument; rather, we live because of Christ, taking Christ as a factor of our living.
[18]  However, we are not living in ourselves, we are living in Christ, with Christ, and because of Christ, taking Christ as the factor for our living.
[19]  LIVING CHRIST BY TAKING OUR SPIRIT AS OUR PERSON WITH THE SOUL AS ITS ORGAN
[20]  The New Testament reveals that we have an old man Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22 and that we are a new man 2 Cor 5:17; Col 3:10-11; Eph 4:24; 2:15 .
[21]  Before we were saved, we were an old man without the new man.
[22]  Before we were saved, our soul was our person, and our spirit was merely an organ for us to contact and receive God.
[23]  But when we were saved, receiving Christ as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit, our spirit became our new person, a new man.
[24]  Question: As unsaved people, we lived the old man.
[25]  Now that we are saved, we live the new man.
[26]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE FOUR THE GROWTH IN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; Rom 11:24; 6:5; Gal 2:20 MAN AS A VESSEL AFTER GOD'S KIND
[27]  God created us as vessels that we might contain Him as our life.
[28]  In order to grow in life, we need to see that the Christian life is a grafted life Rom 11:24; 6:5; Gal 2:20 .
[29]  In this message we want to continue our fellowship concerning living Christ.
[30]  As we are engaged in our daily activities, our living should not be those activities, but Christ.
[31]  Our mind should be concentrated on Christ, but this concentration of our mind depends upon our love for Christ.
[32]  If we do not love Christ, we cannot live Him, and loving Him is the best way to concentrate our entire being on Him.
[33]  If our mind is not life, God and Christ as our life seem far away, and the Spirit is very objective to us.
[34]  Christ is our life, but Christ as our life is practical to us when we set our mind on the spirit, and our mind is life.
[35]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE SIX THE GROWTH IN LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-6 FREED FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH Being in Christ Jesus
[36]  Romans 7 speaks of our involvement with several persons.
[37]  Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death."
[38]  Strictly speaking, it is not the person of Christ in Romans 8:2 who frees us; it is the law of this person.
[39]  With this person of life, there is a law, the law of the Spirit of life, that frees us from the law of sin and death.
[40]  Question: Is trying to set our mind on our spirit an example of trying to do good?
[41]  Answer: In my youth I heard a saying, "To know sin is to sin."
[42]  THE TRIUNE GOD IN HIS DIVINE TRINITY DISPENSED INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN
[43]  This proves that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ are all one.
[44]  We may be weak or sick in our mortal body, but when we speak Christ in the way of imparting Him into people, not only are our spirit and our mind life, but also our dying body is life.
[45]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE EIGHT THE GROWTH IN LIFE 4 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 13, 4 PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRACTICES OF THE BODY BY THE SPIRIT
[46]  Romans 8 speaks about the processed Triune God as the Spirit of life v. 2 dispensing Himself into the transformed tripartite man.
[47]  When the Spirit of life, who is the consummation of the Triune God, enters into us, He enters into our spirit.
[48]  Question: Will saying, "Lord, I hand myself over to You" in whatever we are doing help us to learn the Lord in those things?
[49]  In this message, I will review the major points of the previous messages on the experience and growth in life.
[50]  Life is God Himself, life is Christ, and life is the Spirit, but simply to say this is not adequate.
[51]  The Spirit is the crucial element of the phrase "the law of the Spirit of life."
[52]  "The Spirit of life" means that the Spirit is life and that life is the Spirit.
[53]  The fourth crucial verse is Romans 8:11, which says, "But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."
[54]  In this long verse, all Three of the divine Trinity the Father embodied in the Son in incarnation, the crucified Son, and the Spirit in resurrection are applied.
[55]  OUR NEED OF A CLEAR VISION OF LIFE IN ROMANS 8
[56]  If you receive a clear vision of life from Romans 8, you are in the experience and growth in life.
[57]  When I was a young Christian, I read the Bible many times, and I tried to discover how to grow in life.
[58]  First, Christ comes into our spirit to make our spirit life v. 10 . Then from our spirit, He spreads to our mind to make our mind life v. 6 . Third, the processed Triune God consummated as the Spirit indwells us, making our mortal body life v. 11 . The goal of the processed Triune God is to dispense Himself into the three parts of our being.
[59]  The indwelling One, Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God, spreads from our spirit to our mind, and through our mind reaches our dying body.
[60]  Verse 14 says, "Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession."
[61]  In Romans 8 the One who indwells us is Christ.
[62]  At our end, He is Christ coming to us from God; at God's end, He is the High Priest going to God for us.
[63]  The New Testament unveils Christ, and every book in the New Testament is for the experience of Christ.
[64]  To take Christ as our life within and our living without is to live Christ v. 21a . This chapter also reveals that the reason we live Christ, taking Christ as our life and our living, is for the furtherance of the gospel vv.
[65]  The subject of chapter two is taking Christ as our pattern Phil 2:5-11 and experiencing Christ as our expression Phil 2:12-16 .
[66]  When we take Him as our pattern, spontaneously we express that pattern.
[67]  In chapter one Christ is our life and our living, in chapter two Christ is our pattern and our expression, and in chapter three Christ is our goal and our seeking, our pursuit vv.
[68]  In chapter four Christ is our strength v. 13 and our secret v. 12 . Paul said, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" v. 13 . In order to do anything, we need strength, and we also need to know the secret, the way, to accomplish a task.
[69]  As Christians, we should enjoy Christ as our life, our living, our pattern, our expression, our goal, our seeking, our strength, and our secret.
[70]  Philippians 3:7-9 says: "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.
[71]  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith."
[72]  Verse 10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."
[73]  When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he had the experiential knowledge of Christ and was experiencing the power of His resurrection.
[74]  As we have seen, this power is the person of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who is in our spirit.
[75]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 7 Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:12-16; 3:9-10; 4:2-8, 12-13
[76]  Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your presence and Your rich anointing.
[77]  Lord, we know that this is all that we need.
[78]  Philippians 1:19-21 says, "For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death; for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
[79]  In Philippians 3:9-10 Paul desired to "be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith, to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."
[80]  The righteousness of God based upon faith in chapter three is the Christ we must live and magnify in chapter one.
[81]  When we live and magnify Christ according to chapter one, people will find us in Christ, not having our own natural goodness or natural virtues, but having Christ as our righteousness.
[82]  Being found in Christ, he would have no goodness of himself, but the righteousness of God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God.
[83]  Philippians 4:5 says, "Let your forbearance be known to all men."
[84]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE GROWTH IN LIFE 7 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:2-8
[85]  Philippians 1 speaks of salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ v. 19 , living Christ v. 21 , and magnifying Christ v. 20 . In chapter two salvation is spoken of again.
[86]  We must build up a proper daily life with a proper character.
[87]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 8 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:5-8 LETTING OUR REQUESTS BE MADE KNOWN TO GOD
[88]  FORBEARANCE BEING THE SUM TOTAL OF THE HUMAN VIRTUES
[89]  Philippians 4:5-8 form one section in which the first item touched is forbearance.
[90]  Philippians 4:8 ends with the two matters of virtue and praise.
[91]  MAN BEING IN GOD'S IMAGE TO EXPRESS THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES OF LOVE, LIGHT, HOLINESS, AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
[92]  Genesis 1:26 is one of the most significant verses in the entire Bible, especially in the Old Testament.
[93]  After God created the heavens and the earth, He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."
[94]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE GROWTH IN LIFE 8 Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10-11; 6:4-5; 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 13 RECONCILED THROUGH THE DEATH OF GOD'S SON, SAVED IN HIS LIFE, AND BOASTING IN GOD
[95]  Romans 5:10-11 says, "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.
[96]  And not only so, but we also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."
[97]  Verse 10 speaks of the death of Christ and the life of Christ.
[98]  We were reconciled to God through the death of Christ, and now we are being saved in the life of Christ.
[99]  WALKING IN NEWNESS OF LIFE AND BEING IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS RESURRECTION
[100]  Romans 6 and 8 are an explanation of what it is to be saved in the life of Christ minute by minute.
[101]  Romans 6:4-5 says, "We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[102]  For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection."
[103]  Romans 8 gives us the way to experience the life of Christ.
[104]  Verse 10 says that if Christ is in us, our human spirit is life.
[105]  The dispensing of the Triune God into us makes us life in the three parts of our being: first in our spirit, second in our mind, the main part of our soul, and third in our body.
[106]  In previous messages we have considered Romans 6 and 8 and the entire book of Philippians in regard to the experience and growth in life.
[107]  In this message we will consider how transformation is related to our growth in life.
[108]  The Triune God Processed to Become the Life-giving Spirit in the New Testament
[109]  In the New Testament, the veil is taken away and the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .
[110]  In the Old Testament, the Lord as the Spirit was not there because the Triune God had not yet passed through any processes.
[111]  In the Old Testament, before the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Triune God remained the "raw" God.
[112]  Transferred from the Old Testament Ministry to the New Testament Ministry
[113]  The main thought in 2 Corinthians 3 is not that we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ.
[114]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE GROWTH IN LIFE 9 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:6-12, 16 THE MINISTRY AND MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT
[115]  Second Corinthians may be considered as the autobiography of Paul.
[116]  Paul and his co-workers were also mirrors beholding and reflecting with an unveiled face the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image 2 Cor 3:18 .
[117]  Man was made in the image of God Gen 1:26 , and Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.
[118]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE NINETEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 10 Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-14; 3:10
[119]  In the past several weeks, we have seen the experience and growth in life in the books of Romans, Philippians, and 2 Corinthians.
[120]  My burden in giving these messages is that you would gain the crucial factors and elements concerning the experience and growth in life, not just some general knowledge.
[121]  Question: Sometimes as I enjoy the Lord, I receive His grace, and when situations arise, I am able to overcome them to remain in fellowship with the Lord.
[122]  Question: Having seen something of Christ and His all-inclusive death and resurrection, why does it seem so difficult to experience these things?
[123]  Answer: The reason for this is that our vision is often very vague.
[124]  Through these experiences it is difficult to determine when Peter was regenerated.
[125]  It seems that Peter might have been regenerated when he made the declaration in Matthew 16:16 that Jesus is the Son of the living God.
[126]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY THE GROWTH IN LIFE 10 THE ESSENCE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
[127]  What we have covered in this series of messages entitled The Experience and Growth in Life is the extract of the entire New Testament.
[128]  However, through man's fall his spirit was contaminated and defiled and became deadened Eph 2:1, 5 .
[129]  In this message we will fellowship about dealing with our disposition and character.
[130]  Question: What is a practical example of dealing with our disposition?
[131]  Answer: In the New Testament, disposition and character are implied in such terms as self, soul-life, the old man, and the I in Galatians 2:20.
[132]  In the past, before we received Christ, we lived by ourselves; but now we live by Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 , not in an old way but in an entirely new way.
[133]  For many years I have observed two great frustrating factors in the Lord's work: ambition and opinion.
[134]  Those who go out in gospel teams to visit people may have experienced the problem of opinions.
[135]  On the one hand, when I worked with the co-workers in mainland China, I did not have any opinion.
[136]  Should we pray concerning our disposition, or should we seek more experience of the Lord?
[137]  Question: When some come together to fellowship, they are passive because they do not want to express their opinion.
[138]  Is it correct to speak our opinion as long as we do not hold on to it and are willing for it to be dropped?
[139]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 12 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:21-26 THE SELF, SOUL-LIFE, AND DISPOSITION IN MATTHEW 16
[140]  The words disposition and character are difficult to define even with the best dictionaries.
[141]  While there are no verses in the New Testament which directly tell how to deal with the disposition, there are a number of verses which can be used.
[142]  Since the disposition is implied in the "I," the old man, the soul, and the self, our dealing with these things includes our dealing with the disposition.
[143]  Both the good and bad dispositions destroy our usefulness in the spiritual realm.
[144]  Our disposition is what we are by birth, our natural makeup.
[145]  In our experience, our disposition is found in the "I," the old man, the self, and the soul-life.
[146]  Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."
[147]  If we look back at our life, we can realize that many of our sufferings were caused by the peculiar traits in our disposition.
[148]  In this message we will consider the experience of Christ in 1 Corinthians 7.
[149]  Incarnation is God entering into man to mingle Himself with man, making Himself one with man.
[150]  In the New Testament, the one with the strongest disposition was perhaps the Apostle Paul.
[151]  DEALING WITH THE DISPOSITION THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SIFTING
[152]  In the grafted life on Christ's side, there is no need of sifting because there is nothing negative with Him.
[153]  After we were saved and came into the church life, we brought a number of negative things with us.
[154]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 14 A WORD OF TESTIMONY CONCERNING THE LORD'S CALL
[155]  In the summer of 1933, I was called by the Lord to serve full-time, yet I struggled with the Lord concerning this matter for about three weeks.
[156]  LEARNING TO BE OCCUPIED WITH THE LORD'S CURRENT SPEAKING
[157]  In the spring of 1934, Brother Nee gave a series of messages concerning the centrality and universality of Christ.
[158]  In previous messages we have seen that our disposition is our inward being, what we are inwardly, and our character is the outward expression of what we are inwardly.
[159]  In a recent conference we saw four intrinsic matters of the church its intrinsic essence, intrinsic growth, intrinsic building up, and intrinsic fellowship see The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to Be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God published by Living Stream Ministry .
[160]  THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH THROUGH THE PURGING OF OUR DISPOSITION
[161]  Originally in God's creation there was only one man, Adam.
[162]  Now we want to go on to see that the building up of the church as the Body of Christ is by our growth in life, and our growth in life is by the growth of God in us.
[163]  When God grows in us, we grow with the growth of God.
[164]  THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 15 Scripture Reading: Phil 4:8 THE REST OF THE APOSTLE'S TEACHING CONCERNING LIVING CHRIST
[165]  Paul's teaching in the book of Philippians is concerning our living of Christ.
[166]  After much teaching concerning the main aspect of his subject, in 4:8 he says, "For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things."
[167]  Many elements of our character are often expressed unconsciously by our nature and habit.
[168]  Young people should try their best to pick up good habits.
[169]  Because many Christians have not seen the principle of incarnation, there have been many debates concerning the nature of the Christian life.
[170]  The word of Jehovah came objectively upon the speakers, and they declared that it was not their word but the Lord's. However, in 1 Corinthians 7:25 Paul said, "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful;" and in giving his opinion he said, "But I think that I also have the Spirit of God" 7:40 . Paul indicated that what he spoke was not a word from the Lord; it was his opinion.
[171]  THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AS A LIFE WITH THE PROCESSED AND DISPENSING GOD
[172]  The Christian life is a life in which God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved people live together with the processed and dispensing God.
[173]  This is a life in the principle of incarnation, and it is a mingled life, a life in which God and man are mingled together.
[174]  Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
[175]  In this message I will give a further conclusion to the fellowship concerning the experience of life.
[176]  The first part is to remember that we now have Christ within us as our Partner all the time.
[177]  In our practical Christian experience, we must always remember what we are.
[178]  Before the Lord's crucifixion Peter was very confident in himself that he would not deny the Lord Matt 26:33-35 .
[179]  In the previous chapters we have seen that the Christian life is a mingling of two persons living together as one.
[180]  If we are seeking after the growth in the divine life and seeking to live the Christian life, we should always remember who our Savior is.
[181]  As believers in Christ we have been made one with God and have become the members of Christ.
[182]  God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is both the individual Christ and the corporate Christ.
[183]  The individual Christ is simply Christ Himself, but the corporate Christ is Christ with all His members.
[184]  As we have seen, Christ is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and He is the embodiment of God.
[185]  Christ is many other items, such as the reality of the plants mentioned positively in the Bible.
