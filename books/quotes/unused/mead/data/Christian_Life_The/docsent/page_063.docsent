   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All of us need to be clear about the significance of the compound ointment as a type of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to have a clear revelation of the Spirit, we must be clear about this type.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is similar to our vision of the human government on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to see the situation of human government on earth from the divine viewpoint, we must be clear about the significance of the great human image in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not understand the significances of that human image, we cannot understand human government in the biblical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Exodus 30 there is a type of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a particular, unique type.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This type is beyond our human thought and realization, yet it must be interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As children of God, we are obliged to understand the type of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must understand this type in order to understand the Spirit, just as we must understand that great human image in Daniel 2 in order to understand the prophecy concerning the political government on this earth in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The significance of the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is greater than the creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This type shows us that eventually our Triune God, after passing through all the processes, has become this ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our processed and consummated Triune God is this ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day after day and moment after moment this ointment is working, moving, acting, and speaking within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This moving of the ointment, this anointing, teaches us concerning all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The anointing is the working, moving, acting, and speaking of the ointment, and the ointment is the consummation of our Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can see now that this type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Christian life is the acting, moving, working, and speaking of the consummated God who is typified by the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this life, both God and man are applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are a poor man, a low man, but we have an uplifted man, a man of the divine standard, in this anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this anointing, we also have Christ's death and His death's effectiveness, which is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God through His death so that we could be regenerated to be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How sweet is the effectiveness of His death as typified by the cinnamon!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in this anointing, we have Christ's resurrection applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ's resurrection is so powerful, especially in the sense of resisting and repelling the enemy and all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is typified by cassia, which was used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ's resurrection resists all the opposition and attacks from the enemy, and it repels all the evil "insects" and "snakes."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ's resurrection is repelling all the demons, evil spirits, and especially their leading one, the snake, the old serpent, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christian life is not the living out of our natural human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These good things, along with the evil things, belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only the Christian life that is revealed in the Scriptures as the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit belongs to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that the fellowship in this message will give us a clear picture of the Christian life.</S>
