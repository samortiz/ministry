the Content of the Bible Not Being a Problem</h2>
<p>The principle is the same concerning not being able to remember what we have read in the Bible. We often do not remember what we ate several days ago, but this does not change the fact that we ate. This is often our experience in reading God&rsquo;s Word. Although we may forget what we have read, we must admit that we contacted God in our reading of the Bible.</p>
<p>This can be compared to a person being in the sunlight. Although he is under the shining of the sun for only five or ten minutes, the effect of the sunlight remains with him even when he is no longer outside. This can also be compared to taking a bath. When a person completes a bath, he dries off the bathwater. Although he is no longer wet, the dirt on his body has been washed away. It is the same with reading the Bible. Although we may not understand much and may remember even less, we receive the shining of God&rsquo;s face and the washing of the water in the word when we read the Bible (Eph. 5:26). As a result, we are enlightened and refreshed. It is sufficient to read the Bible in this way.</p>
<p>It is not necessary that we fully understand or remember what we have read in the Bible. It is more important that we contact God&rsquo;s word, that is, the expression of God, which is also God expressed. Whenever we read the Bible, we must have the concept that we are not studying it with our mind but contacting God Himself with our heart and spirit. When we read the Bible and contact God in this way, we will be satisfied. If this is our situation, being unable to remember what we have read will not be a problem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding Curiosity and Inquisitiveness<br />
When Reading the Bible</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must guard against being distracted by our curiosity and inquisitiveness. In reading the Bible many Christians are distracted by their curiosity and inquisitiveness. For example, the first verse in the New Testament says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1). These words immediately cause us to want to know more about David and Abraham, and the following verses, which contain a whole series of fathers begetting sons, raise more questions in our mind. Since we do not understand what we have read, we can spend much time looking for answers in reference books. Even after much research, however, we still have not gained anything. This is an example of being distracted by curiosity and inquisitiveness when reading the Bible.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we should not be too inquisitive. We should always bear in mind that the Bible is the expression of God. Hence, when we read the Bible, our goal should be to contact God. It is good if we understand what we are reading, but if we come across something that we do not understand, we should not strain for an understanding. If we read chapter 1 of Matthew in this way, without being bothered by our inability to understand and without being distracted by a desire to merely seek knowledge, we will have a sense of enlightenment and freshness when we finish reading the chapter. It will be as if we are under the shining of the sun and the washing of water. First and foremost, we need to remember that we should read the Bible to contact God.</p>
<p>The Bible is the Word of God, the expression of God. God expresses Himself in order that He may enter into us to be our life. God is so mysterious that without the Word, it would be very difficult to contact Him. Thankfully, He is the Word. When we touch and contact the Word, we can touch and contact God. Therefore, in order for us to contact God and enjoy Him as life, we must read the Bible. However, when we read the Bible, we must be careful not to fall into the temptation of merely studying with our mind. We must have the firm realization that the Bible is the expression of God. Therefore, we need to use our heart and spirit to contact the words in the Bible. If we do this, we will be inwardly satisfied, restful, and watered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
BEING THE ENTERING IN OF GOD</h2>
<p>God is not only the Word and in His words, but He is also the Spirit and in the Spirit. God is in His words for His expression, and God is in the Spirit for His entering into us. The Word is God coming forth to us, God being expressed, and the Spirit is God entering into us. Hence, the Word is God&rsquo;s coming forth, whereas the Spirit is God&rsquo;s entering in. As the Word, God presents Himself to us; as the Spirit, God enters into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word Being outside of Us and<br />
the Spirit Being within Us</h2>
<p>In actuality, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. Outside of us, the Spirit is embodied in the Word; inside of us, the Word is realized as the Spirit. Whenever we receive the words of the Bible into our being, these words become spirit and life and are realized as the Spirit. Although the words in 2 Corinthians 6:14 seemingly speak only of not being dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers, we can sense the operation of the Spirit in us when we read this verse. As soon as these words enter into us, we realize them as the Spirit.</p>
<p>When the words of the Bible become the Spirit in us and operate in us, they are life to us. Even though the Bible is a book of life, this is not readily apparent because outwardly the Bible appears to be just a book. The words in the Bible must be read and received into us so that the words in the Bible can become life to us through the operating Spirit. The Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). This shows that His words are life only when they are spirit to us. If the Bible is merely words to us, it will not be life to us. The words in the Bible must become the Spirit to us, and then they also will be life. The words in the Bible become the Spirit when they enter into us. Strictly speaking, if the Bible is only a book in our hands, its words will not be life to us but rather letter, because they are only in our mind. The words in the Bible will become the Spirit to us when we read the Bible with our spirit and allow the words in the Bible to touch our spirit and enter into us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
