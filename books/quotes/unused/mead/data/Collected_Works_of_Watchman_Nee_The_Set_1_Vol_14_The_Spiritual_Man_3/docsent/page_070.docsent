   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR OVERCOMING DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The experience of overcoming death is not rare among the saints.</S>

   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>David was delivered from the paws of the lion and the bear and also from the hand of Goliath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Elisha once cast meal into a pot to get rid of a fatal poison 2 Kings 4:38-41 .</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul once shook off a viper into the fire without being hurt Acts 28:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Enoch and Elijah were both raptured into heaven without tasting death even more excellent examples of overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's intention is to lead His children into the experience of overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To overcome sin, the self, the world, and Satan is very crucial; but our victory still is not complete if we fail to overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we want to have a complete victory, we must overcome "death, the last enemy" 1 Cor 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We leave one enemy undefeated if we do not experience overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is death in the natural world, death within us, and death that originates from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The earth is under a curse, and every creature is under the ruling of this curse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to live with constant victory in this world, we have to overcome the death in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, death is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day we were born, death was already operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And who among us, having been born, is not now going toward the grave?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think of death merely as a "gate"; we should know that death is a process.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Death is already in us, and it is gradually and continually eating us up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The final breaking away from our physical body is simply the work of death at its climax.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Death can attack our spirit to make it short of life and power; it can attack our soul to make it confused and devoid of feeling, thought, and opinion; or it can attack our body to make it weak and sick.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 5 says that "death reigned" v. 17a . This is not only death; it is the reign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This reigning of death exists in the spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although our body is not dead yet, death already reigns in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the power of death has not reached its climax, it is already reigning and expanding its territory in the entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The various sicknesses that we find in our body show how much the power of death is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of these lead us to the end of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition to this reign of death, there is also the reign of life v. 17b . The apostle said that whosoever receives the gift of righteousness by Jesus Christ "will reign in life," a reigning that far surpasses the power of the operation of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because believers today put so much emphasis on the matter of sin, they forget the problem of death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Overcoming sin is crucial, but we must not neglect the overcoming of death the two complement each another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 5 through 8 deals most clearly with the matter of overcoming sin, but this passage gives equal attention to the matter of overcoming death: "The wages of sin is death" 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostle stresses not only sin itself but also the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He not only shows that righteousness is versus sin but also that life is versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many believers concern themselves only with overcoming various manifestations of sin in their daily life and character, yet they neglect overcoming death, which is the result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God does not say much through the apostle in these chapters regarding the various manifestations of sin in daily living; He rather stresses very much the result of sin death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must see clearly the relationship between sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ died to deliver us not only from sin but also from death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is calling us to overcome both.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As sinners we were originally dead in sin, and sin and death reigned as kings in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because the Lord Jesus died for us, our sin and death were swallowed up by His death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Death was originally the king in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since we have been baptized into His death, however, we are not only dead unto sin; we are also able to receive life and live unto God 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are joined unto Christ; therefore, as "death lords it over Him no more" v. 9 , so neither can it bind us anymore v. 14 . The salvation of Christ replaces sin with righteousness and death with life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we read this passage of the Bible carefully, we shall see that these are the main points of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we receive only half, surely we will not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the apostle speaks of the completeness of the salvation of the Lord Jesus, he says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may have much experience of overcoming sin, but how much have we experienced overcoming death?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because God's uncreated life entered into our spirit when we believed in the Lord and were regenerated, we have some experience in overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But is this the only experience that we can possibly have?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To what extent can life overcome death?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One thing is certain: most of today's believers have not experienced the overcoming of death to the degree that God has purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must admit that death operates in us in a stronger way than does life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we should pay equal attention to both sin and death in the same way that God does.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must overcome death in the same way that we overcome sin.</S>
