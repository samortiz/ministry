   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOOD PART OF THE FLESH The Wisdom of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two aspects to the good part of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, there is the wisdom of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, there is the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us first consider the wisdom of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many fleshly persons can do many things beside committing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have a good mind that is capable of thinking and scheming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They can be quick to understand and apt to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the wisdom of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This wisdom was with us before we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we have believed in the Lord and have been baptized, these things should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, after we are saved, we try to serve Him in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We want to do everything for His sake, and we try to please Him by testifying for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spontaneously, we apply the wisdom that we formerly employed in our business to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wisdom that we used to apply to our studies, our business, and our managing of human relationships is now applied to the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may think that it was wrong to use our wisdom in the world, but right to use it in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I did not realize this truth until I had been in the Lord's work for six or seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day I read John 3:6 which says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I understood then that whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh no matter where it is applied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another passage that is in Romans 8 says, "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God" v. 8 . This verse does not say that the evil of the flesh does not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It says that the flesh as long as it is the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then I read the Lord's Word in John 6:63 which says, "The flesh profits nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It profits nothing whether it is the good flesh or the bad flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the Lord's word to us is not flesh; it is spirit and life, and only His words can give life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Other than that which is from the new life and the spirit, everything else is from the flesh and is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's work, the only wisdom we can apply is spiritual wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can only work according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We often read the Bible the same way that we read an ordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But God will destroy the wisdom of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has chosen the foolish things in this world to put to shame those who are wise 1 Cor 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the spiritual journey, the wise do not have any advantage over the foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One does not become more spiritual because he is more wise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A wise and thoughtful person is the same as a foolish person when it comes to spiritual matters both need faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The wise one may understand things quicker, but this does not mean that he can acquire the spiritual realities faster.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He must have faith, obedience, and consecration in the same way that the foolish one does, before he can acquire spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to receive spiritual things, there are no shortcuts; believing, obeying, and consecrating are the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Power of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us come back to the first aspect of the goodness of the flesh natural strength or the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people are powerful in preaching; they have natural attraction, organizational skills, and management skills.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They think that these make them good helpers to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the power of attraction in preaching and leadership, the ability to save souls, organizational and management skills, and a talent for design and methodology do not add anything to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; when it sins it is the flesh, and when it applies itself to God's work it is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A Chinese is always a Chinese whether he is in England or in China.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The place may change, but the person does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The evil flesh is abominable in God's eyes, but the good flesh is equally abominable in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The flesh cannot please God when it sins, and it equally cannot please God when it applies itself to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The flesh is useless in combating sin, and it is equally useless in doing God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank God that He has brought all men down to the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one is "taller" than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nothing in the old creation can be brought into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nothing in Adam can render any help to anything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything in the old creation, whether power or wisdom, is useless in the building up of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a great mistake for God's worker to think that a man with eloquence, intelligence, articulation, and ability would be a big catch if he ever was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He thinks that such a man would be greatly used by the Lord and does not realize that the only things that a man can consecrate to the Lord are things from the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do you think that the things of the first Adam can ever render any help to the second Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose you see a country person who is poor in words, thoughts, and writings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You preach the gospel to him and he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose another man, who is young, educated, eloquent, and intelligent, is also saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What would you think of these two persons?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may think that there is considerable hope for the young, educated man because he has a good background.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may think that there is not much hope for the country person, but that the young man is a good piece of material.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, what kind of material is he?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is material destined for hell!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where does such material come from?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It comes from the flesh, and it deserves nothing but the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everything that he originally has is the flesh and is abominable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That which is born of the flesh is the flesh, and it has nothing to do with God's work.</S>
