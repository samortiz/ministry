   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 26 Date:July 29, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER W. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was raised in a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, my mother heard the gospel and believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, I was saved through a sister who preached John 3:16 to me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later a sister introduced me to the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After I read them, I realized that denominationalism is wrong, and I left the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I worked in the villages for eight years and brought some people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later I became sick from a tumor in my belly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A doctor operated and told me that I was in grave danger.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time I felt lonely, and I wanted to die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I did not want to wait to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a person is about to die, he loses all desire for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In desperation I gave up on myself and committed myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I stayed in the hospital for fifty days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The day I was discharged from the hospital, I was like a person walking out of the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The glory of God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the past few years I have suffered much but have not learned enough lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although I have covered my head outwardly, my head is not covered inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By nature I am an active and outgoing person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, the Lord arranged for me to come to Foochow, Fukien, and I handed myself over.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I found out that I could participate in this training, I seemed to find my support and my trust once again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have wasted too much time in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that from now on, you will take the straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you want to receive God's grace directly and definitely, you have to follow the footsteps of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will do you good and will save you much time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man only contacts the Lord directly and will not receive any help from the church, his pathway is individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who take an individualistic pathway often end up with curses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, as long as one learns some lessons, his time is not wasted entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to remember Moses' word, that a curse can be turned into a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to ask the Lord to turn the curses into blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the Lord's mercy that you are preserved up to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the coming days if you will give yourself to serve in the church, your pathway will be shortened and you will be spared many unnecessary detours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is the Body of Christ, and you have to submit to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, you still will have a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to learn to accept the judgment of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The judgment of the Body is much more trustworthy than our own judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we fall into darkness individually and are short of light, we can find light in the Body and in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To many people the knowledge of the Body is nothing more than a doctrine; there is little practical testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We, however, have to learn the lesson of submission in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are all middle-aged now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can no longer waste our time on inconsequential things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to accomplish much within a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need the Lord as much now as we did the first day we met Him.</S>
