   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must turn away from traditional theology and come back to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible, the Triune God has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Based upon the revelation in the Word, we may say that today our God is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is no longer unprocessed, or raw.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To say that God has been processed means that He became a child born of a virgin and that, as a man, He was crucified, buried, visited Hades, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This certainly was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we may speak of our God as the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the time of His birth through His resurrection, Christ was being processed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The entire span of His human life, from incarnation through resurrection, was a period of process.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now, having entered into the state of resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Christ is the life-giving Spirit, it is easy for us to breathe Him in. According to Romans 10, God is not far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the contrary, He is very near, even in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All we need to do is breathe Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This surely is good news, glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gospel is that the unique God, the Creator, one day became a man and passed through a process in order to become the life-giving Spirit for us to breathe in. The letter kills, but this Spirit gives life 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our God has done everything necessary to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we not only have God and the Savior we also have the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews do not know that God has become a man named Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, they know God as the Creator and fail to recognize Him as the One who has been incarnated to be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even many Christians today only know God and Christ in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not realize that, as the very God Himself, Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot separate God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may enjoy the three-one God as the Spirit because He has come into our spirit and has made us one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consummation of God s deeds, of all He has done, is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, God created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, through incarnation He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, through death and resurrection He was processed to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now God is not only the Creator, the Redeemer, and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ultimately and consummately, He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Spirit is an all-inclusive drink for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord for the revelation in the Word that the very One who is our God, Creator, Savior, Redeemer, Lord, and Master is also the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD S SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition to the doings of God, the Bible reveals God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 1:1 and 2 say, In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result of God s doings, we have the life-giving Spirit, and as a result of God s speaking, we have the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, the Word is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may use electricity as an illustration of the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the application of electricity, there is often the need for an antenna and a ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By means of an antenna and a ground wire electricity may be applied in different ways and the electricity will flow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit may be compared to the antenna, and the Word, to the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many Christians today concentrate on the Word as the ground wire, but they neglect the Spirit as the antenna.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many, especially those in the seminaries and Bible colleges, study the Bible, but neglect the Spirit, the antenna.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the other extreme are the Pentecostalists who emphasize the Spirit, the antenna, but do not adequately care for the Bible, the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We in the Lord s recovery should be balanced and have both the antenna and the ground wire, both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are balanced concerning the Spirit and the Word, we shall experience the transmission, the flowing, of the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the heavenly electricity, God has been installed in us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in order to enjoy Him, we need the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise Him that in our hands we have the Word and that in our spirit we have the life-giving Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit and the Word are two great gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is important for us to realize that the Word is the embodiment of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, the Word is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should never separate God, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is the Word, and the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If God were not the Word, He would remain a great mystery as far as we are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For example, if a person does not speak out what is in him, he will be mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if he speaks, he will make himself known, and what is in him will be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By His speaking, God has revealed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because God is a speaking God, He is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more a person speaks, the more transparent he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We praise the Lord that through His doings He has become the Spirit and that through His speaking He has become the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Day by day we need to come to the Word with an open, exercised spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we shall not only receive light from the Word; we shall enter into a realm, a sphere, of light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever we come to the Bible with a pure heart and a right spirit, we enter into a sphere of light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then instead of simply receiving enlightenment, we shall be in a realm of light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Simply to see light from the Word is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to be in the sphere of light.</S>
