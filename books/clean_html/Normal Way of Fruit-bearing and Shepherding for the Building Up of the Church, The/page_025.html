<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY BY NOT CRITICIZING OR DISSENTING</h2>
<p>The New Testament tells us that there are a few things that we must not tolerate. If anyone worships idols, we should cleanse ourselves of him, and if a brother is in immorality, we must ask him to repent (1 Cor. 5:11; 2 Tim. 2:20-21). To ask a brother to repent is not a criticizing; it is a loving admonition. Likewise, we cannot tolerate division, and we will not receive anyone who denies that Jesus is the Son of God or claims that the Bible is not divinely inspired (Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; 1 John 4:2-3; 2 John 7, 10; 2 Tim. 3:16). As to other matters, however, it is better to care for the building up by not speaking a word of criticism. Criticism always comes from a dissenting disposition, and it undermines the building. Whether a brother cuts his hair long or short or whether he has a beard or shaves, we should not say anything. Likewise, whether the sisters wear short skirts or long skirts, we should not speak a word. These matters are up to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. If someone arranges his home in a nice way or a messy way, we should simply let that go. We must stay away from any kind of criticism, because criticism comes from dissension, which has its source in the fallen disposition, in which Satan, the subtle one, is lodging. This damages the building. Instead, we need to preserve the building.</p>
<p>When we come together in the service groups, we must first keep the oneness. If the leading brothers in the service ask us to arrange the chairs in a peculiar way, we should not speak a dissenting word. We should simply do as they say. Even if arranging the chairs in that way seems foolish, to go along with the brothers is much better than to be dissenting. There is no need to argue with them to show that we know more than they do. To do that would truly be foolish. Since those brothers are taking the lead, we should do as they say. Perhaps after a further time of prayer they will ask us to arrange the chairs in a more appropriate way. In that case, we should not be offended. We can simply say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord for His wisdom&rdquo; and do as they ask. Although this is an extreme example, it illustrates the need of oneness in the church life. If there is a situation of oneness among us, people will be impressed. They will say, &ldquo;Surely this is the church life.&rdquo; However, we may argue with the brothers and say, &ldquo;You are foolish. How can we set up the chairs in this way?&rdquo; In this case, people will say, &ldquo;This is not the church. It is a place of fighting.&rdquo; What matters is not the way we do things; what matters is the oneness.</p>
<p>After being in Southern California for over twelve years, the brothers here can testify that I have not dissented from them. Whatever they say, I go along. Some have said that the brothers here only say yes to me. In actuality, it is more often the case that I say yes to them. Quite often they ask me how I feel about something but go on to do it differently from my feeling. I am never unhappy with them. I simply say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord. Your way is better.&rdquo; This is the way I served with Brother Watchman Nee in China. After a revival was brought in to the church in Hong Kong through Brother Nee, he cabled me to come and arrange the service of the elders, deacons, and the whole church there. One night after I arrived, he turned the meeting over to me. I told him, &ldquo;Brother Nee, as long as you are here, I will follow you and not speak anything of my own.&rdquo; This demonstrates that in the Lord&rsquo;s work in the church, the first matter is the oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO GO ALONG WITH OTHERS<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF THE BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>We should not think that we are smart and have a better way. Even if our way is better, we should not make a show of it. If the Lord puts us in the position of &ldquo;driving the car,&rdquo; then we should drive it, but if He makes someone else the driver, we should let him drive. No one wants a back-seat driver. I have watched brothers fight about the way to drive somewhere. A ride may take twenty-five minutes, but a smart brother may know a shortcut that saves ten minutes. However, if he fights with the driver about taking the shortcut, the whole ride may take an hour. The driver will insist that he is in control, and the passenger will tell him to humble himself and listen to others. This is foolish. This kind of fighting exhausts the brothers, upsets them, and stirs up their mind. The wise way is to let the driver do his job. The difference between the long way and the shortcut means nothing, but the fighting means very much. We should never fight. If the driver takes the long way, we should praise the Lord and use the extra ten minutes to rest. We must never argue or dissent. Whatever the brothers do, we should simply go along.</p>
<p>Many times I agreed with the leading ones in the church here simply to be one with them. We cannot expect that everyone will be like us. If I expect all the saints in all the churches to whom I minister the word of the Lord to be the same as me, I am the most foolish person. The wisest way is not to expect others to be like ourselves. A husband cannot even expect his wife to be the same as he is. She is a female, and he is a male; how can she be the same? Because they are two different persons, it is impossible to be exactly alike. Therefore, the restful, happy way is to go along with others. A husband may not like to eat something, but the wife will say it is healthy for him. In that case he should praise the Lord, not complain, and simply eat it. We must learn to go along with the dear saints. As long as they are not in idolatry, immorality, division, or blasphemy to the Lord Jesus, we should go along with them in every aspect. What they are doing is not wrong. Whether they desire to read Genesis or Revelation does not matter. Every book of the Bible, even every page, is wonderful. There is no need to argue. To read one book rather than another may be good, but to dissent is poor. We must learn not to be dissenting.</p>
<p>Psalm 133 says, &ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity! /...For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever&rdquo; (vv. 1, 3b). We must believe this short word. The Lord commands His blessing of life where the oneness is. The blessing is not on our being right; it is on our being one. To keep the oneness is not to keep being right. Being right has no clear standard. Our sight in this matter is not trustworthy. Ten years ago a certain tie may have been considered too wide, but today it is too narrow. There is no definite standard as to how wide is wide and how narrow is narrow. Therefore, we should not think that we are right. I say again, there are only a few things that we cannot receive: idolatry, immorality, division, blasphemy, and not believing in the divine Word. Otherwise, whatever the saints do is all right.</p>
<p>No one can have the assurance that his way is right. How can we say what the right way is to arrange the chairs? Right or wrong depends upon our view, understanding, purpose, vision, and background. Therefore, we must not dissent or contradict. We should simply praise the Lord and be one with the dear saints. Because we are in the Lord&rsquo;s church, His Body, and the way of His recovery, we have no opinion. We are on the way to reach the goal. We may get there in two days, two months, or two years, but Hallelujah, we are on the way! Only the Lord knows when we will reach the goal. If someone insists that his way is the short way to a destination, it will eventually be the long way, because there will be fighting the whole time. We have seen this in the history of Christianity, and we should not repeat it. The oneness is precious; may the Lord Jesus help us to keep it.</p>
<p>We must all be built up as a spiritual house, which is the holy and royal priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices. As long as we are built up in this way, whatever we render to the Lord will be an offering. This is our service to Him, and it will show forth the virtues of Him who has called us. No one can say which way is right or wrong. The only right way is the way of building. As long as we are one, we are right, but if we are not one, regardless of how right we feel that we are, we are wrong. The only right way is to keep the oneness.</p>
