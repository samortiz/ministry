   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 1 Corinthians 12:28, God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians 4 it is Christ who gave the apostles, prophets, and teachers v. 11 , but in 1 Corinthians 12 it is God who placed these members in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is it God who placed or is it Christ who gave?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Again, this involves the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever God the Son did was the move of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While God the Son was giving the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers to the church, God the Father was placing all these gifted persons in the church within Christ's giving.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has placed the members, each one of them not only the gifted persons , in the Body, even as He willed 1 Cor 12:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may say that you are a small member.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But whether you are a large member or a small one, you have been placed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You are where you are because God has willed and is still willing for it to be so.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason that if we do not come to the church meetings, we do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not feel that we are where we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has placed each member in the Body, even as He willed.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That faith was measured to you, that is, apportioned to you in a certain measure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No doubt Paul had a large measure of faith, and you have a smaller measure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet you still have a measure of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was God's apportionment.</S>
