<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Right Thigh as a Heave Offering<br>unto Jehovah&#151;the Power of Christ in Ascension<br>for the Strengthening of the Serving One</H2><P>The portion of the offering priest is also the right thigh as a heave offering to Jehovah (Lev. 7:32-34). The right side in the Bible always indicates the highest position. The right thigh as a heave offering signifies the power of Christ in ascension, the power of the One who is in the highest position, seated at the right hand of God.</P><P>Resurrection mainly refers to life. Ascension refers to power. On the day of resurrection, the Lord breathed the Spirit into the disciples; that was the Spirit of life (John 20:22). Then on the day of Pentecost in His ascension, He poured out the Spirit of power, which was symbolized by the mighty wind (Acts 2:2). The Spirit of life is breath, and the Spirit of power is the mighty wind. The breath gives life and the wind is powerful. The day of resurrection was a day of breath, a day of life, but the day of Pentecost was a day of wind, a day of power.</P><P>The right thigh is offered as a heave offering. This indicates the power of Christ in His ascension for the strengthening of the serving one. Therefore, the two main portions for the enjoyment of the priests who conduct the offering are the cakes for their nourishment and the right thigh for their strengthening. This means that in our service we need the nourishment and the power. We need the cakes and the right thigh. We need the cakes typifying the crucified human life of Jesus, the humble human life of Jesus, and the saturated human life of Jesus as our nourishment for our service, and we also need the right thigh to empower us for our service.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Priesthood's Portion&#151;the Breast<br>as a Wave Offering before Jehovah&#151;<br>the Love of Christ in Resurrection<br>for Nourishment to All the Priests</H2><P>The priesthood's portion refers to the portion for the body of the priests. The word priesthood has two meanings. It means the priestly service, the priestly ministry, and also the priestly body, the corporate body of priests. Here the priesthood refers to the priestly body.</P><P>The priesthood's portion, the portion for the whole body of priests, was the breast as a wave offering before Jehovah (Lev. 7:30-31, 34). For the heave offering, the preposition is unto, that is, it is heaved unto Jehovah. For the wave offering, the preposition is before, that is, it is waved before Jehovah. The Lord Jesus was before the Father in His resurrection and unto the Father in His ascension. The breast as a wave offering before Jehovah signifies the love of Christ in resurrection for nourishment to all the priests. Since we are the priests, we can enjoy Christ's love in His resurrection, the love in life. Of course, love is not a matter of power in ascension. Love is a matter of life in resurrection.</P>
