   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENDEAVORING TO SPEAK EVERYTHING WITH A VERSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OR A PORTION OF THE SCRIPTURE AS ITS BASE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to endeavor to speak everything in the meetings with a verse or a portion of the Scripture as its base.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our speaking must be based upon the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, it is always good to pick up an appropriate verse to match our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord s speaking, the anointing, the power, and an appropriate verse from the Bible are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When all these elements are present, the word that we speak is the living Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our speaking must always be mingled and blended with the Triune God through the Spirit in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ENDEAVORING TO TAKE CARE OF THE FLOW</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we meet, we have the assurance of the Lord s promise that He is with us Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible reveals that, as the Spirit, He is the breath and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 3 the Greek word pneuma is translated into spirit v. 6 and wind v. 8 . Whether pneuma means wind or spirit depends upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 8 says that it blows, and the sound of it can be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that it is the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A regenerated person is like the wind, which can be realized, but which is beyond understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The very Lord who is with us in our meetings is like the breath and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit was like a rushing violent wind that filled the room where the believers were Acts 2:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God was in that blowing wind because He Himself is the wind, the air, and the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word ruach can be translated into wind, breath, or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Ezekiel 37 ruach is translated in these three ways vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5, 9, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We believe that whenever we meet in the name of the Lord, He is with us as the air and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wind blows and flows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the meeting there is a spiritual flow, and we must learn how to follow this flow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit may be flowing in a certain direction in a meeting, but we may behave against the flow and miss it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flow always goes together with the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The atmosphere of the meeting is the issue of the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Someone s speaking in a meeting may stop the flow of the meeting, and the entire meeting may be brought out of the flow and its accompanying atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we must learn to follow the flow and atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AVOIDING SPEAKING MERELY DOCTRINES,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THOUGH SCRIPTURAL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our meetings we should avoid speaking merely doctrines, though scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not want mere doctrines without some reality for the Christian experience and without the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we speak, we should minister the Spirit and the divine life into others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>AVOIDING REFERRING TO SECULAR STORIES,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ILLUSTRATIONS, AND PARABLES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we speak, we should also avoid referring to secular stories, illustrations, and parables.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we were raised up, educated, and instructed in many ways in human society, we have a tendency to speak secular things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the church meetings we are speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is hard for us to keep our speaking away from secular stories, illustrations, and parables.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we use secular things in our speaking, we eliminate the power and the impact of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a subtraction from our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we speak, we have to do it without any reference to secular things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>AVOIDING QUOTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>FROM BOOKS WITHOUT SPIRITUAL WEIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should avoid quoting things from books without spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many times people like to quote from others books in their speaking because they think that these quotations can strengthen or confirm their points.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They also may quote others to strengthen or confirm that they are learned and knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not need to make such a show of our knowledge of others books.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To refer to others books is a risk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may bring in things that are not according to the truth or that are not constructive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our speaking with wrong quotations from others books may distract others and destroy our intention to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To bring in quotations from other books may even create dissension, so we have to be careful when we quote others writings.</S>
