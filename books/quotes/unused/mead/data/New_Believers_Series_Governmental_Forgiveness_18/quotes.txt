[1]  We will give a different name to each of them: First, there is eternal forgiveness.
[2]  If a believer desires to run a straight course in his spiritual pursuit, he must learn the meaning of God's governmental forgiveness.
[3]  We will first distinguish the differences between these kinds of forgiveness, and then we will speak about governmental forgiveness.
[4]  First John 1:7-9 says, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[5]  After one believes in the Lord and has become a child of God, often he still needs God's forgiveness.
[6]  After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, our fellowship with God and with other children of God can be interrupted if we offend Him.
[7]  A child of God does not lose his status as a child after he has sinned.
[8]  However, he may lose his fellowship with God through his sin.
[9]  We call it forgiveness in fellow- ship because only when one turns back to God and confesses his sins can his fellowship with God be restored.
[10]  Governmental forgiveness is absolutely different from eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, and forgiveness in fellowship.
[11]  If we do not understand governmental forgiveness, it will be hard to understand what the Lord Jesus was saying.
[12]  To understand the significance of governmental forgiveness, we must consider the example of David in the Old Testament.
[13]  No portion of the Bible speaks of God's governmental forgiveness as clearly as the story of David with Uriah's wife.
[14]  He said, "Nevertheless, because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die" v. 14 . He also said, "Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife" v. 10 . Finally, He said, "I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
[15]  You may go to God and ask for forgiveness for any sin, and God will forgive you.
[16]  Brothers, God may have forgiven your sins, but even though He has forgiven you, you cannot stop His chastisement on you and His governmental hand upon you.
[17]  He will not move His governmental hand immediately away from those who have sinned against Him.
[18]  But as soon as He stretches forth His governmental hand, you can do nothing except humble yourself under His mighty hand.
[19]  The more we humble ourselves under His mighty hand and give up all resistance, the easier it is for God to lift His governmental hand.
[20]  The more we refuse to humble ourselves, and the more angry, vocal, or indignant we become, the more difficult it is for God to lift His governmental hand.
[21]  H. Trying Our Best to Be Obedient to the Lord
[22]  May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us, and may He keep us from falling into His governmental hand.
[23]  As soon as His governmental hand is upon us, we should learn to humble ourselves under His mighty hand.
[24]  The Lord said that if you do not forgive others of their sins, God will also not forgive you of your sins.
[25]  The fact that a person can call God Father proves that the matter of eternal forgiveness with him has long been settled.
