<h2 class="head1">NEWS FROM P'O NAN SHIH YANG, P'ING YANG</h2><p>To my dearest brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</p><p>Thank the Lord who cares for us! When I did not have a place to live in August of last year, He suddenly prepared a place in P'o Nan Shih Yang of P'ing Yang for me to live. There is no meeting here in the Lord's name, but there are a few brothers who live with me. Every evening we meet, and I speak something of the truth to them. We have been doing this for about a year. After the brothers received a little light of the truth, they still went to the denominations, but they felt that it did not help them as much as it once did. They wanted to leave the denominations to meet in the Lord's name, but there was no one to bear the responsibility (because I travel often). I was afraid that they did not have the assurance of the truth and were only leaving the denominations to follow their emotions, so I was not really confident about them. I could only place this matter in the Lord's hands.</p><p>Thank God! He has recently led a brother, Yang Shih Ch'ing, to move here. He walks in the same way we do and is very gifted. The brothers prayed about this matter earnestly, and the Lord's grace worked in their hearts; they really saw the error of the denominations. They boldly left the denominations and began to meet in the Lord's name. Although the so-called pastors and teachers in the denomination tried to hold them back with warm words, they could not make them look back.</p><p>Thank God! He causes His children not to fear angry looks, rolled eyes, or rudeness but to only care about faithfully going on for the Lord. Our first meeting was in September. There are now seven brothers and sisters in the table meeting. There are more than twenty people who come to the other meetings. Although they have partially obeyed the truth, their spiritual life is still weak and immature. Please ask the brothers and sisters who fellowship with us in the Lord to pray for them. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ts'ai Ch'i<br />September 16</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM PENANG, MALAYSIA</h2><p>Peace to the beloved brother in the Lord, Brother Nee:</p><p>Thank the Lord. He Himself led us to leave the denominations in the past. Now He has given us light again to see the deeper truth that our meetings should have the Lord as the center. We cannot have any name but the Lord's name. For this reason, we who walk in this way feel in our prayer that the Lord will have a meeting that is directly in His name in Southeast Asia. We should obey the Lord to accomplish His will. There is now a meeting in Singapore. According to the Lord's arrangement, we may be able to have a meeting in the Lord's name in two months. Since the work has just begun, we hope to have a gifted brother come and bear the responsibility, one who can edify us to be useful to the Lord. We have now placed this need in prayer! We hope that you, brother, also pray for this!</p><p>There is one matter that needs your help. Brother Chang You Ts'ung from the meeting in T'ung An Wu Ni, Fukien province has moved here recently with his family. Brother Chang feels that there are not enough brothers who can bear the responsibility in Southeast Asia. His son, Brother Ling Chen Kuo, studied at, but did not graduate from, the Hunan Bible School. Brother Chang has told him to leave Hunan and go to Shanghai to live with you for a time. He hopes to go to the next Overcomer Conference in Hangchow. He will have a letter of recommendation from Brother P'ei Jan. Please examine him when he arrives in Shanghai. If you think he has received a gift from the Lord and can be edified, please edify him in the matters of the truth and help him grow in spiritual life so that he can be a useful vessel to the Lord. We are enclosing a check for thirty dollars in this letter. Please keep it and give it to Brother Chen Kuo when he arrives in Shanghai to use for his expenses. Thank you for the favor. May you receive your rightful reward before the judgment seat of Christ! Peace in the Spirit!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Yang Chien Hsiung</p>
