[1]  CONTENTS An Introductory Word to the Full-timers Fellowship with the Full-time Trainees Concerning What They Should Do After the Training A Word of Farewell
[2]  According to a word from one of the sisters who has attended the full-time training for several terms, what God is wrecking is not her person, but her future, her career, and her goal.
[3]  Some saints have a real desire to serve the Lord, but they have a sense within that they are not so useful.
[4]  First, we must pray for ourselves because we have not been thoroughly cleansed.
[5]  We may have been saved for five or ten years, yet we may have never made a thorough confession to the Lord.
[6]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that in this age You have gained us.
[7]  The training that we provide is not at all like that of a seminary.
[8]  Some of us, after attending this training for five or six terms, prefer to stay in this area and work instead of returning to our sending churches.
[9]  After being produced by our sending church, we would not go back.
[10]  According to our consideration those trainees who have been here for two terms have three choices.
[11]  We may choose to go back to the church that sent us and has been supporting us, to serve the church there full-time.
[12]  At the same time, we can still serve the Lord in the church there.
[13]  Whether a church would take the new way or not, it is still the church because it is the church of God in a certain city sanctified in Christ.
[14]  So, especially after we have been trained, there is no church to which we can go that matches our requirements.
[15]  In a sense our training qualifies us to put forth our requirements.
[16]  We would all like to go to a place where the elders are so positive and one with us to help us carry out what we have been trained to do.
[17]  But where is such a church that is positively taking the new way according to what we have been hearing in the training and where all of the elders are really one with us?
[18]  When we go to serve the Lord, we should not have any choice.
[19]  If we go to a church which is opposing the new way and we are not allowed to revolt, to revolutionize anything, to chase anyone away, or to rekindle a fire, we can still preach the gospel.
[20]  After we save people, we should go back to feed them.
[21]  Do this as a common thing, without any advertisement, promotion, or imposing.
[22]  Then we can do the perfecting of the saints.
[23]  We do believe that all the churches in the Lord's recovery practice meeting in a way that is open to all the saints to pray, to give a word of exhortation, and to speak something for the Lord.
[24]  Question: What should be our view, our feeling, and our attitude toward what the Lord is raising up here?
[25]  Your fellowship is more concerned with what we have received and the Lord's sovereign arrangement, but what should be our view and our attitude toward what the Lord is doing here in the churches?
[26]  Whatever church raised us up, sent us, and has been supporting us through the years expects us to go back to serve there.
[27]  Question: In the last chapter of Brother Nee's book Further Talks on the Church Life, he talks about the work, even the centers of the work.
[28]  A local church should do a work to preach the gospel in order to gain new ones, take care of the young ones, feed them and perfect them, and build them up that they may speak for the Lord.
[29]  When a church is raised up, it should do the work of preaching the gospel, feeding the young ones, perfecting the saints, and helping the saints to speak for the Lord.
[30]  Question: Besides the work of the apostles to raise up churches and the work of the churches to enlarge and grow, is there any other aspect of the work in the New Testament?
[31]  The gifted persons should help the work of the church to perfect the saints.
[32]  They should not build up their own work, but carry on the work of the church.
[33]  CHAPTER THREE A WORD OF FAREWELL OUTLINE REMEMBER: THE CHURCH IS ALWAYS ONE
[34]  I do not use the word churches, but church, because in our eyes there are churches, but in the Lord's eyes there is only one church, His unique Body.
[35]  Wherever you go, wherever you are, wherever you stay, and wherever you serve, you should be one with the church.
[36]  Although that church is different in appearance and in a few practices, that is still the church.
[37]  Do not say that this one is an old-timer and that one is not taking the new way.
[38]  Ninth, you should not go to carry out a "work."
[39]  When some trainees return and their church agrees that they should serve the Lord full-time, they consider themselves a co-worker.
[40]  If we do not preach the gospel to save the sinners, if we do not have any young ones to feed, nourish, and cherish, if we do not collect the new ones together for a group meeting, or if we do not have the capacity and ability to prophesy for the building up of the church, we are not on the white horse.
[41]  WITH ONE SOUL IN THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL
