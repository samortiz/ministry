   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Naturally, in such preaching, one relies on the message more than on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The entire heart of these believers depends on what they preach to move human hearts instead of on the Holy Spirit to reveal to men their need and the Lord's supply to fill up their lack.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What they emphasize and trust is their own speaking, which may be entirely the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, without the enlivening by the Holy Spirit, such truth is of no profit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To rely on the words instead of on the Holy Spirit produces very few spiritual results.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People may welcome or accept such speaking, but it can only reach their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Soulish believers are fond of using sensational words in their preaching, whereas real spiritual believers can give very clear and lucid teaching which none may have ever conceived of before, because the Lord has given them much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Soulish believers like to imitate this in their work because imitating is one of their characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that only this kind of speaking will be fascinating to the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In preaching they like to use strange imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If some peculiar thoughts come upon them while walking, talking, eating, or sleeping, they will surely jot them down for future use, not questioning whether such thoughts are revealed in their spirit by the Holy Spirit and are experienced by them or are merely sudden thoughts which come to their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some soulish believers delight in helping others, but because they themselves have not reached the state of maturity, in helping others they do not know how to dispense food in due season.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not to say that they do not have knowledge; actually they have much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they see anything wrong in others or are told of some difficulty, they pretend to be experienced believers trying to help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based upon their limited insight and some ability of discernment which they have learned from more experienced believers, they speak fluently about biblical teachings and the experiences of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In helping others, soulish believers often tell all that they know and perhaps sometimes go beyond to tell what they do not know, which is merely their supposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they are helping others, they always pour forth everything which has been stored in their mind and exhibit one thing after another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not ask at all whether this is the particular illness of this particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Or, is this the need of this one?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or, is this one able to suddenly take in so many teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are like Hezekiah who opened all his storehouses and showed all his treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes it is not that there is someone drawing them out to speak, but they are stirred suddenly by their emotion, and they pour out so many spiritual doctrines, perhaps many of which are merely ideals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes such behavior is simply to show off their own knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this differs according to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some can be completely silent, not uttering a word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when there is a tremendous need, when they should speak to help others, they keep their mouth tightly closed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are suppressed by their natural shyness and fear; therefore, they are not free.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They can sit beside those talkative believers and criticize them in their heart, but their tacitness is not in any way less soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because soulish believers have not been deeply rooted in God and have not learned how to be hidden in God, they are often visible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even when they are doing spiritual work, they always seek to occupy the conspicuous position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they attend a meeting, they do not expect to hear others but rather to be heard by others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are overjoyed when they are held in high esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Soulish believers love to learn to use spiritual terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They delight in learning all the terms, phrases, and special expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When there is an appropriate occasion, they will use them one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While working, they use spiritual words as the material for their speaking, although perhaps without their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is also true in their praying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Soulish believers are very ambitious, always desiring to stand out among men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have a strong sense of vainglory in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They aspire to be powerful workers, greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They want to gain some position for themselves, that is some glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They like to compare themselves with others probably not so much with those whom they do not know, but with their co-workers and those they know.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such comparison and secret competition are very fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They look down at those who are behind them, regarding them as falling far too short.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Compared with those who have higher and deeper spiritual experiences, they think they are in no way inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They always desire to be great and to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They hope that their work will be prosperous and that it will be presentable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Naturally these things are deeply hidden in their heart, unknown to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, sometimes these thoughts are mingled with other purer thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, the prevalence of such thoughts is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy for soulish believers to become self-satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the Lord were to use them to save a person, they would be exceedingly happy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they were to succeed once, they would be elated, considering themselves successful in the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Should they know a little or learn a little, they think that they have reached a very profound stage.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A common indication of soulish believers is that they, like a small vessel, are easily filled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not have the view of seeing how great the depth of the ocean is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as there is some water in their bucket, they are complacent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have not yet lost themselves in God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Otherwise, whatever happens will be to them as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their eyes remain focused on their puny selves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, they are affected very easily by a small gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such a capacity is the reason God cannot use them more.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If they become so happy and boast to such an extent when ten persons are saved, what will happen if a thousand persons are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After some successful work in their preaching, soulish believers always have a thought that they are very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Often they dwell upon their superiority and self-delight, thinking that they are different from others, "greater than the greatest apostle," to sum this up in one word wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes they are sad because others do not regard them so.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They think that others treat them in this way simply because they are without eyes to recognize that they are the prophets from Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes they think that in their message there are several ideas which no one has ever discovered, and if the audience cannot appreciate the marvelous points, they become troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After some successful work, they will dwell in their self-satisfaction for a day or two, or at least they will feel self-contented for a few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Under such a condition they often think that soon the church of God will see a great evangelist, revivalist, or writer in them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If no one pays attention to them, how sorrowful they are!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Soulish believers are believers without principles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Their words and deeds do not follow definite principles.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Their walk of life is according to their emotion and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, they feel or think, they act, perhaps contrary to their usual conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Change can easily be noticed in soulish believers after they have done a work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They will become whatever they preach.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they preach a message on patience, they surely will be very patient for one or two days afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If they exhort people to praise God, immediately afterwards they will continually praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But these do not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is because they live according to their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Their own words stir up their emotion so that they live in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, once the emotion has passed, everything is over.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A particular point with soulish believers is that they have many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Believers who are bound by sins do not have so many gifts, and neither do spiritual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God gives soulish believers more gifts with the intention that they may voluntarily deliver all the gifts to death and regain them more gloriously in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, these believers are not willing to deliver the gifts to death, but rather, exhaustively use them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The gifts originally given by God should have been used by God for His own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, soulish believers consider the gifts to be their own, but the work they do to be of God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, they do not trust the Holy Spirit to lead and use them but instead act according to their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Furthermore, when the work is successful they render glory to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Of course, this kind of self-glorification, self-boasting, and self-admiration is done secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Regardless how humble they are and how much they render glory to God, they cannot help being self-centered in their thoughts: "The glory should be unto God, this is right, but unto God and me!"</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since they have many gifts, good thoughts, and rich emotions, they can easily arouse people's interest and stir their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, soulish believers are often very attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When they work, they are easily welcomed by common believers.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Actually they lack spiritual power, not having the power of the Holy Spirit's flowing rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What they have is limited to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What people see is what they "have," and it stops there in them so that they cannot cause others to receive spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They outwardly appear very rich, but actually they are extremely dry.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must add a few words here: believers do not have to wait to be fully delivered from the domination of sin to become soulish believers and have the above-mentioned experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>According to the actual experience of the believers, many are, on the one hand, under the domination of the body to commit sins and, on the other hand, under the influence of the soul to live by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we look at this according to the teaching of the Bible, it is even clearer because both are of the "flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Sometimes they may commit sins, and at other times they may follow themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Sometimes they either follow the body or the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In fact, many believers are such.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If a believer can commit sin on the one hand and be soulish on the other hand, then he can also be soulish on the one hand and have some spiritual experiences on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>At any rate, the experience of a believer is a very complicated matter.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This, of course, refers to the details, but the main point is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The most important question to ask ourselves is whether we have been purged from those things of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If not, then we still belong to those things of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Even if we have spiritual experience, we are still not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is only when we no longer have the experience of sin and self that we are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, a believer may have many marvelous feelings of the soul yet still have many lusts of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He can also have many spiritual experiences yet still have the feelings of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Of course, there are some who are delivered from one realm and then enter into the other.</S>
