In 5:25 Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit. In 6:1-10 Paul develops this matter of walking by the Spirit. In these verses he covers three things: how to restore one who has fallen, how to fulfill the law of Christ, and how to sow unto the Spirit. For all three, we need to turn to our spirit and walk by the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">I. HOW TO RESTORE THE FALLEN ONE</h2><p>Galatians 6:1 says, &ldquo;Brothers, if ever a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also are tempted.&rdquo; Those who are spiritual are those who live and walk by the Spirit. This is the only way to be genuinely spiritual. Those who are spiritual should restore one who has fallen in a spirit of meekness. This is our regenerated spirit, indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit. Such a spirit is the issue of living and walking by the Spirit. Notice that Paul speaks of a <i>spirit</i> of meekness. The meekness we need must be in our spirit. The source of what we do should be our spirit, not simply our kind heart. Therefore, this verse indicates that everything we do in our daily walk should be done in our spirit and from our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">II. HOW TO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST</h2><p>In 6:2 Paul continues, &ldquo;Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.&rdquo; Some expositors say that the law of Christ here refers to the Lord&rsquo;s commandment that we love one another. According to them, the law of Christ is the law of love. This is correct. However, we must go on to see that the law of Christ is the higher and better law of life which works through love (Rom. 8:2; John 13:34). The law of love, which is the law of Christ, is the law of life. Love is the expression, but life is the substance. Real love is that which issues from the divine life. The love described by Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 is the expression of the divine life. Furthermore, the fact that love is a fruit of the Spirit indicates that the substance of love must be the Spirit (Gal. 5:22). In fact, all spiritual virtues must have the Spirit with the divine life as their substance. The law of Christ, which is the law of love, must be substantiated by the divine life. This is the reason we say that the law of Christ in 6:2 denotes the law of life. Expressed by the law of love, the law of life will cause us to bear one another&rsquo;s burdens. In this way we fulfill the law of Christ.</p><p>In verse 3 Paul says, &ldquo;For if anyone thinks he is something, being nothing, he deceives himself.&rdquo; Apparently there is no connection between verse 3 and verse 2; actually there is a very real and significant connection. Those who think of themselves as something will not bear the burdens of others. Only those who do not regard themselves as anything will bear others&rsquo; burdens. Perhaps you would say that certain ones who consider themselves to be something seem to bear the burdens of others. However, this is merely an outward show, the exhibition of the self, not the genuine bearing of someone else&rsquo;s burden. In the eyes of the Lord, such a person does not actually bear anyone&rsquo;s burden. Instead, thinking himself to be somebody, he takes advantage of an opportunity to display himself.</p><p>No doubt, Paul wrote these verses according to his experience. From experience he realized that it is when we consider ourselves as nothing that we spontaneously, even unconsciously, bear the burdens of others. We do not place a high estimate on what we do. We simply do it because we are walking in the Spirit and by the Spirit. Walking by the Spirit, we are led of the Spirit to do certain things. The result is that we bear someone&rsquo;s burden without even realizing it. Paul&rsquo;s word is simple and brief, but it is full of experience.</p><p>In 6:6 Paul says, &ldquo;But let him who is instructed in the word share with him who instructs in all good things.&rdquo; The good things in this verse refer to things which are good for this life, the necessities of daily living. Even in the matter of sharing such things, we may fulfill the law of Christ, fulfilling the law of love according to the law of life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Galatians &nbsp; pg 81</div><br></body></html>
