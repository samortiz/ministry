   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Forgiveness of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the forgiveness of the kingdom, Matthew 18:21 through 35 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Up to seven times?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we cannot differentiate between the various kinds of forgiveness in reading the Scripture, we will encounter difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this portion of the Scripture, if we do not distinguish what kind of forgiveness is spoken of here, we may think that our heavenly Father can nullify eternal forgiveness and that we can no longer be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to realize that this passage is not speaking of the previous four kinds of forgiveness; rather, it is speaking of the forgiveness of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We shall receive this kind of forgiveness when the King settles His accounts with His slaves v. 23 . Concerning the church, God speaks of grace; but concerning the kingdom, it is a matter of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As regards the church, it is a matter of what the Lord has done and how He deals with man; but, as regards the kingdom, it is a matter of how we are trained before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning the kingdom, the judgment in the future depends upon the kind of living we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses speak of our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is related to the kingdom of the heavens and reigning in the millennium, not to eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are several parables concerning the kingdom in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 18:21 through 35 is one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The kingdom of the heavens is likened to a king who settles accounts with his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One owed his master ten thousand talents and had no means to repay.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He begged his master to have patience with him so that he could repay later.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The master was moved with compassion and forgave him the loan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same slave then went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather than forgive him, he cast him into prison until he would pay the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Afterward, other slaves told their master what had been done, and his master said to him, "Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the Lord Jesus finished telling this parable, He explained its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He said, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This refers to the forgiveness of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This forgiveness is not obtained by every Christian, but only by those who forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first kind of forgiveness is received through believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second kind of forgiveness is received through the declaration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The third kind of forgiveness is received by confessing our sins to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fourth kind of forgiveness is received when God sees that the time of chastening is fulfilled, and He takes away the rod of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fifth kind of forgiveness can only be obtained as we pardon and forgive others from our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We know that the daily life and work of Christians on earth will be judged in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First the Lord will receive those who have overcome and are prepared into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After all the Christians are raptured, each one will be judged before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This judgment is not concerning the matter of salvation; it is a judgment to determine whether or not a Christian is worthy to participate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For those who are worthy, this will be the time to establish their position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are two dangers one can face at the judgment seat: 1 being found unworthy to even enter the kingdom, and 2 even though being found worthy to enter the kingdom, being given a very low position.</S>
