   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The book of Hebrews shows us people with one of two identities either Jew or Christian, but the book of Acts shows us people with double identities they were both Jews and Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Acts there was the record of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time the Christians still visited the temple on the one hand and prayed in the meeting, "Lord, I consecrate myself to You," on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they realized they had sinned, they would seek help from the priest on the one hand and pray on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time Christians divided their time between being Jews and being Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were two sacrifices, two pardons, and two sin offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was the cross, and there was also an animal the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Hebrews speaks to the Christians who had shrunk back to Judaism: "Are you going to be a Christian, or are you going to be a Jew?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Acts one could be both a Christian and a Jew, but in Hebrews he could not be both.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must choose to be one of the two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There can be only one redeeming lamb, one priest, and one temple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Hebrews 10 says to not abandon the assembling of ourselves together v. 25 . If we stop meeting in Christ, there will be no more sin offering v. 26 . Hence, there is only one basic thought regarding Hebrews; that is, it is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must advance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The flow of the Spirit is always going onward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the flow of the Spirit is ever advancing, what was done in Jerusalem would not be sufficient to meet the need in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What was accomplished in Caesarea would not be adequate for today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The advancement spoken of here relates to the entire flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God let Titus destroy Jerusalem because He could only allow the existence of one Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the church was established on the earth, God destroyed the other Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The destruction of Jerusalem brought an end to the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jews might still keep the Passover today, but there is no more lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is progress.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God destroyed the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Acts, one could have two identities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when we come to Hebrews, we can have only one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a very serious charge there is no longer an animal offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the time of Acts, Paul still had a vow 18:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do not measure someone in a particular age according to God's absolute revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we must follow the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wherever the Spirit goes, we should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not wrong for Paul to cut his hair and go into the temple to purify himself 21:26 , because the flow of the Spirit had reached only to that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the book of Hebrews tears down the entire Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Hebrews says that since that which is perfect has come, Moses is over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is progressing in teaching and in the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the two thousand years of church history, the Spirit of God has been progressing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even after Acts 28, the Spirit of God is still going onward; He has never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Acts has no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are foolish if we think that the Holy Spirit has left the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, in every age God has always raised up some people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In every age the church has been progressing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From generation to generation, it is ever moving onward and ever progressing forward, even up to the present day.</S>
