   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 66 Date:September 24, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER N. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believed in the Lord Jesus and consecrated myself to Him through the gospel preaching of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I read many books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My husband was a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was very good at preaching, and his messages were full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wrote a letter to me once, saying, "You have to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This way gets narrower and narrower."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Three days after I was married, I began to experience rejection and slander from his relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the first seven years of my marriage, I cried almost every day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I heard Brother Nee's messages on overcoming, yet I often lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One of my children died of sickness, and I became very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During that time my husband was away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The hardest person to deal with in the family was my mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Her word always pricked me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I could not stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I also suffered much on account of family finances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My husband went into business at one time and was quite successful, but he soon failed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I exhorted him to withdraw from business and to give himself to preaching again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I asked God to have mercy upon me and to bless me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day I prayed desperately and asked the Lord to fill me with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I told Him, "Lord, I am not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am willing to obey You unconditionally."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord remember my tears which I have shed throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our sister suffered much criticism from the day she was married to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These unjust words stirred up many feelings in her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The words from her mother-in-law were especially unbearable, but all these were for one purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God wants you to learn one fundamental lesson you have to go on no matter what others say to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you had ignored the criticism, you would have felt better.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When our Lord Jesus was on earth, others criticized Him as a gluttonous man and a drunkard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was a great insult to Him, but He did not harbor any feeling about this and did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others said that He was possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was not affected by these words either.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord turned a deaf ear and was dumb towards these piercing and untrue criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not answer and did not react in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our Lord was mocked on the cross by a robber beside Him and by those passing by, who said, "Come down now from the cross that we may see and believe" Mark 15:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord did not mind these things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not answer one single word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have lived this way for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you were in school, you were innocent and full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As soon as you started your family, everything seemed to turn upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing seemed to match your plan and expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You began to have a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That was the first time you encountered the cross in a serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of course, this was hard for you to take.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But it was the Lord disciplining and purifying you through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord allows two kinds of people to remain on this earth: Those who criticize and those who are being criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If God gave you a choice of having a sharp tongue to criticize others or having an ear to receive sharp criticism, which one would you take?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you love the Lord and take His way, you would choose the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to learn to be an overcomer, one who accepts criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In your testimony you confessed that you often lost your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to know that temper is not a sickness but a symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is like saying that fever is not a sickness but a symptom of a sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person has a fever because he is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same way, temper is only a symptom to a man; there may be many reasons for having a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as others touch their pride, they become angry and lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others have a temper because they love themselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If such ones need eight hours of sleep, they become angry if others disrupt their sleep for one minute.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They love themselves, and they need every minute of their sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Temper has a cause behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unless the cause is removed, the temper will always come back.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unless one removes the root beneath the temper, his temper will explode sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our sister is quick in feelings and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All who are quick in feelings tend to love themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are also easily offended.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who are slow in feelings do not easily indulge themselves in self-love and also are not easily offended.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who have a desire to be good and victorious can easily become arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our sister has a temper because first she loves herself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She also wants to be ahead of others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You are sensitive in your feelings, and this can easily turn into a kind of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You have to remember that your sensitivity can easily lead you into arrogance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is true that your mother-in-law is a hard person to deal with, but you did not lose your temper because of your mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am not saying that she is right.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You lost your temper because of the spiritual problem you have before God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you love yourself and want to do well in everything, you will lose your temper when others touch or frustrate you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This has nothing to do with an impetuous disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You have a temper because you are proud, you want to be ahead of others, and you want to be good and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You have to learn two things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>First, let others say what they want to say.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Second, do not be concerned about what others are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If others say that I am possessed by a demon, that I am a gluttonous man and a drunkard, or that I am evil, what difference does that make to me?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The most they can do is consider me to be these things.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You have to take others' criticism in stride and use it as a means to deal with your self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You have to know that the Lord has special arrangements and leadings for you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is purging all pride from you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Others can speak as they please, but we can choose to ignore their words.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When a man is hurt, he closes himself up and takes care of his own wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He is like a wounded dog who moves away from other dogs to lick his wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In principle, you are acting this way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Your mother-in-law has criticized you, and you have heard much criticism among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When you come to the meeting, you are a bystander.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You hide inside your shell and have become a lonely person.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A Christian may be crucified, but he should not have the feeling of being a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is all right to be a martyr but never all right to have the feeling of being a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Consider your own life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After you were married, your life took a big turn.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>You were married to a brother, and you knew that the way was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>During the war you suffered material shortages for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>On top of that, the Lord prepared a special trial for you your mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You had thoughts of serving the Lord and helping the brothers and sisters, but when your mother-in-law ill-treated you and the brothers and sisters criticized you, you wanted to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>You no longer had a heart to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>So you chose to sit on the last row in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>For twenty years you have been licking your wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Now I will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I hope that you will deal with your problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we cannot help you to get through now, we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>You have to see the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He is dealing with your self-love and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Unless you go through such dealings, your self-love and pride will never go away.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>For years you have acted like an ashamed person.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You have been criticized, ill-treated, and embarrassed, but if you overcome these things and accept the discipline of the Spirit from now on, you will become a useful person.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Otherwise, you will be the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If you suffer and lick your wounds, constantly complaining of your lot in life, you will become a useless person.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Once you learn your lesson, you will enter other people's feelings and be able to render help and guidance to those who are in the same condition.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Do not think that you are finished because you have lost your temper, failed, and become weak.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If you overcome today, your failures for the last twenty or thirty years will become history.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>You will see that there is no reason to pity your own wounds or to love yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>You should only accept the environment and experiences that the Lord has arranged for you.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>You should allow them to trim you and destroy all that is important to you.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is your way.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You may think that you have nothing more to say with all of your history of failure.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When a man fails to learn his lessons from the thousands of failures he experiences, he may think that he has lost his testimony and is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>But as long as you overcome this last time, all of your past failures will be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Peter denied the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We all know that this was a great failure.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He would have been finished indeed if he only tended to his wound and looked at himself.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The Lord told him to establish his brother once he had turned again Luke 22:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Today your future is the same as Peter's. The question now is what are you going to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If you overcome now, you will render help to many.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>When other younger sisters have similar problems, you will be a guide to them.</S>
