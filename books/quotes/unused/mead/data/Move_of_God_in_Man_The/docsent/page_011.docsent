   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Because of the fall, sin came in, death came in, Satan came in, and the world came in.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even we ourselves became sin because our body became the flesh of sin and our soul became the self.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because of these great negative things, we surely need a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But today most Christians talk only about the need of being saved from the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not see the positive aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if we had not been damaged by sin, death, Satan, and the world, and even if we did not have the flesh and a sinful nature, we would still need God as our sunshine, air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to see that even if we had never become fallen, we would still need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the revelation in Genesis 1 and 2, before Adam fell, he needed the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Adam was sinless and pure before he fell, he still needed God as life, signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first issue of God's move in man in His incarnation is that God became Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He became Jehovah our Savior, Jehovah our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every day we need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every day we need Him as our sunshine, our air, our water, and our food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we experience Him as our Savior, we become vital believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The problem with us is that we do not experience and enjoy Him as our Savior in a continual way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the morning we may become vital after spending some time with the Lord in prayer and in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the afternoon we may become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to realize that we have a person in us whose name is Jehovah the Savior, Jehovah the salvation, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is within us and is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is in us and we are in Him, but in order to enjoy Him continually, we must learn how to do everything according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 8:4 says that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us, who walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"To walk" means to have your life and to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our speaking, our thinking, our attitude, and in everything, we must live and walk not according to our American custom or habit, but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Time after time I have to ask the Lord to forgive me when I do not walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Recently I met an old acquaintance and his wife whom I have known for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later the wife wrote a letter to me, in which she apologized for being too loose in her talk with me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before I received her letter, I also had asked the Lord to forgive me for speaking something to her and her husband that was not according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am sharing this small incident to show how little of our time is spent walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we read the newspaper, do we read it according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have to restrict myself strongly whenever I read the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I need to read the newspaper because I need to know the world situation to take care of the Lord's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I need to know about the situation politically, diplomatically, and militarily in Taiwan because we have many churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I also need to know what is going on in Russia for the sake of the Lord's move there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I need to be informed about the world situation and then pray accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we pick up the newspaper, we are tempted and attracted to look at many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we look at the newspaper, do we look at it according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, when we buy a tie, do we do it according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am sharing this to show that we need to do everything according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After many years of being a Christian, I feel that the most difficult thing for us to do today on this earth is to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word spirit in Romans 8:4 denotes our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the processed and consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all have to admit that we are short of God in our experience and in our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why we need to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be filled with the Spirit is to "pick up God," of whom we are short.</S>
