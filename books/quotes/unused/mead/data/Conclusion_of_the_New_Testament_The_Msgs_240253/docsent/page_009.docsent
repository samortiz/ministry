   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Its Appearance as Revealed in Matthew 13:24-43</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>through the Parables of the Tares,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Mustard Seed, and the Leaven 1 The Appearance of Christendom</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 13:24-43 the appearance of Christendom as the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed through the parables of the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The parable of the tares 13:24-30, 36-43 reveals the establishment of the kingdom and its false constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 24 and 25 say, The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares amidst the wheat and went away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man v. 37 , the field is the world, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one v. 38 . Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field; that is, the false believers and the true ones live in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of the heavens was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, but the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, a difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whereas the sons of the kingdom constitute the kingdom, the sons of the evil one have formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 13:31 and 32 we have a parable telling of the abnormal development of the outward appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is indeed smaller than all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a tree, a lodge for birds, having its nature and function changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is against the law of God s creation that every plant must be after its kind Gen 1:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This happened when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world in the first part of the fourth century.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, this parable corresponds to the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 , which signifies the church in union with the world through Constantine s influence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Multitudes of unbelievers were baptized and the church became monstrously great.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard herb, sojourning on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled in the earth as a tree, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches to lodge many evil persons and things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This has formed the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 13:33 we have a parable concerning the inward corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Leaven in Scripture signifies evil things 1 Cor 5:6, 8 and evil doctrines Matt 16:6, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meal here, for making the meal offering Lev 2:1 , signifies Christ as food for God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal Gen 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ the unleavened fine flour as its contents, should be unleavened bread 1 Cor 5:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified here by the woman, took many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the hiding of leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This became the inward, corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 Existing along with the Church</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>in the Church Age</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens exists along with the church in the church age, but it does not exist within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a principle, we do not allow tares in the church life, and we do not allow the big tree with its abnormal growth or the leaven with its corruption to be in the church.</S>
