The most important thing is to have outward form. A bird's life experiences the bird's living through the bird's outward form. For a saint to practically receive the Lord's life and express this life on earth is a kind of training. The experience of the birds and the aquatic creatures begins from the day that the life within them makes them a bird or an aquatic creature. From that day the birds and the aquatic creatures are able to live out their living and acquire experience. This relates to the training of the saints. The work of the Lord Jesus now is to train His saints in life. Before this training comes about, however, the saints must first be joined to the Lord's life.</P><P>VI.The work on the sixth day signifies the coming again of the Lord Jesus and His kingship. In the work on the sixth day God created Adam in His own image and charged Adam to rule over the whole earth. Five days of work had passed. All the things on earth were ready. All the objects in heaven were also set. The food and dwelling that man needed were all prepared one after another. Then God created man. The most important point in the creation of man is that he is created in the image of God. Man on earth is a representative of God. Man is God's expression. This relates to the Lord Jesus' coming again.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is the last Adam and the second Man. The first Adam was a type of Him. The first Adam was created in the image of God. Here we see a type of the coming of the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus comes back, His Body, which is His church, will also be consummated. His whole church will become His image at the time He comes back. First John 3:2 says, "If He is manifested, we will be like Him." When the Lord Jesus appears again, His church will be fully like Him. Just as Adam was created in the image of God, the Body of the last Adam, the church, will also be fully like God when the Lord comes back. The Lord's second coming will cause every saint to take up His image, the image of a glorious body given by Him.</P><P>On the sixth day Eve was created as a counterpart of Adam. Eve is a type of the church. When the Lord Jesus comes back again, the church will be consummated and will be offered to Christ as His counterpart. She will rule with Christ over the world. Eve was created on the sixth day. The church will be consummated at the time the Lord comes back. The church will also become the Lord's counterpart when the Lord comes back. The creation of Adam and Eve on the sixth day is a clear reference to the events at the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>God not only created Adam and Eve; He made them to rule over the created world. All authority was committed to them. God does not rule over the world directly. Rather, He has committed the authority to rule over the world to Adam. When the Lord Jesus comes back again, He will set up the millennial kingdom on earth to rule over the whole world. Just as the creation of Adam in the preceding paragraph relates to the Lord's coming, the commissioning of Adam to rule over the world relates to His kingship. In the millennium God will hand over all authority to Christ and cause Him to rule. Philippians 2:9 says, "Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name." There are many other Scriptures that speak of God giving authority to Christ to be the King over all things and to rule over all things in the millennium.</P><P>Adam shared all his authority with Eve. Although it was Adam who directly ruled over the world, Eve helped Adam in being the ruler. When the Lord Jesus is King in the millennium, He will exercise His kingship. Yet the Bible repeatedly tells us that Christians are the Lord Jesus' Eve and that they will reign with Him and share in His glory. He will rule over all things, and in the same way, Christians will share in ruling over the world. Although there may be a difference of five or ten cities, our reigning with Him is an immutable fact.</P><P>The birth, death, resurrection, ascension, and life-giving of the Lord Jesus are the crucial elements in His work. If this is all that there is to His work, and if there is no second coming or reigning with Him, a Christian can only have hope in this age and will be poorer than all other men. The saints suffer today in the world. They will enjoy their blessing in the future in heaven! Heaven may be good, but it can never make up for the sufferings experienced by the saints in the world today. Consequently, the Lord Jesus must come back again to this world. In this world He was harassed, despised, persecuted, and crucified. In this world He will receive His glory in the future. It will not be on another planet in the heavens. When Christians suffer with the Lord today, they are suffering in the world. In the future they will also receive glory in the world. This is why the Lord Jesus' coming and His kingship are necessary for Himself and His saints.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
