   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their meeting together is the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not wait too long to bring them to the small group meetings.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Chinese are taught from their youth by their families that they should speak little.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the Chinese never like to open their mouths in public.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is very difficult to get the sisters to speak in the meetings; therefore, we have to encourage them to open up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christians come together, as long as they open their mouths, there is the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It always helps when things are talked out and fellowshipped among each other.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This morning I hurt my shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By then, two other sisters may come in. This sister may tell the other two about it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The two may say, Let us pray!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way, they start praying for the troubled sister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is prayer concerning physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes the prayer can be about spiritual needs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One brother may feel that he just cannot break through in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another brother may say, Have you committed any sin, or have you loved the world?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Is it due to sin or the world in you that your prayer is blocked?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before he finishes his words, a few sisters may pray, Lord, enlighten our brother that he would see within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once our mouth is open, spontaneously, there is the fellowship; and once there is the fellowship, spontaneously, there is the mutual prayer for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Care For and Shepherd One Another</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some may ask in the meeting, What is the meaning of bearing the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among the seven or eight persons present, each may say a little.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother may say, The cross was the tool of execution for the most severe criminals in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another may say, When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we were all crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we should remain in His death, and should not come down from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the meaning of bearing the cross.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Acts 20 Paul said, I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house v. 20 . For I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God v. 27 . Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears v. 31 .</S>
