   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. TWO CASES OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LAYING ON OF HANDS IN ACTS A. The Case in Samaria</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, we should look at the two cases in Samaria and Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of Philip s evangelistic visit to Samaria, a group of people believed and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But they did not receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostles in Jerusalem heard of this and sent Peter and John to Samaria to pray for the Holy Spirit to come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While they prayed, they laid hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, the Holy Spirit came upon and anointed them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Baptism is a declaration that we have forsaken the world, whereas the laying on of hands is a declaration that we have entered the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are two sides of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, we are baptized and have forsaken the world, which is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, we entered into the Body the very moment someone laid his hands upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since we are in the Body, we need to be identified with all the children of God and need to submit to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we put our entire being under the authority of the Head, we will experience the flowing of the anointing within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once our position is right, the anointing will flow to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our position is wrong, the anointing will not flow to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Samaritans believed in the Lord and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But they were in a peculiar predicament the Holy Spirit had not come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostles came and laid their hands on their heads, thus placing them under the authority of the Head, uniting and joining them to the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that very moment a marvelous thing happened: The Holy Spirit descended upon them and the anointing flowed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. The Case in Ephesus</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us now look at the case in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During one of his evangelistic journeys, Paul arrived in Ephesus, where he met twelve disciples who had received only the baptism of John.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul asked them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They replied, On the contrary, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul then asked, Into what then were you baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 19:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul saw the problem; they did not have the proper foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How could a person not have the Holy Spirit if he had already believed in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There was definitely something wrong with their foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Into what were they baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The answer could be easily found.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had received only the baptism of John and had not been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Paul said that they needed to be baptized again, this time into the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then Paul laid hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The laying on of hands follows baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One needs to get into the Body and submit to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the meaning of the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man is not baptized, he cannot receive the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A person must first be baptized, forsake the world, and enter into Christ, having died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then he must see that he should live by the Body and be under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then when he receives the laying on of hands, the Holy Spirit will descend upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The outward manifestation of the Spirit is not the primary focus of what is received.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, I must emphasize the inward flowing of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Psalm 133 shows us that the Head has been anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The anointing of the Head equals the anointing of the Body, which equals the anointing of every member.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank and praise God that when the anointing oil flowed down from the Head, we received it because we are in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we have the anointing, it is a small matter whether or not the Lord gives us outward signs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please note that the outward signs at Pentecost are too external; they are not that crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We believe that the Holy Spirit still comes upon man today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Outward signs are merely one manifestation of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as there is the anointing, it matters little whether or not there are any outward signs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is important is the source of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The anointing comes when the anointing of the Head becomes the anointing of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, prayers that are accompanied by the laying on of hands bear tremendous significance.</S>
