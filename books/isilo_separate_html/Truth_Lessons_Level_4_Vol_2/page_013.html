<h2 class="head2">A. Dwelling at the Shore of the Sea and<br />
Being a Shore for Ships</h2>
<p>After Judah, Jacob spoke of Zebulun. Genesis 49:13 says, &ldquo;Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, / And he will be a shore for ships.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this verse is in Matthew 4:15, which says, &ldquo;Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus began His ministry of preaching the gospel of the kingdom from Galilee. Not only so, after His resurrection He met with the disciples again in Galilee and said to them, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (28:7, 16, 19). Acts 1:11 reveals that the first preachers of the gospel were men of Galilee. In verse 8 the Lord told the Galileans, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; According to allegorical interpretation, Acts 1:8 is the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy. Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, and he will be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. His Flank Being toward Sidon</h2>
<p>Jacob also prophesied that Zebulun&rsquo;s flank, his border, would be toward Sidon (Gen 49:13). Sidon was a heathen city outside the Holy Land. It was located on the sea, and from it the sea traffic went to the uttermost part of the earth. The early preachers all sailed from the Holy Land to Asia Minor and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, Rome, and Spain. The apostle Paul took a ship from the Holy Land and sailed first to Sidon and eventually to Rome (Acts 27:3; 28:14). The history of preaching the gospel to the Gentile world in Acts fulfills the prophecy that Zebulun&rsquo;s &ldquo;flank will be toward Sidon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. CONCERNING ISSACHAR</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being a Strong Donkey Couching<br />
between the Sheepfolds</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:14 says, &ldquo;Issachar is a strong donkey, / Couching between the sheepfolds.&rdquo; In biblical interpretation this verse is linked to the foal and the colt in verse 11. The colt in verse 11 is tied to the rich harvest. Hence, in verse 14 the strong donkey is couching, resting. Issachar is not working. He is couching. He is lying down and resting between the sheepfolds.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Enjoying Rest in the Rich Land and<br />
Becoming a Task-worker to Bring Tribute</h2>
<p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;He saw a resting place that was good / And the land that was pleasant, / And he bowed his shoulder to bear, / And became a task-worker to bring tribute.&rdquo; Issachar, the strong donkey, is resting and enjoying the pleasant, rich land. He also bows his shoulder to bear burdens, and thus he becomes a servant under taskwork. This means that he serves in order to have something to offer to the Lord. Hence, this verse speaks of him being &ldquo;a task-worker to bring tribute.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s people do not labor as hard-working donkeys. Rather, they rest as strong donkeys. While they are resting, they enjoy the riches of Christ. Through the enjoyment of these riches, they become willing to bow their shoulder, take up a burden, and serve for tribute rendered to the King. This will be completely fulfilled in the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s speaking before his death in Genesis 49 can be said to be the deepest prophecy in the Bible. It is also Jacob&rsquo;s blessing of his twelve sons. These prophecies are the conclusion of the book of Genesis and are developed in the remainder of the Old Testament and in the New Testament. Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies are not related only to his twelve sons; they are also closely related to the experience of the New Testament believers.</p>
<p>The first six sons mentioned in Jacob&rsquo;s prophecies are Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar&mdash;the sons born of Leah, Jacob&rsquo;s proper wife. The last six sons mentioned are Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali&mdash;the sons born of Bilhah and Zilpah, Jacob&rsquo;s two female servants&mdash;and also Joseph and Benjamin&mdash;the sons born of Rachel, Jacob&rsquo;s beloved wife. By birth Reuben was the firstborn, but because he was corrupted and defiled, Jacob prophesied that he would not have the preeminence. The preeminence of his birthright was taken away from him. Eventually, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph, the kingship was given to Judah, and the priesthood was given to Levi. Simeon and Levi received no blessing because of their cruelty. Rather, they were cursed and scattered in Israel. However, the scattering of Levi became a blessing to the children of Israel. Judah was to be praised and worshipped by his brothers. He was a young lion conquering the enemies and a lion and lioness resting in conquest. The scepter would not depart from Judah, nor the ruler&rsquo;s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh, the &ldquo;peace-bringer,&rdquo; comes, and to Him would be the obedience of the peoples. Judah would also be rich in wine and milk; his labor would be over, and his rest in rich enjoyment would begin. Zebulun would dwell at the shore of the sea and would be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom. His flank would be toward Sidon, indicating that the gospel would spread to the Gentile world. Issachar was a strong donkey, couching between the sheepfolds. He would enjoy rest in the rich land and become a task-worker to bring tribute. This indicates that God&rsquo;s people will rest while enjoying the riches of Christ.</p>
