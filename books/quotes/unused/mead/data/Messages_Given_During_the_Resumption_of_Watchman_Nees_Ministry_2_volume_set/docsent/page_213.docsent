   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY CONSCIOUSNESS The Body Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Submitting to the Authority of the Head,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Fellowshipping with the Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Outwardly speaking, the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have covered this in the co-workers' meetings in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But what is the content and the life of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a church does not stand on the ground of the local church, it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a local church would submit itself to the authority of the Head, it is spontaneously a church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church, we are members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The meaning of being members one of another is that no one keeps back something for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My heart is joined to all the children of God, and it is related to all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As members, our experience of coming into the consciousness of the Body is just as definite as our individual experience of touching the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body has a Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This consciousness causes a member to submit to the authority of the Head and causes it also to open up itself to the Body and to have fellowship with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what we call Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will use a somewhat inadequate illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a man travels overseas, he may be a foreigner in another land, but he is still under the headship of his own country.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Chinese who loves China and who lives in a foreign land may tell others that he is China; he does not say that he is a Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But then, some foreign students are ashamed to be known as a Chinese; they often say negative things to the foreigners about China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some political fugitives are even worse; they are actively damaging China.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But those who truly love China have a special consciousness about China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They can say that they are China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Taking the Head as the Authority</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and Being One with All the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A person who has the Body consciousness can say that he is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you say that you are the Body, yet you do not submit to the authority of the Head, what you say is false.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, if you are in the Body, you will not just be a drop of water, but you as a drop will be mingled with the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By that time you can say that you are the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Outwardly speaking, the church has the locality as its boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But as far as its content goes, it takes the Head as its authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here all the saints are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The local church is not just a local church as such.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within the local church, there is the testimony of the Body, and in this church everyone holds on to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we fellowship with all the children of God, we will not criticize others easily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The basic issue is that we have to pray to God to create a Body consciousness within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Way to Have the Body Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Dealing with Individualism</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How do we turn from a situation that is without Body consciousness to one that is with a Body consciousness?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, we have to deal with our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For everything, we have to know the positive side as well as the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not enough merely to know the positive side; we need to know the negative side as well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not know both sides, we will not be able to learn the proper lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, the opposite side of sins is forgiveness, and the opposite side of justification is ungodliness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The opposite side of salvation is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man wants to understand forgiveness, he must understand sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a man wants to be justified, he has to be delivered from ungodliness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a man wants to be saved, he must know the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible seldom says that a man is delivered from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most of the time, it says that a man is delivered from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another example is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The opposite of sanctification is to be common.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "holy" is hagios in the original language, and it means to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The opposite of separation is to be common.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the truths in the Bible are in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we mismatch these pairs, we will be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The opposite of the Body is individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, if we want to see the Body, we must first see the negative side of the Body, which is individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A man must first deal with his self before he can see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people deal with the matter of loving the Lord and of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the more they deal with them, the more they build up the self, their own righteousness, their goodness, and their holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This makes it even harder for them to be mingled with others and to follow the footsteps of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Individualism is the deepest thing that is hidden in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A man needs to be touched by God to such an extent that everything with him is dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today man only sees the personal sanctification of the Keswick movement.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why do we not speak of corporate sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The sanctification in Hebrews 12 is a corporate sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today, many people talk about personal faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Why do we not speak of corporate faith?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Bible, when it says "the faith," it means the saving truth, whereas "faith" without the article refers to the act of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"The faith" refers to the corporate faith of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today, man refuses to pay attention to corporate faith and corporate sanctification because he has not seen that what he has is only very little.</S>
