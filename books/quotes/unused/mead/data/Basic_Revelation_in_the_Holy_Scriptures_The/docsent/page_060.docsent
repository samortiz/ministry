   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1; 21:1-3, 10-21 THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>JOHN'S WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Revelation is hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why God in His wisdom uses signs to make it known to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 1:1 says that God gave the revelation of Jesus Christ to Him to show to His slaves; "and He made it known by signs."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Signs are pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In teaching little children we make things known to them by pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes when I speak, I make things known by diagrams.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John received a revelation concerning things so divine, so mysterious, so profound, that no human words could explain it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus the revelation was made known by signs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only the book of Revelation but John's Gospel also is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our Life-study of that Gospel I pointed out that the word miracle is not used.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where the King James Version has "miracle," the proper rendering is "sign."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's changing water into wine was a miracle, but John calls it a sign 2:11 , indicating that it has a meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's changing water into wine signifies His changing death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lazarus's resurrection was a miracle, but John calls it a sign 11:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 1:14 speaks of the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Tabernacled" is a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sign gives us the key to understand how the Lord Jesus lived on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He lived here as God's tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To fully understand the tabernacle, we must go back to Exodus, where several chapters describe the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's tabernacle among His people was not only where He dwelt but also where His serving ones entered to dwell with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While Jesus was on this earth, He was tabernacling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God abode in Him and all God's serving ones, Jesus' lovers, could enter into Him to stay with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This one word as a sign describes what no plain word could express.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also in John the Lord Jesus says, "I am the door" 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you believe that the Lord is a door with a lintel and a post?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A door is a sign, meaning that He is the very opening for people to enter in and for them to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must emphasize the very first verse of Revelation, which says that the divine revelation is given to Jesus Christ and that He makes it known by signs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the key to open up the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without this key, the book of Revelation is closed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To understand the real meaning of this book, we must understand these signs.</S>
