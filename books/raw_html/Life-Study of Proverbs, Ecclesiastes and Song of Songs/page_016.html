<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Love versus Hatred</H2><P>Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgressions (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Restrained Lips versus Many Words</H2><P>When there are many words transgression does not cease, but he who restrains his lips is prudent (v. 19). He who guards his mouth keeps his soul, but he who opens wide his lips will have destruction (13:3). In all labor there is profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty (14:23). He who restrains his words has knowledge (17:27a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Humility versus Pride</H2><P>When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but wisdom is with the humble (11:2). In the mouth of a fool is a rod for his pride, but the lips of the wise will preserve them. A wise man fears and departs from evil, but the fool is arrogant and is confident (14:3, 16). Jehovah will tear down the house of the proud, but He will establish the territory of the widow. The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor (15:25, 33). Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the spoil with the proud (16:18-19). Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, but before honor goes humility (18:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Worthy Woman versus the Foolish Woman</H2><P>A gracious woman lays hold of honor. Like a nose-ring of gold in a pig's snout, so is a beautiful woman who is without discretion (11:16a, 22). A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones (12:4). The wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands (14:1). Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from Jehovah (18:22). House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Jehovah (19:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Mercifulness versus Cruelty</H2><P>The merciful man rewards his own soul, but the cruel troubles his own flesh (11:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Perfection versus Perverseness</H2><P>Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah, but those who are perfect in their way are His delight (v. 20).</P>
