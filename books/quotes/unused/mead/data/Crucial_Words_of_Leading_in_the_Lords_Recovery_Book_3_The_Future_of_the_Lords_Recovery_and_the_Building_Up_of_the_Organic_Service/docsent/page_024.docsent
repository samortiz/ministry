   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S RECOVERY FLOURISHING In America</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I never thought that I would go to America.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1938 a saint from Beijing sent me two checks; one check was for a round-trip ticket to America, and the other was to cover the living expenses for my wife and children in China for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The saint who sent the checks said that she had received the leading from the Lord and wanted me to go to America.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I replied that I did not have the burden to go to America, and I asked her what I should do with the checks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She insisted that I keep the checks because one day the Lord would send me to America.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1958 I was invited to England and Denmark, and I passed through the United States on my way to Europe, but I did not labor in America.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s leading was beyond what I could imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1949, when the Lord brought me to Taiwan, the Lord s recovery was only among the Chinese-speaking saints; there were approximately one hundred churches in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1962 I was led by the Lord to go to America to begin the work there, and in 1963 I began to put out The Stream magazine in English.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I also published books in English.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Due to these few English publications, the Lord s recovery quickly spread to all five continents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, it first spread in America.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now there are more than ninety churches scattered across America.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the East Coast to the West Coast, the situation is very promising even though their numbers are not large.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All kinds of people have been gained, and we can clearly see the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Europe</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s recovery also went to Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Germany is not an English-speaking country, German is related to English; hence, the Lord s recovery was able to go to Germany by means of the English language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not long after the recovery went to Germany, it spread to several other countries, such as England, France, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and even Finland.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a small church in Helsinki, Finland.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s recovery is still spreading in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Last year and this year, we had trainings in Germany with more than eight hundred brothers and sisters meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of them came from Germany, but a few of them came from other nearby countries.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The saints who went from Taiwan thought that they would encourage the saints from Europe, but in the end they were encouraged by the saints from Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This strengthened the European saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Russia</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Europe the truths of the Lord s recovery have been translated into several different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our books have not only been translated into German, French, and Spanish; they have also been translated into Russian.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book The Economy of God has been printed in Russian and sent to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, approximately ten booklets have also been translated into Russian and sent to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord arranged for a Russian-speaking Jewish scholar to be a professor at a university near Seattle, Washington.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has doctorate degrees in both Russian and English, and he is happy to help us translate our spiritual publications.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is also a Russian sister in America who is helping our translator with the spiritual terms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are currently translating The Experience of Life and other books of this category.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A responsible brother from Seattle recently went to Russia to observe the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He discovered that there are many underground churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The believers in these churches told him that they already have the Bible, but what they really needed was spiritual books like the ones he brought them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that we will pray much for this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In England</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The University of Manchester in England has a large body of students and a sizable campus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Recently, their librarian wrote a letter to the Living Stream Ministry in America.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In his letter he said that he had received a few of the books put out by the Living Stream Ministry, which had been sent to him by the saints in the church in Blackpool.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He enjoyed reading the books, and he requested that we send them a set of all our publications in Chinese, English, and any other language.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants to put our publications in the university library.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We immediately sent him copies of all our publications in Chinese, English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Korean, and even Filipino.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the Lord s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Central and South America</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord s recovery has also gone to Central America, South America, and Mexico.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s recovery is flourishing in the mountainous region in Mexico.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our work, including our publications and videos, cannot keep up with the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are on fire with zeal, and churches have been raised up in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are now more than fifty churches in Mexico.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We sent them six or seven video players, and the localities take turns watching the Life-study training tapes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This has been very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Brazil there is an amazing desire for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The brothers there purchased a large piece of property in a town that is a two-hour drive from Sao Paulo.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1981 they finished building a meeting hall that can seat more than one thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Recently, they purchased an old hospital in Sao Paulo, and they converted it into a big meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is where the literature and printing work is done.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The testimony in Brazil began in 1959 when a few brothers from Taiwan and the Philippines migrated there.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, it was not until I went there in 1965 that they began to meet as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There were many Christians, and the brothers were desirous to meet with them as the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But after much consideration we felt that the local believers had a very strong religious, denominational atmosphere and that it was impossible for us to bear the one testimony together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, in 1965 we began to meet as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In those days there were no Brazilian saints meeting with us; all the saints were Chinese, and the meetings were in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I went there again in 1970 and then again fourteen years later in 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I was surprised by the progress that had been made.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>More than eleven hundred brothers and sisters attended the meetings, and more than one thousand of them were local Brazilians.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There were only forty or fifty Chinese saints.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In addition, there were fifty to sixty from Argentina, and there were others from the neighboring countries of Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Most of the Brazilian brothers and sisters have college degrees; several of them were pastors, ministers, or seminarians before they began to meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some of the saints are also doctors and medical students.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The situation there was similar to what I see this time in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Their sharing was completely according to the contents of the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This proves that the Life-study messages had done a great work within them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At present there are at least one hundred and fifty churches from Mexico to Brazil.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Colombia, a cultured Spanish-speaking country, also has churches.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some brothers have begun meeting in the capital of Guatemala.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before they took the ground, they sent us a letter inviting the brothers and sisters in America to attend their first meeting.</S>
