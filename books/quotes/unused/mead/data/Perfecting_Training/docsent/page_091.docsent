   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRYING AND WITNESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then all the time you would cry either, Lord Jesus! or Abba Father!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It would be a kind of spontaneous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then you would witness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever you would open your mouth to say something about the Spirit, the Spirit would witness with you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever you witness, He cooperates with you and confirms your witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GROANING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After experiencing all these six items, we would realize what a poor situation there is among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we would come to the seventh item, groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We would not praise, but groan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a sense, the praising time is not today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are expecting that day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today is the groaning time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We don t know what to say, but we have a certain kind of sensation within us concerning God s interest on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, the kingdom of God!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, God s interest!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s testimony!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You don t know what to say concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So you groan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your groaning then is exactly the indwelling Spirit s interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not by a human word or a clear utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is just a kind of unutterable groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet this unutterable groaning is the excellent interceding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the best intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the best prayer to carry out God s economy on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are such persons experiencing all these seven items, surely the law of the Spirit of life is setting us free.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we practice all these seven items, the law of the Spirit of life truly works in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A SPIRIT OF SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we need to consider Romans 8:15.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a big problem here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now let us read the parallel verse in Galatians 4:6: And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Galatians 4:6 no doubt it is the Spirit who cries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How could the Spirit of God cry to God, Abba, Father ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most of the expositors consider that these two verses are parallel verses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But one of these verses says that we cry Abba, Father, and the other says the Spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit, cries Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who cries?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We or He?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of the matter of mingling, we have to say both.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two verses strongly indicate that when we cry, the Holy Spirit cries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Holy Spirit cries, we have begun to cry already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit of the Son of God cries in our crying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, these two cries are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some Christians don t believe in the matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there is no other way to answer this question but by the matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You can never systematize such a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some say that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet Galatians 4:6 tells us that the Spirit of God, the Third of the Godhead, becomes the Spirit of the Second of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, this Third of the Godhead cries to the First of the Godhead, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This testifies two things: first, that the Spirit of God today is one Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, how could it be that when we cry, He cries?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It also testifies that the Three of the Godhead can never be systematized into three distinct units.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>EXPERIENTIAL REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The problem today with the traditional theology is that they don t care for the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their theological teachings are altogether doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the Bible doesn t care for mere doctrinal teachings; the Bible cares for the experiential revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible reveals to us the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of the good writers, whenever they come to the matter of Christian experience, say the same thing: in Christian experience Christ is identical with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You can never divide these two in your experience.</S>
