You only want to see yourself being uplifted; you do not want to see others being uplifted. You only want to gain something for yourself; you do not want others to gain anything. You rejoice at others' failure and are sad at others' success. This is jealousy, and jealousy occurs not only in the secular realm but also in the spiritual realm. Those who are proud rejoice at their brothers' failures and are unhappy when they see their brothers standing. This is a despicable attitude. No attitude is more despicable. If a man rejoices when others fall, he is the same as Satan, who loves to see others fall. What a shame for God's children to have Satan's sentiment! The meanest and most despicable sentiment is one which rejoices rather than grieves over a brother's fall. The basis for this kind of feeling is the desire for the self to be exalted. One hopes to see everyone around him fall in order that he can be exalted. Brothers and sisters, a person who knows God wants to see both himself and others rise. Those who do not know God want to see themselves rise, yet do not want to see others rise. They even hope to see others fall so that they can be exalted by the contrast. This is a despicable sentiment. Temper often comes because there is jealousy in the heart. If you are a self-exalting person, you will be angry if you see someone better and higher than you. Jealousy leads to anger. If you ignore jealousy and try to deal with just your temper, you will never succeed. You must uproot jealousy from your heart before you can remove your temper. If jealousy remains, your temper will flare up again and again.</p><p>Fourth, with some people the self is expressed in the form of self-love. They love themselves more than anyone else. Their attention is on themselves, and the only persons they treasure dearly are themselves. When it comes to eating, the most important ones to be taken care of are themselves. When it comes to lodging, the first ones to be taken care of are themselves. When it comes to bedding, the first ones to be taken care of are themselves. In everything related to the human life, the first ones in their mind are themselves. They want more benefit for themselves. They want more comfort for themselves. All of their thoughts are centered around themselves. They care for themselves and treasure themselves. When any discomfort comes their way, they become angry. Many people become angry because their self-love is hurt. They love themselves so much that they are not willing to suffer any hurt, pain, or embarrassment. Once their self-love is hurt and they fall into some discomfort, suffering, or embarrassment, they become very angry and lose their temper. Those who have learned this lesson before the Lord know that they live on this earth for the Lord and according to God's grace; they do not live according to their self-love. They live by His grace and not by their self-love. They realize that they live and stand because of His mercy and protection. When they live this way, they do not lose their temper even if they are very justified in doing so. Their self-love has been dealt with. Brothers and sisters, I hope that we realize that all of our temper stems from the self. If the self is not dealt with, temper will remain. We cannot expect anyone to stop their temper if the self is not dealt with. Those who do not deal with themselves will find that their temper is still with them.</p><p>Fifth, some brothers and sisters love themselves so much that they care only for their own things. They are only interested in their own affairs and have no interest in the affairs of others. They have no interest in helping others. Their conduct and thoughts are centered around themselves. They are the most important persons, and their affairs are the most important affairs. Their thoughts are on themselves, and whatever they do is for themselves. They are busy for themselves, and they care for themselves. Therefore, they have no time left for others. If others bother them, they become irritated, and their temper flares up. Their activities are centered around themselves, and they have no sympathy for others. They love themselves so much that they have no time to sympathize with others. They are so busy with themselves that they have no strength to bear others' sorrow. Many people lose their temper when others infringe upon their self-centered love; they feel disgusted and bothered, and they are impatient and angry. The root of all anger is in man's self. If we are not self-centered and are able to sympathize with others and if we learn to love others, we will not feel bothered and angry when others trouble us. We will feel that it is a joy to help others and that by helping others we are serving God. Therefore, we must not deal just with our temper, because it is not the root. We must deal with the root of the sickness. If our self is dealt with, our temper will be gone. The more thoroughly we deal with the self, the more our temper will go away.</p><p>Sixth, some people love not only themselves, but they have other kinds of love&mdash;they love things; they love money. Some people are not yet delivered from material possessions. Money and material possessions are precious to them. All kinds of things are precious to them. They have a self that craves things, objects. The expression of the self in these people is in their love for objects. If someone comes to their house and breaks an object or loses something that belongs to them, they become very angry because they are hurt; the self which is attached to the objects is hurt, and the result is anger. The cause of their anger lies within themselves, not in others. If you hit a piece of wood with your hand, what kind of sound will you hear? You will hear the sound of wood. If you knock on the wall, what kind of sound will you hear? You will hear the sound of the wall. If you knock on a piece of glass, what kind of sound will you hear? You will hear the sound of glass. The hand is the same, and the knocking is the same, but the sounds that are produced are different. One is wood, and the sound is the sound of wood. One is a wall, and the sound is the sound of a wall. One is glass, and the sound is the sound of glass. Different objects have different sounds because the nature of these things is different. An outward phenomenon is an expression of the inward nature of something. Our temper is within; it is not outside of us. If the self is gone, the environment cannot stir up our temper. A man loses his temper because there is the element of self within him. As long as the self is within, he will lose his temper given the right environment. The environment does not produce the temper; it merely brings out the temper that is within.</p><p>In conclusion, anger comes from man's self. As long as a person is angry, it means that a certain aspect of the self has not been dealt with. Perhaps many aspects of the self have not been dealt with, or perhaps one particular aspect of the self remains. Therefore, the extent to which one's temper is dealt with depends on the extent to which the self has been dealt with before the Lord. The more thoroughly a man's self is dealt with, the more he is delivered from his temper. If the self is not clearly dealt with, his temper will remain. We should not be so foolish as to just deal with our temper. We should remember that the problem of self is much deeper than the problem of temper. If we do not deal with the self, our temper will always be present. As we learn to prostrate ourselves before the Lord, we will be enlightened concerning the condition of the self, and God's mercy will bring about many things in our circumstances. If we have learned some lessons before the Lord, we will bow our head when these things come upon us and say, "Lord, Your arrangements are the best. It is good that You deal with my self this way. I submit and I accept these dealings." If you do this, your anger will not be vented. If you do not know the Lord's hand, like a mule that is without understanding, you will think that men or the environment are inflicting these dealings on you. When your eyes are set on men and the environment, you will be rebellious and angry. It is useless for a person to deal with his temper without first dealing with the self. We have to see that the root of temper is in us. Temper in a Christian is a sign of his refusal to accept the arrangement of the Holy Spirit in his environment. We have to learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit and set ourselves aside. We have to realize the futility of the self. If we do these things, the problem of temper will be solved spontaneously.</p><p>Immediately after believing in the Lord, we should deal with the problem of temper. We should not allow this problem to continue; nor should we deal with it only after we have been Christians for many years. A Christian should be one who denies himself. He should not be subjective, proud, jealous, self-loving, or self-caring, and he should not love money. We need to deny the self and realize that everything that comes upon us is under the Spirit's arrangement for our own good. We should learn to accept everything. We should not deal with our temper as a symptom, but we should deal with the root of the sickness. We cannot deal with our temper without dealing with the self. Where there is temper, there is the self. We have a quick temper because we have a quick disposition. However, do not think that those who are slow will not lose their temper. They lose their temper as well, except in a different way. As long as there is the self, there is temper. Brothers and sisters, in order for us not to lose our temper, we have to deal with the self. Once we are enlightened concerning the self, we will be delivered from our temper.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
