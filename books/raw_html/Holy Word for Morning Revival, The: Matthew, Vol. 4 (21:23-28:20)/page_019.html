<p class="bold">WEEK 18 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 25:19-21, 24-25</h2><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.</p> <p class="bold">21 &nbsp;His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.</p><p>24 &nbsp;Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.</p><p>25 &nbsp;And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>A long time [in verse 19] signifies the entire church age, and came signifies the Lord’s descending to the air (1 Thes. 4:16) in His coming (parousia). After burying the talent in the earth, the evil slave thought that all would be well. Little did he know that his master would come to settle accounts with him. Settled accounts signifies the Lord’s judging at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) in the air (within His parousia), where the believers’ living, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15).</p><p>The coming [in verse 20] of the five-talented one refers to the coming to the judgment seat of Christ. The gaining of another five talents is the result of the full use of the gift of the five talents.</p><p>[In verse 21] a few things signifies the Lord’s work in this age, over signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and many things signifies the responsibilities in the coming kingdom. The joy of your master signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This refers to inward satisfaction, not to outward position. To participate in the Lord’s joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom. Here we see two aspects of the reward given to the faithful slave: authority and enjoyment.</p><p>[According to verse 23 the Lord gave the same reward to the two-talented one as He did to the five-talented one.] Although the gift given to the two-talented one was smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord’s appraisal and reward were the same in both cases. This indicates that the Lord’s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work, but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent. The same appraisal and reward would have been given to the one-talented one if he had been as faithful.</p><p>The one-talented one also, who did not gain any profit for the Lord, came [v. 24] to the judgment seat of Christ in the air. This proves that he was not only saved but also raptured to the air. No unsaved person can be raptured and come to the judgment seat of Christ.</p><p>To be afraid [in verse 25] is negative. We should, rather, be positive and aggressive in using the Lord’s gift.…[Furthermore], the one-talented slave went away and hid the talent in the earth. In doing this he was too passive. We should be active in the Lord’s work.…Merely to keep the Lord’s gift and not lose it is not sufficient; we must gain a profit by using it.…What the Lord has given you contains the producing element.…This productiveness, however, depends upon your practice, your exercise of the talent. If you use the talent, it will produce. But if you hide it, it will not produce anything.…The best way to use your talent is to take care of others, to become interested in others and concerned for them. This does not mean that you should become interested in the affairs of others. The Lord has employed you not for this purpose, but to take care of others.
