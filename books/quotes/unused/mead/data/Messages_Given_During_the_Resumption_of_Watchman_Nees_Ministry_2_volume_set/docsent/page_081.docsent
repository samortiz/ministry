   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING NOTHING BUT LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Mak, if others oppose you or criticize you, you do not need to require them to come to you and explain to you what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not be carried away by others' questions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to take the initiative, and you should never be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are thousands of ways to answer a question, but I know only one thing, and that is to turn back to life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Helping others to know life is like a doctor feeling the pulse of a patient; as soon as a person comes to you, you should be able to give a diagnosis and to discern the spiritual condition of that person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can only minister to others what you have.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life is not knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a person comes to us to ask all sorts of questions, we should not give him answers to the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we should give him the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When others come to you, you should not give him many ways to work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should only give him the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not carry him away into work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the case of those who criticize you, you should try to turn them to life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not need to ask the reason for their criticisms, nor do you need to give explanations for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Much less do you need to bring someone else along to vindicate or justify yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You only need to check the spiritual condition of such a one and ask him to pray with you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do this, you will see that you do not have to do anything; the Lord has done everything for you already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a person will say, "Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are truly a messenger from heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not know anything on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You do not know any misunderstanding, any criticisms, or any agreement or disagreement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You only know life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is nothing but life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Galatians 6:15, Paul told the Galatians that it was not a question of circumcision or uncircumcision, but a question of being a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Following that, he said, "As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy" Gal 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we practice this, all the blessings will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BEING MINGLED WITH THE LORD AND</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>WITH THE SAINTS A. The Need to Deal</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>with the Peculiar Characteristics</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to mingle ourselves with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the peculiar characteristics, the unaccommodating attitudes, and the odd dispositions have to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not do this, we will not be able to mingle with other Christians, and we will only be an individual Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some people are like a drop of oil in water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among the brothers and sisters, they are a drop of oil, whereas others are like a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a one cannot mingle himself with the others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a drop of water falls into a glass of water, immediately it becomes one with the water in the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This should be the way with us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. The Need to Deal with Individualism</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cement, water, and stones are the elements that make up concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit is like the water, the Lord is like the cement, and we are like the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for the three things to be mingled together, the stones must first be cleaned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the stones are not clean, even if there is water and cement, the three will not mix together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The stones must first be cleaned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they are clean, they can be mingled together with other stones in the water and the cement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people can serve God, but they cannot serve men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They can love God, but they cannot love the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They can submit to God's authority, but they cannot submit to men's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They can confess their sins before God, but they cannot confess their sins before men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They can fellowship with God alone, but they cannot fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These people are like individual stones; they cannot come together with the other stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For some people, some part of their skin is too old and is not functioning properly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is the need to remove the old skin and to graft in new skin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the new skin is grafted in, what is grafted in must be fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the process of grafting, such a one must endure pain for the old skin to be removed and the new skin to grow together with the other parts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many brothers and sisters are too old.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have to experience some cutting before they can be joined together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you able to withstand such cutting?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is where the crux of the matter lies.</S>
