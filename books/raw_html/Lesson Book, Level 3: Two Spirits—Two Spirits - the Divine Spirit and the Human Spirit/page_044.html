But the Bible also speaks of another spirit&#151;the human spirit, the spirit of man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE SCRIPTURE</H2><P>Even among Christians there is an inadequate understanding and appreciation of the human spirit. Many have never even heard that they have a human spirit! Both the Old Testament and the New Testament, however, have many verses concerning this matter.</P><P>Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all his innermost parts." Job 32:8 tells us "there is a spirit in man." Psalm 31:5 says, "Into thy hand I commend my spirit." We should all know Zechariah 12:1 which says that the Lord "stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundations of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him." We are told to "take heed to your spirit" in Malachi 2:15. There are many other verses in the Old Testament about the spirit of man.</P><P>In the New Testament Paul often spoke of "my spirit" (Rom. 1:9; 1 Cor. 14:14; 16:18; 2 Cor. 2:13), "your spirit" (Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; 1 Thes. 5:23; 2 Tim. 4:22), and "our spirit" (Rom. 8:16). First Corinthians 2:11 speaks of "the spirit of man." It is clear that the spirit mentioned in all these verses does not refer to the divine Spirit but to the human spirit, our spirit.</P>
