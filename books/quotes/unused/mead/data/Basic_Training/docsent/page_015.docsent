   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SONS COMPOSING THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine purpose is also to have a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the books of Ephesians and Romans, the Body of Christ is composed of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, in both Ephesians and Romans we find sonship first and then the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We read in Ephesians 1:5 of the sonship and in Ephesians 1:22 and 23 of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Romans the sonship is mentioned in chapter eight and the Body in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that sonship is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although many Christians today are talking about the Body, they have not seen that the Body depends upon the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not have the life of a son of God, you cannot be a proper member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to have the Body life, we need the full experience of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the experience of Romans 8, it is difficult to have the practice of the Body life revealed in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Between Romans 8 and 12 there are three parenthetical chapters chapters nine, ten, and eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Romans 12 is the continuation of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the practice of the Body is the issue of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we live the life of a son to express God, then we become a proper member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body is constituted of members who are sons of God living by God's life and expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the universe is groaning, eagerly expecting the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The time of this manifestation will be the time of the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life and nature of a son are within us, but this life and this nature are concealed within our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the day is coming when even our physical body will be swallowed up by the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our body will be saturated by the divine life and be a manifestation of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This manifestation of the inner life is the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the revelation, the manifestation, of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE UNIQUE DESIRE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Holiness is for sonship, and sonship is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The unique desire of God is to have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have seen the divine purpose, we shall realize that the Body is God's unique desire and that we must be in it and take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything we do must be out of a concern for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are separate from the Body or alienated from the Body, we become meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's purpose is to have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this, there is the need of sonship, and for sonship there is the need of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, God's eternal purpose is not a matter of foot-washing or head covering; it is to have a Body constituted of sons who share the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HEADING UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God has the Body, He will have the opportunity to head up all things in Christ Eph 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today the universe is a mess, but the time is coming when everything in the universe will be headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is in the process of heading up all things in Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God cannot head us up, how can He head up all things?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church must take the lead to be headed up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, through the church God will head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have seen the vision of the divine purpose, we shall never be distracted, misled, or isolated by anything, no matter how good it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything isolated from the central focus is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I thank the Lord that by this unique vision I have been kept in the center lane for nearly fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I have the burden to pass on this fellowship to you so that you also may be kept by the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As Romans 16:25 says, we need to be established according to the revelation of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have seen, the revelation of the mystery is the divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that God establishes us according to the divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we see this vision, we shall be established, guarded, preserved, and kept in the center lane.</S>
