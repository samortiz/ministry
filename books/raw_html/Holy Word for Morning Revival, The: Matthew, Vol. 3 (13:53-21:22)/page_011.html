<p class="bold">WEEK 12 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 16:13-17</h2><p class="bold">13 &nbsp;Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</p> <p>14 &nbsp;And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</p><p class="bold">15 &nbsp;He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the <sup>1</sup>Christ, the <sup>1</sup>Son of the <sup>2</sup>living God.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In 16:13-20 we come to a section of the Gospel of Matthew concerned with the revelation of Christ and the church. Before we consider the details of this section, we need to consider the connection between it and the foregoing section, verses 1-12.</p><p>Verse 13 says that the Lord Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi with His disciples and there asked them, “Who do men say that the Son of Man is?” It seems that this is not related to the matter of leaven. Caesarea Philippi is in the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border, at the foot of Mount Hermon, on which the Lord was transfigured (17:1-2). It was far from the holy city and the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled every man’s thought, leaving no room for Christ, the new King. The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with its clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which are the pulse of His heavenly kingdom. It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter (16:16-17). It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 18-19).</p><p>The connection between these two portions of the Word…is that if we are still under the influence of religious leaven, we will never be clear about Christ or the church.…If we still hold the concept that there is nothing wrong with Christmas or with the denominations, it is an indication that our understanding is saturated with hidden religious leaven.…Many of us have been leavened from the time we were born.…To you, the church was a bungalow with a high tower and bell.…Therefore, we need to leave the religious center and go far to the north, to the region of Caesarea Philippi, where the sky is clear. Also, we need to say to the Lord inwardly, “Lord Jesus, purify me of every kind of leaven. I don’t want there to be fog without or mist within. I want to be a clear person under a clear sky.” (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 561-564)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>16<sup>1</sup> The Christ refers to the One concerning whom God prophesied in the Old Testament through the prophets and whom His saints through the ages looked for (John 1:41, 45; Luke 2:25-26; 3:15), the One who would come to accomplish the will of God (Heb. 10:5-7). </p><p>The Christ, referring to the anointed One of God, speaks of the Lord’s commission, whereas the Son of the living God, referring to the Second of the Triune God, speaks of His person. His commission is to accomplish God’s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second coming, whereas His person embodies the Father and consummates in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God.</p><p>16<sup>2</sup> The living God is in contrast to dead religion. The Lord is the embodiment of the living God, having nothing to do with dead religion.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 561-566; Hymns: #552</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
