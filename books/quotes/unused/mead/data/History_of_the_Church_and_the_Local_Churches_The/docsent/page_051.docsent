   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Suffering Related to His Marriage</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to relate one more complicated case which caused Brother Nee to suffer greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This case was related to his marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By 1934 at the age of thirty-two, Brother Nee was still not married.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The circumstances surrounding his marriage became a difficult situation for him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was married to Sister Charity Chang, Brother Samuel Chang's sister, on October 19, 1934, the day after a ten-day conference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A short while after Brother Nee's wedding, there was a big turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This turmoil came from two directions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first direction was from Brother Chang's aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Chang and his sisters lost their parents when they were young, and they were under the care of their aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His aunt did not agree with her niece marrying such a "poor preacher."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time in China, a preacher was looked upon as a poor beggar, especially by those of the higher class.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although the aunt would not agree with the marriage, her niece, Charity, was very much for Brother Nee, so they were married.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After their marriage, the aunt continued to oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of those in Christianity found out about this and joined with her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the second direction of the turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day Brother Nee came to me and told me that according to his knowledge there had never been such a problem with someone's wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their names were even in the biggest newspaper in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After he had this time with me, I could not find him for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, I found out that he went far away from Shanghai to another province.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having His Ministry Stopped for Six Years</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>because of Rebellion among the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now I would like to share about the biggest "storm" in the churches in China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to understand why this storm occurred, we need to know the background of the situation in China at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the early days of the Lord's recovery in China, the financial situation among the Chinese was not good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Still, a number of saints were raised up to serve the Lord by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would like to share a personal testimony as an example of the way we lived.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1936 I was sent by the work to northern China to work in Tientsin, close to Peking, the capital.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In those days the work would send people without supplying them with anything for their need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there was the feeling for someone to go somewhere, they went by faith, without help from the work for their material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was our practice in the early days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was in Tientsin, I realized that I needed a bicycle to help me travel in such a large city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I had a little over forty dollars, just enough money to bring my wife and three children from my hometown to join me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I went to the Lord to ask Him how He felt about my purchasing a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was so clear within that the Lord wanted me to have one although I did not have any money to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord gave me the assurance within that He would meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This took place on Saturday.</S>
