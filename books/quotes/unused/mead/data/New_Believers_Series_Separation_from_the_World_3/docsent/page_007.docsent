   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Things Disapproved of by Weak Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Things which stumble a weak conscience are another class of things that constitute the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's children must learn to turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The previous discussion concerns things which the world considers improper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we are talking about things which a young Christian considers improper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a Gentile thinks that we should not do a certain thing, we will lose our testimony if we do it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Similarly, we should avoid anything that a Christian disapproves of, even if the one who disapproves is the youngest and weakest of all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the biblical commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not the words of the strong Christian but the words of the weak Christian that should determine what we should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What they say may not be correct; what they consider forbidden may not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we should not stumble them because their conscience is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may think that we are on the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we take such a way, we will stumble them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul said, "All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable" 1 Cor 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All things are lawful, but others may consider these things to be a form of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we should not do them for their sake.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul spoke of the example of eating meat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said that if eating meat would stumble a brother, he would never eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who can abstain from meat forever?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul's word does not suggest that one should not eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Timothy he clearly said that it is wrong to abstain from meat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, he showed us that he was willing to carry such caution to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It did not matter to him whether or not he ate meat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He might have been clear about what he was doing, but others who followed him may not have known what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may know at which point we should stop, but those who follow may not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What would happen if they take a few steps further?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is nothing wrong if we eat meat, but after awhile those who follow us may go to the temple to eat the sacrifices or perhaps worship the idols as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many things may not be directly related to the world, but we should still exercise care in touching them because others may consider them a form of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>COMING OUT FROM THEIR MIDST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO BE WELCOMED BY THE ALL-SUFFICIENT LORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Corinthians 6:17-18 says, "Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.'"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the New Testament the words Lord Almighty are used for the first time in 2 Corinthians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord Almighty is Elshadai in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>El is God, sha is a mother's breast or milk, and shadai means something that is with milk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Hebrew shadai means "all-sufficient."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The words Almighty God in the Old Testament are also Elshadai, which should be translated as "the All-sufficient God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The mother's milk is all that a child needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The mother's breasts contain the milk; all the supply is in the breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The root of the word shadai is "the mother's breast."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that with God we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second Corinthians 6:17 tells us that if we come out from their midst and do not touch their unclean things, God will welcome us and be a Father to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall be sons and daughters to Him, says the All-sufficient Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can see that these words have not been spoken lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord is saying, "Because of Me you have left many things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have come out from their midst and are separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have terminated your relationships with them and are no longer touching their unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your two hands are empty, and there is nothing left in you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now that you have done all this, I will welcome you."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please remember that everyone who feels welcomed by the Lord is separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people do not feel the excellency of the Lord when they come to Him because they have not counted all things as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who have not counted all things as refuse surely consider earthly things precious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such people do not know what it means for God to welcome them; they do not know what it means for God to be their Father and for them to be God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They do not know that the One who spoke these words is the all-sufficient Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Can you see the special significance of the word shadai?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The words Lord Almighty are used here because when a person has cast away everything, he needs God as the Shadai; he needs a Father who is all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Psalm 27:10 tells us that if our father and mother forsake us, Jehovah will take us up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, He becomes our father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Psalm 73:26 says that when our flesh and our heart fail, God is the rock of our heart and our portion forever.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Herein lies the sweetness of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There must be loss on one side before there can be gain on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The blind man met the Lord only after he was cast out of the synagogue John 9:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we remain in the synagogue, we will never meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when we are cast out, we see the Lord's blessing upon us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As new believers we must come out from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only then will we taste the Lord's sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once we drop something on one side, we will taste the goodness of the Lord on the other side.</S>
