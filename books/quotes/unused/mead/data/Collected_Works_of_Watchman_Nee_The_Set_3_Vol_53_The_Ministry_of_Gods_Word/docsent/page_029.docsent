   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Timothy speaks of the history of Adam and Eve in 2:13-14: "For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan did not deceive Adam directly; his deception was aimed at Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He tempted Eve first, and then Eve tempted Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Eve fell as a result of Satan's deception, and then Adam fell as a result of Eve's temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament we only have the record of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the New Testament, the Holy Spirit opens up this fact to us and shows us that the woman should not be the head in the church; she should not dominate over the man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A pattern is shown, and a basic principle is established.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever the woman assumes headship, sin is brought into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This fact is part of the history of Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet when this fact is opened up, it becomes the basis of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Romans 9 Paul spoke of the story of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He quoted from Genesis 21.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 9:7 says, " In Isaac shall your seed be called.'"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 9 says, " At this time next year I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.'"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is Old Testament history; it is Old Testament fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet the Holy Spirit opened up to Paul the fact of Abraham's begetting of Isaac, and he was able to see its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He began to realize that "not all who are out of Israel are Israel; neither is it that because they are the seed of Abraham, they are all children" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only those who are out of Sarah are the children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's promise was to Sarah when He said, " At this time next year I will come, and Sarah shall have a son'" v. 9 . This was God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Isaac was born of God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only this son was reckoned as Abraham's descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, only those who have believed in the Lord Jesus, who are born of God's promise, are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit unveiled the history of Abraham's begetting of Isaac to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he saw this, he had the ministry of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Paul had read the story of Abraham and Sarah without the interpretation of the Holy Spirit, it would have remained just a story; he would not have had the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, God's Word requires the interpretation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without the interpretation of the Spirit, one cannot use God's past words as the basis of his speaking, and he will not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Galatians, the story of Isaac is expounded with more detail and clarity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 3:29 says, "And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Galatians 4:28 says, "But you, brothers, in the way Isaac was, are children of promise."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was Paul's word; it was his ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where did he derive his ministry from?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He derived it from an Old Testament story.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit opened this story to him and showed him the key to this story, which was the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The key of the promise is found in Genesis 18:10: "I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was a promise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was to happen the following year, not that very day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reason we can say that Isaac was born according to a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Like Isaac, we are also born according to promise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the matter becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul was able to minister God's word to His children because the Holy Spirit had interpreted this word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He had the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, ministry of the word is based on the interpretation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without the interpretation of the Spirit, there is no release of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need the interpretation of the Spirit for prophecy and for history.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every part of the Old Testament history requires the explanation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the interpretation of the Holy Spirit, there is no release of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another clear example can be found in Galatians 3:15, which says, "Brothers, I speak according to man, though it is a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one nullifies it or makes additions to it."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul said that any man who makes a covenant cannot nullify it or make additions to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is true not only with God but even with man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 16 then says, "But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He does not say, And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: And to your seed,' who is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows us how accurate Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Genesis God told Abraham that He would bless others through his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this passage the Spirit of God explained this word to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God would bless others through Abraham and his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What do we know about the word seed in Hebrew?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This word is singular, not plural, in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As soon as this fact dawned on Paul, he became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God's intention was not to bless the nations through the many descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If that were the case, God's grace would have been for the Jews only; only they could bring blessing to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the word seed is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When God said that He was going to bless the nations through the seed of Abraham, He was referring to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The fact is simple, involving one word being singular rather than plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet behind this simple fact lies a very important truth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Holy Spirit opened up this fact to Paul and showed him the meaning behind this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once he became clear, he had the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let us consider another fact.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Abraham believed God, and God reckoned him righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is recorded in Genesis 15.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Based on this Paul showed us that God does not justify man according to his righteousness but according to his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is Paul's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Abraham believed God, and God reckoned this faith as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Paul went on to show us that all of Abraham's descendants are justified the same way that Abraham was justified.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Abraham was justified by faith, and all those who are justified by faith are sons of Abraham Gal 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God justified Abraham out of faith; He reckoned Abraham righteous out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Similarly, He justifies everyone who, like Abraham, possesses the same faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Paul shows that Genesis 15 speaks not only of a fact or of history but of a principle, the principle of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should remember that both Old Testament history and Old Testament prophecies are equally valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some people think that the prophecies, ordinances, and teachings in the Bible are valuable but that the history is not.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They consider the history as merely stories.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But we must remember that all historical records in the Bible are part of God's word, in the same way that the teachings are God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we show an unbeliever God's Word, he may take the book of Proverbs and throw out Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But we know that the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament are God's word, and so are the teachings, the ordinances, and even the history.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God's Word is one undivided whole, and the same principle governs all of its parts.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whether they are presented in the form of history or in the form of prophecy, they are equally God's word, and they equally require the Holy Spirit's interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Prophecies require interpretation by the Holy Spirit, and the history also requires interpretation by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Many truths and revelations come from the unveiling of Old Testament history.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In serving as a minister of God's word, Paul sometimes received the Spirit's revelation through Old Testament prophecies and sometimes through historical records.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Once he saw the revelation, he had the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is the need for the interpretation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Holy Spirit has to interpret the facts in the Old Testament to us before we can have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Otherwise there is no ministry of the word.</S>
