   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The picture that Luke presents to us is different from the picture that Matthew and Mark present.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Luke 5:36 says, "And He also spoke a parable to them: No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise, he will tear the new garment."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose a man has two garments, one old and the other new.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On returning home, he sees that the old garment is torn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Will he cut out a patch of the new garment and mend the old?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does, he is either a mad- man or an idiot.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Can he say that he loves his old garment so much, and has been wearing it for so long, and is so attached to it, he does not want to throw it away?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can he say that since it is torn, he will cut out a patch from the new garment to mend it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Materially, no one would do this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But spiritually, many people are doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The cloth mentioned in Matthew and Mark is the unfulled cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It refers to the time before the Lord's death and to the fact that His work was not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His work was accomplished after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord was dying, He said, "It is finished."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His death completed the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His living was just an unfulled cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Luke shows us not just cloth, but finished cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not unfulled cloth, but fulled cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Trying to put the Lord's finished cloth on an old garment is like someone calling on the Lord Jesus to help him after he has tried his best to do good and cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some Christians I have met have said that they should keep the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I asked if they had kept them, and they said that they had so far.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I asked them what they would do if they could not make it all the way, and they answered that they would ask the Lord for help because the Lord had accumulated so much merit already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I told them that their logic was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I know that I cannot do good, so I ask the Lord to do it for me right from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I know that I cannot make it even if I try hard, and I cannot improve myself or do good even if I try.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can only commit myself fully to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some think that they will ask the Lord for help only if they cannot do a proper job.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Lord Jesus said that no one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If one cannot do good, it is better to throw away the old garment and put on the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I cannot expect the Lord Jesus to mend my old and torn garment, I might as well not mend it and put on a new garment instead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No sound and reasonable person would do such a thing to his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet spiritually, many try to tear a patch from the new garment and put it on the old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where does the cloth mentioned in Luke come from?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It comes from the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we have a new garment, which is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have no other way to save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can only confess our sins; there is no other way to remove our sin or please God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our only way lies in removing the goodness of our flesh and everything that we consider good, that is, in removing our own torn garment, and acknowledging that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior, and that His cross has accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was crucified on the cross, and He has satisfied God's righteous demand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The garment He gives us is new and perfect; nothing more needs to be added.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the cross the Lord Jesus said, "It is finished."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people do not realize that God's redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They think that in order to be saved, they have to do some good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a foolish attempt to tear a patch of new cloth to mend the old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I will illustrate this with a story.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once two persons were discussing religion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mr. A asked Mr. B if he had a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Mr. B said that he did.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mr. A asked further what his religion was.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Mr. B said that his religion was to try his best to do good, and that if he was good enough, he would be saved, but that if he was not good enough, he would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mr. B then asked Mr. A what his religion was.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Mr. A said that his religion was different from Mr. B's. He said that Mr. B had a "doing" religion, while his religion was a "done" religion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Indeed this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people today have the same kind of thought; they think that they have to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the Bible shows us that it is not a matter of doing something or improving something, but a matter of what the Lord has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jesus Christ has borne our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He declared on the cross, "It is finished."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has absolutely and fully accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we do not have to do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All that we have to do now is to acknowledge that our garment is torn, that we are corrupt and cannot perform any good, and that we need the Lord to give us a new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we try to make penance or resolutions to do good, we will end up making more penance and more resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can be saved only through trusting in the accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no other way except this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A carpenter once handed over his possessions to his son who was also a carpenter before his death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He told his son, "I have a wood cabinet in my room that I have finished.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the best and most precious item among my possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I built it with the best wood and coated it with the best coatings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I built it and intended to use it myself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But now I am giving it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The son was also a carpenter, but was not as skillful as his father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In fact, he was a novice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, when he looked at the cabinet, he felt that something was missing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before his father died, he took the cabinet and tried to add one or two drawers and some molding to the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But what he added only diminished the beauty of the cabinet.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His mother went and told the father about this, and he called his son over and said, "The cabinet was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You have only ruined it by your additions."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Indeed, everything is ready, and there is no need to add anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This illustration shows us that the Lord has accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He does not want anyone to add anything or do anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Suppose I invite you to a meal at my house.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You may think that there are not enough bowls in my house and secretly hide a bowl and a set of chopsticks in your handkerchief.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Or you may think that there will not be enough food and bring some bread along.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Doing this would embarrass me as the host.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As hosts, we may be negligent, but as the Host, God will never be negligent.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord says that those who come to Him, He will by no means cast out John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Luke 14:17 also says, "Come, for all things are now ready."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Friends, do you think that salvation is a matter of our bringing a bag of merit or a bag of good works to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some say, "It is true that Jesus saves me, and that by believing in Him I will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But I have to add some merit also, so that I can become more worthy of salvation and eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you do this, you are putting God to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should realize that God has finished the work of redemption; there is no need to add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is useless for us to try to be saved through our own works.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What will happen if you try to add something or cut out something?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise, he will tear the new garment, and also the patch from the new will not match the old" Luke 5:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This means to ruin the accomplished work of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It also means that the new and the old do not match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The words "will not match" in the original language mean "is not harmonious with."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What is the meaning of not being harmonious with something?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Suppose an old green gown is torn.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we mend it with a patch of new green cloth, the contrast in color will be like putting a piece of jade on a gold ring.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In mending clothes, we have to put patches of similar color on the garment.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we put a patch of new cloth on an old garment, the color of the patch will show a sharp contrast at the torn spot and speak loudly that there is a mismatch.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Friends, God's salvation is not only incompatible with our old garment, but it actually exposes our raggedness.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The new and the old are totally incompatible with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you have an old garment that needs to be mended, the best kind of mending is one that no one notices.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What kind of mending is most conspicuous?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is mending with patches that are different in color from the garment.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Although one may be very skillful in needlework, everyone will know that it is a mended garment if he puts white patches against a background of red or blue.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Of course, there is the question of the texture of the fabric also.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>What is a mismatch?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It is making others see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Are you trying to patch your shortcomings with what the Lord Jesus has?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The two do not match.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If you believe in the Lord Jesus, you have to accept a brand-new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If you will only take a little patch, it will make things look worse.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you accept the Lord absolutely, God's righteousness will cover your shame.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>But if you try to take a patch of God's righteousness the new garment and mend it to yourself, it will only make you look worse.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The teachings of Jesus Christ are the unfulled cloth; they cannot save us.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is His finished redemption that saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>However, we cannot take a patch from this redemption to mend our ragged conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We can only totally place before God the best of humanity and human behavior and put on God's new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We can never say, "It is true that Jesus has saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But I am merely patching His redemption onto my torn garment."</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Today God wants us to throw away our torn garment and put on a new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Thank the Lord that I have never seen one person without a torn garment; I have never seen one person who is not a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Even among us today, everyone has a torn garment, and everyone is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Every man is a sinner; there is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Everyone's garment is torn.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But thank the Lord that with Him is the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>There is no reason that a person should refuse this new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The redemption of Jesus Christ is sufficient to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Even if there is a man who is called the greatest sinner on earth, a new garment is waiting for him.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If there is a woman who is called the greatest sinner on earth, a new garment is waiting for her.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>From now on, if a man is not saved, it is not because there is not a new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>If anyone perishes, it will not be because he is incapable of mending clothes, but because he will not put on the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>From now on, man is not saved by his works; he is saved by one thing only: believing and receiving the accomplished work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>In the future, when one goes to heaven and finds Paul, or Peter, they will admit that their garments are torn.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>No one can boast that his mending work is better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>As long as one believes, he will enter into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Sinners, you have heard today that salvation is not a matter of being a good person or a bad person.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Salvation depends on whether you will receive Him or reject Him today.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>All those who receive Jesus Christ will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>If there is a trembling sinner sitting here, he should listen.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The Son of God has passed through death, and the new garment is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>All you have to do is to put it on.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Salvation does not depend on how much your work is worth, but on how much the cross of Calvary is worth.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Your work is worth nothing with respect to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>The only thing that has real value is the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
