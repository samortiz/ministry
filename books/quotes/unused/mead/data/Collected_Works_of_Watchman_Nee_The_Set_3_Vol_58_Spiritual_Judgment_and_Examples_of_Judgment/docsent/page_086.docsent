   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 65 Date:September 27, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. N.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the age of sixteen I heard Paget Wilkes in a conference and came to realize that I was a sinner and needed the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From that time onward I believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once I went with my brother to cast out a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The demon knew that we were Christians and was scared.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It left the man, and our faith was strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was in school, I knelt down to pray three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once when I was praying, I seemed to hear a voice, saying, "Just as I have saved you, you should save others."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I asked the Lord whether I should be a preacher and told Him that I was willing to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since that day I have not heard any voice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In February of 1931 our school invited Brother Nee to come to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He preached on the subject "There Is God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After I heard it, I felt that it was different from other preachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After this, I often went to Wen-teh Lane in Hardoon Road, Shanghai, to meet with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In fact, I did not go to any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time Brother Nee asked me to take shorthand notes of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been doing that since then.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once I was deceived by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee told me that everything Satan says to us is false and should be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was bothered by Satan so much that I became confused in my mind and sick for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could not focus my thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was full of confusion and fear even while I was sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I called on the name of the Lord, saying, "Lord, I am afraid."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Soon the fear left me, and my sickness gradually went away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the Lord's word came to me: "Seek Jehovah while He may be found;/Call upon Him while He is near" Isa 55:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I went to the meetings of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was willing to seek Him and to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There I saw many people handing over their all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was touched to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After that, I came to Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee wanted me to take shorthand notes again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said I could not do it because my head hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Nee said that I should not worry and that the headache was not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said, "My head belongs to me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can you say that it is not my business?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told me just to work anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As I was taking the notes of Brother Nee's message on "The Holy Spirit, the Church, and Resurrection," I began to believe his words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's resurrection power uplifted me and sustained me to continue in my note taking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The messages on the mountain show me how subjective, proud, and self-loving I have been.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I also have discovered a strange phenomenon: My head hurts under certain circumstances and does not hurt under other circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever I set my mind on unrelated subjects, my head hurts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But whenever I reject these distracting things, my head stops hurting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Within my being I discovered that my mind is mixed up with God's will, my feelings, and Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When my mind is under control, my condition improves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since 1935 Brother Nee has been telling me that my mind needs to come under control.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet even today, I have not learned this lesson well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I feel that Satan, the father of liars, is always tempting me to think wild things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can only ask my dear Lord who loves me to control my thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Being Simple in Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our brother is very strong in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before the Lord our mind should be as simple as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your thoughts are wild, active, and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even while you are being dealt with, you cannot stop thinking, and your thoughts run out of your control.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This makes it difficult for you to get through before God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It also prevents you from having a straight pathway.</S>
