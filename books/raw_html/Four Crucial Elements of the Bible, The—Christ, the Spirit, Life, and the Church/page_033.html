<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT—THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:20; 20:22; 14:16, 23, 26; 15:26; Col. 1:27; 2:9; Eph. 2:18; 3:16-19; 4:4-6; 2 Cor. 13:14</h1><h2 class=head1>HYMNS CONCERNING THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>It is not easy to select a proper hymn. The English hymnal that we compiled has 1,080 hymns of which more than two hundred were written by us. The remaining eight hundred or so hymns were collected from among more than ten thousand hymns. We can say that the best of the hymns written throughout the centuries, including certain Pentecostal hymns, are almost entirely included in our hymnal. The table of contents at the beginning of our hymnal shows that our knowledge of the truth is very inclusive.<p>In October 1934, when Brother Watchman Nee was giving the fourth Overcomers’ Conference in Hangchow, he felt that a certain hymn from the Pentecostal movement was very good and suggested that the brothers translate the chorus for singing in the meetings. I picked up that burden. The chorus of that hymn, Hymns, #551, says “Hallelujah! Hallelujah!/I have passed the riven veil,/Here the glories never fail,/Hallelujah! Hallelujah!/I am living in the presence of the King.” Singing a hymn like this was a new thing in the Lord’s recovery because up until then our meetings had been very structured. We had never sung a short chorus like this. It is worth remembering that just after that conference, we had Brother Nee’s wedding meeting, and we sang this short hymn there. My burden in saying this is that you would see that when we put out our hymnal, we had a focus and an emphasis, and we did not cut ourselves off from any truth. Today there is no other collection of hymns like ours that includes all the major truths. When we put out our English hymnal, an elderly American sister, who had spent many years in China, read the table of contents and told us that it was very precious because all aspects of the truth were included there. We did this because we wanted the brothers and sisters to know that our knowledge of the truth is many-sided, but we still have an emphasis and a focus. This is particularly manifest in the more than two hundred hymns written by us, many of which exclusively concern the Spirit with our spirit and the two spirits becoming one spirit. This is a very important point.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING THE BREATH OF THE SON</h2><p>John 14:20 says, “In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” This verse is very difficult to understand. In contrast, verse 6 is not difficult to understand. The Lord says, “I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.” The revelation in verse 20, however, is very deep. Why does it say that it was in that day, that is, in the day of the Lord’s resurrection, that the disciples would know? It is because another Comforter, who was sent by the Father, came on the day of the Lord’s resurrection. In 20:22, the Lord came to His disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, and He breathed into them, saying, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Most Christians understand that the Holy Spirit is the third of the Divine Trinity. In his Gospel, however, John reveals that the Lord Himself indicated that the Holy Spirit, the “another Comforter” sent by the Father, was the breath breathed out of His mouth. This is truly mysterious.<p>In the past, Western missionaries came to China and taught people that the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit were “three persons with one body” and that the persons should not be confused and the body should not be divided. However, the Lord Jesus, the Son, breathed the breath out of His mouth as the Holy Spirit into the disciples. How could the Holy Spirit as the third of the Divine Trinity become the breath which was breathed out of the mouth of the Son as the second of the Divine Trinity? How could the third become a part of the second? This is the mystery of the Divine Trinity. In the books in Christianity today you can hardly find one volume that tells people that John 20:22 reveals that the Holy Spirit is the breath breathed out of the mouth of the Son. No one has dared to say such a thing, but the Lord has raised up His recovery that we may preach the pure revelation according to the Bible.
