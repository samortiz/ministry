<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As Typified by Israel</H2><P>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was also typified by Israel for the carrying out of the kind word of comfort spoken by Jehovah to Israel (Isa. 41:8-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Exposing<br>of the Falsehood and Vanity of the Idols</H2><P>According to 41:21-29, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is for the exposing of the falsehood and vanity of the idols.</P><P>In chapter forty of Isaiah, Christ is the replacement for everyone. Since we have been replaced by Christ, we must realize that we are nothing&#151;a drop from a bucket, specks of dust on the scales (v. 15). God Himself is the only One in the universe who remains forever. Today God is embodied in the Word. As people who are withering grass and fading flowers (vv. 6-8), we need to learn to come to the Word of God so that we may touch God. When we receive the living and abiding word of God, we are regenerated, and we realize that we are part of the new creation. At such a time we can declare, as Paul did, that we have been crucified with Christ, and that it is no longer we who live but Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20). This is what it means to wait on Christ (Isa. 40:31), that is, to stop ourselves, our living, our ambition, and our everything and to receive Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement. Christ then becomes everything to us. In particular, He becomes our strength.</P><P>Isaiah 40:31 reveals that as we wait on Christ, we are renewed and strengthened to such an extent that we mount up with wings like eagles. In the Bible, the wings of the eagle signify God's life power becoming our grace. When we enjoy God in His life power, we mount up with wings like eagles to soar in the heavenlies. This is transformation.</P><P>Anyone who is replaced by Christ and waits on Him to enjoy God's life power in grace is a servant of Jehovah. For this reason, in this book Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah are types of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. They are not servants of Jehovah apart from Christ, but they are servants with Christ and in Christ in a corporate way. In this sense, Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah become Christ.</P><P>Today, as members of Christ, we also are types of Christ. For what purpose are we types of Christ? On the positive side, we are types of Christ for the purpose of carrying out Jehovah's kind word of comfort (41:8-20), which is the gospel as His testimony. On the negative side, we are types of Christ for the purpose of exposing the falsehood and vanity of the idols (41:21-29). This is the New Testament testimony. We testify two things: 1) that Christ is our reality, centrality, and universality and that we are part of Him, and 2) that everything except Christ is false, vain, and an idol. As types of Christ, we testify that we are nothing, that we have been fired and replaced with Christ, and that Christ is everything to us. We also testify to the falsehood and vanity of the idols, the head of which is Satan.</P>
