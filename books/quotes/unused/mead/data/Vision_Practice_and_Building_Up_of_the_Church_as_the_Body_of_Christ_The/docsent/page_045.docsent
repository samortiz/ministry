   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL Transformation Requiring</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That Our Natural Disposition Be Dealt With</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building up of the church is by the transformation of the soul Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have seen, we can be one not in ourselves but only in the conquering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A sister may be very nice, humble, and gentle, but she may still be very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She may have a nice soul with a nice mind, a loving emotion, and a very soft will, but there may be only a small portion of Christ within her.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is difficult for a person with such a nice character and personality to be related in oneness with others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The most individualistic persons are the nicest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easier for even the sloppy ones to be one with others, because they are less individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult for a person who is nice and good in everything to find a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whoever chooses the most proper person as his or her spouse will constantly suffer due to the spouse s individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A husband will never be able to come up to the standard of the most proper wife, and a wife will not be able to come up to the standard of the best gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church I am more afraid of the nice ones than of the sloppy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The nicest ones are the most difficult to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, whether we are sloppy or nice, we all must be conquered by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only do those with bad dispositions need to be conquered by Christ, but those with even the best dispositions must be conquered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, there is no possibility for us to be related with the other members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can never be related to others in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be related in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we all are conquered by Christ, we spontaneously are related.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In actuality, it is not easy for Christ to take over either the nice ones or the sloppy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very difficult to build up the church due to the stronghold of these natural dispositions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The problem is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because everyone condemns sin, it is easy to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, not many condemn their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>More than twenty years ago there was a church in my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time there were two brothers who were poles apart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One was very nice, and the other was sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the nice one came to someone s home, he would first knock on the door.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the owner answered the door, the brother would ask permission to come in, and when he was inside, he would wait to be offered a seat before he sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then after he used a cup, he would return it to the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did everything nicely and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when the other brother came into a home, he would take his own seat, not where the guests sit but at the owner s desk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he would say, I m thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As he drank the tea, he would spill some on the floor, and when he was finished, he would leave the cup carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, these two brothers argued with each other over the matter of disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother felt that the other s disposition was a hindrance to the Lord, and each one justified his own disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This illustrates that everyone acts according to his own disposition with a certain amount of self-justification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In serving the Lord and dealing with many Christians in many places, I discovered that no one is willing to condemn his own disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why it is foolish to try to correct people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One brother may like to go to bed early and rise early, but the brother he lives with may not rise until an hour later.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If these two try to correct one another, they will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, each one will be fully offended and will want to move out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is foolish to try to correct others in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our roommate likes to go to bed late, we should let him do it and not bother him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can never succeed to correct him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can only offend people, and eventually we also will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Transformation Requiring</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That Christ Take Full Possession of Our Soul</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>and Swallow Up Our Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our disposition is very troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only way to deal with it is for Christ to defeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we love Him according to a heavenly vision and we give Him the glory, He will take full possession of us and He will swallow up our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This swallowing up is the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When our soul is transformed and our flesh is conquered, we will have true relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am not passing on a mere doctrine about the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, this is the practical experience for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The building of the church is possible only by the growth of life with the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to be transformed by being conquered by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we are willing to be conquered by Him, the more He will take over us and transform us in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then spontaneously we will have oneness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will have the real building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is what the enemy hates because this is the very thing that puts him to shame.</S>
