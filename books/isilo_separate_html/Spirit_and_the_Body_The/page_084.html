As a result of this prophecy, some people left Los Angeles and moved to other parts of the country. However, nothing happened. The next year the same prophecy was given again, and an article regarding it was printed in a San Francisco paper. Again nothing happened. Although so many prophecies given among the Pentecostal people have not been fulfilled, they still stubbornly insist upon practicing that kind of prophecy. According to the Old Testament, however, a false prophet was to be put to death. But today's Pentecostal and charismatic circles are filled with such false prophecies. Yet, no one seems to care whether the prophecies are true or false.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWING THE COUNTERFEIT</H2><P>As we all know, the charismatic movement has penetrated the Catholic Church. Fearing the loss of members, the pope allows it to go on. Eventually, the charismatic movement became mixed with the mass and even with the worship of Mary.</P><P>Because we in the Lord's recovery are concerned about the practicality of the Body, I must present the real situation to you all. There is much falsehood in the Pentecostal-charismatic movement. The real and the false are mixed together, but the false outweighs the true. The leaven is greater than the flour. This mixture is the most damaging counterfeit to the Lord's recovery today. The Lord's recovery faces both fundamental Christianity and Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. Therefore, we need to pray, to be clear, and to be on the alert. We must know what the counterfeit is.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
