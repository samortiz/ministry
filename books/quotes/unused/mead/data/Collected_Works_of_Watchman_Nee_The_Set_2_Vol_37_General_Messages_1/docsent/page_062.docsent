   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, if you do not have rest or joy, it is because there is something within you that you will not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It may not be certain particular things, but there is always something.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people are very depressed because there are troubles going on within them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers and sisters, is there any trouble going on within you?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is there anything that you dare not ask the Lord about?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is there anything that you dare not think about?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many Christians dare not look into themselves for fear that they will find problems.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians try to run away when God touches them; they dare not sit still and think for a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They struggle and keep themselves occupied; they cannot find rest and do not have any joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers and sisters, if you are truly taking the Lord's yoke and learning from Him, you will be filled with peace and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A brother was once packing up his luggage and leaving his hometown to go to another place to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As he was leaving, he said, "From now on, I leave behind my kinfolk, my family, and my friends."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he said, "I am now the happiest man on earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, perhaps you only know the joy of salvation, but this brother knew the joy of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Indeed, our heart often may be grieving, but our mouth is filled with praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What a pity that the praise of many Christians is blocked by many things!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not necessarily mean that there is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It means that they have too many things apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we allow the Lord to remove these things, our heart will find rest, and we will be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many brothers and sisters have too deep of a relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their relationship with man is deeper than their relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day, when they lose this human love and care, they lose their rest and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, if you encountered unending misunderstanding, reviling, and rejection like the Lord, how would you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some would begin to reason and argue with the Lord, and they would lose their rest and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if they would come before the Lord and say, "Lord, I say yes and amen to all the things that you have allowed to come upon me," they would immediately be filled with heavenly rest and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A brother was walking along a wilderness path one night under the moonlight, and God said to him pointedly, "What would you do if I take away your beloved one?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He answered, "Lord, I cannot accept this."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord said, "You are weak, and you cannot accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if I make you able to accept it, what will you say?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said, "Lord, I thank You and praise You because I cannot make it, but You can make it."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He allowed God to do His work and was willing to submit to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wept and consecrated himself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The strange thing was that once he submitted, he was immediately filled with heavenly joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever tasted the heavenly joy and peace?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord is waiting to give you the heavenly joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The question is whether or not you are willing to take His yoke and learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have not received the Lord's blessing and His blessing still has not flowed to others through you because you are still unhappy with His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said, "My yoke is easy and My burden is light."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, do you believe in this word?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who do not know God will say that God is harsh, that He reaps where He has not sowed and gathers where He has not scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But those who know God will say that His yoke is easy and His burden light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the strange thing is that many of God's children are afraid of hearing about His will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They can sing hallelujah when they hear about God's love, wisdom, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But they are afraid to hear about God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What happened with our Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not call God's will His will; He called it "well-pleasing in Your sight."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To the Lord, all of God's will is well-pleasing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, we have to believe in God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to believe that He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This will put our heart at ease no matter what we encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many times we ask for fish, and it seems that God has given us serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We ask for bread, and it seems that God has given us stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We ask why God has given us a serpent when we asked for fish, and why He has given us a stone when we asked for bread.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But, many times, when we think that we are asking for fish, we are actually asking for a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What God gives us may look like a serpent, but it is actually fish.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many times when we think we are asking for bread we are actually asking for a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What God gives us may look like a stone but it is actually bread.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We often think that God has not answered our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We think that God does not love us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Actually, He is giving us the best thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our God is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The trouble is that many people do not believe in God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to remember that God causes heartbreaking things and difficulties to come upon us because He wants to perfect us and give the best things to us, not because He does not love us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we believe that everything is well-pleasing in God's sight, we will sing with tears in our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not only believe in God's love but also in His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He loves us, and He knows everything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His love never changes, and His wisdom never errs.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nothing will come upon us that is not profitable for us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's power will bring us through everything we need to go through, and this power will enable us to bear the burdens that come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, we can say before the Lord, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Praise Him because His will is never wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Praising God for His grace is initial praise; praising Him for His will is mature praise.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Initial praise is praising Him for what we have; mature praise is praising Him for what we lose.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, we can rest, and we can rejoice because in everything we see God's love, His wisdom, and His power.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the book The Streams in the Desert Oct. 24 , there is this passage: "A piece of iron that is worth five dollars will be worth 10 when it is cast into a horseshoe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If it is made into needles, it will be worth 350.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If it is made into fine blades, it will be worth 32,000, and if it is made into springs inside watches, it will be worth 250,000."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What is the difference between a piece of iron worth 10, 350, 32,000, and 250,000?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is the same material, but after many trials and much beating, it becomes stronger, more pliable, and more valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In order to make us more valuable, God brings us through many trials and beatings.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In order to become a useful and valuable vessel before the Lord, we must not bemoan the things that God has allowed to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead, we should rejoice and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should say to the Lord, "Father, I thank You, because everything You have allowed to come upon me is good."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we submit to the will of God, our heart will find rest, and we will be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our mouth will be full of praise, and our burden will no longer be a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, we have seen that our Lord possessed a deeper joy because He believed that "the justice due to me is with Jehovah, and my recompense with my God."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He believed that "it has been well-pleasing in Your sight."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He told us clearly that we would find rest for our souls if we took His yoke and learned from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Brothers and sisters, if we want to partake of this deeper joy, we should believe in His word, take His yoke, and learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Thank the Lord that His yoke is easy and His burden is light.</S>
