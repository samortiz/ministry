This means that they are the ones sent by the churches, and they are the glory of Christ. It is not just a matter between you and the Lord, nor between you and your local church, but between you and the local churches. If you are sent out, it is not only by your local church but by the churches. All the churches agree in this one thing.</P><P>Then the apostle, in verse 24, advised the church in Corinth to show their love before all the churches. We are to show something for the Lord in the sight of all the churches. It is very practical. We do need a practical church life.</P><P>In 11:8 we see how frank and how absolutely unpolitical the apostle Paul was. He said, "I robbed other churches, taking wages for the ministry to you." I love the apostle Paul for his frankness. In 12:13 we see the same thing. He was so genuine. Brothers and sisters, in the church life we need to be genuine and frank. Do not think that this is a small matter. In the church life you cannot tell a brother to his face that he is good, and then behind his back say that he is not good. If there is no need to say anything, it is better not to say anything. Who are we to criticize? The Lord is the Judge. Whether brothers or sisters are right or wrong, the Lord knows. Leave this matter to the Lord. We must be wise and not say so many things criticizing this and that. But sometimes, as the leading ones, it is necessary to speak, not with the intent of criticizing, but with the burden of bearing responsibility. If I must say something about you, then whether in your presence or behind your back, I must speak according to the truth. We must learn the lesson of being genuine and frank. We must never say anything in two ways with two faces. If we say something, we must not speak loosely or lightly, but frankly in the presence of the Lord. Then we can have the church life.</P><P>If you are dealing with only one local church, it is comparatively easy to be two-faced and go undetected. But if more churches are involved, you will be exposed. How do you behave in Los Angeles, and how do you behave in San Francisco? If you are political, sooner or later you will be exposed. If you cannot be exposed in the first church, you will be exposed in the second. If not in the second, in the third or the fourth. Then your whole fabrication will collapse. The churches are the proving ground to us.</P><P>Finally, in 11:28 the apostle Paul said, "Apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches." How much the apostle Paul cared for the churches! It says here that he cared for all the churches, not for the church. How practical Paul was!</P><P>We all need to know the churches, not just the church. It is more than worthwhile to sell ourselves for the local churches. I am so happy that I have been spoiled for everything else by this. I do not have any taste for anything but the local churches. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may all be so clear and practical.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROGRESSION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery of the experience of the church life, there is a progression. In the last century, the Lord recovered the doctrine of the church through the Brethren. Then in the beginning of this century, the Lord recovered something more, that is, the spiritual principles, the spirituality, of the church. But this was still not so practical. Then after the year 1930, the Lord began to reveal the practicality of the church&#151;not just the doctrine, not just the spirituality, but the practicality. The doctrine is certainly right and necessary. The spirituality is definitely right and necessary. The spirituality is definitely required and is even an improvement upon the doctrine. But in what way can we practice the church life? Must we wait until the New Jerusalem? No. The church life must be practiced today, and there is no other way but the local churches. Without the local churches, we cannot have the practical church life. There must be the churches.</P><P>It is interesting and regrettable to see how Christians in each stage of the Lord's recovery of the church life have criticized and opposed those in the succeeding one. Those without the doctrine of the church criticized those who introduced it. Then those with the doctrine of the church opposed those who saw the spirituality of the church. Eventually, those who see the spirituality of the church criticize the matter of the practicality of the church. This is exactly the situation.</P><P>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may be in the forefront of His recovery.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
