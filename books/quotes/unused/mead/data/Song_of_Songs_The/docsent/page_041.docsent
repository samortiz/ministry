   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 16 says, "Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Her answer is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The north wind is cold, bitter, and biting, whereas the south wind is warm, gentle, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The maiden realizes that the King considers her a garden, and she is aware of the many fruits and graces that she has received from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She does not ask for peace in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the contrary, she is prepared to give forth Christ's fragrance in whatever environment she may be put.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She has reached the stage where she realizes that all problems come from within and not from without.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is a fragrance inside, outward circumstances, whether the north wind or the south wind, will only serve to bring out the smell of the fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She no longer lives according to her environment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She can now live in any kind of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She knows that as long as she is filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit, she can happily live in any environment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She can say as Paul said, "I have learned...how to be abased, and...how to abound" Phil 4:11-12 ; "Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death" Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Her call is an indication of her submission and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The north wind and the south wind are two different environments that the Holy Spirit uses to train believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She has given herself to the training of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the south wind is pleasant and the north wind is fierce, a person who lives in heaven does not feel the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He knows that his circumstances only serve to manifest the grace of the Holy Spirit all circumstances being controlled by the Holy Spirit .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The maiden single-mindedly looks to the Holy Spirit to do the perfecting work in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than what she has expressed to the Holy Spirit, she no longer speaks as much as before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With so many herbs and spices planted already, she now allows the Holy Spirit to blow on them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Since my Lord has planted me as His garden and has given me the grace to produce the fruits, I should allow Him to come into the garden to enjoy the fruits produced."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The maiden first says "my garden" and then "his garden."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My garden is now His garden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything is for Him, and the fruits are for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fruit of the Spirit is not for the believers' adornment or boast.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although it grows within the believers, it is for the Lord's enjoyment and for God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once again, she unconditionally offers the Lord's own work on the earth back to Him.</S>
