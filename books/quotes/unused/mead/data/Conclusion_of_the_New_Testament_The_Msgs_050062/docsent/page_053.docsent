   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>P. LOWLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lowliness is somewhat different from humility.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person may be humble without being willing to be lowly, for he may desire to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A lowly person, on the contrary, is humble in his lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In his lowliness his humility can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Matthew 11:29, Christ has the virtue of lowliness: "I am lowly in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In facing rejection the Lord Jesus was lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself nor expecting to gain something for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, regardless of the situation, He had rest in His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was fully satisfied with His Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should enjoy Him as such a One in His lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Q. SELF-HUMBLING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first part of Philippians 2:8 says of Christ, "Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we see Christ's virtue of self-humbling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First He emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ was God with the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although He was equal with God, He put aside this equality and emptied Himself by taking the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, being found in the appearance of a man, He humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's humbling Himself was a further step in the emptying of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ's self-humbling manifested His self-emptying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The death of the cross was the climax of Christ's humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should worship Him in the climax of His humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>R. OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Philippians 2:8 also speaks of Christ's obedience, saying that He became "obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 5:19 tells us that through this obedience of Christ shall the many be constituted righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This refers to the righteous act of Christ's obedience on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result of this obedience is that the grace of God has abounded to many Rom 5:15 , that the many will be constituted righteous v. 19 , that we have been justified unto life v. 18 , that grace will reign through righteousness unto eternal life v. 21 , and that in Christ all shall be made alive 1 Cor 15:22 . The result of Christ's obedience is life unto all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>S. FAITHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrews 2:17 tells us that Christ is a merciful and faithful High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word "merciful" corresponds to Christ's being a man, and the word "faithful" corresponds to His being God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to be faithful we need not only virtue but also ability.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may have the desire to be faithful in keeping our word, but we may lack the ability, the means, to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, due to our inability, we may be forced to be unfaithful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, as our High Priest Christ is not merely an honest, virtuous man; He is the faithful God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is faithful Heb 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is able to fulfill whatever He says.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, God never lies Heb 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whatever He speaks He is able to fulfill, for He has the means to fulfill His word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Christ can be faithful because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only God can be fully faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>None of us can be altogether faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But nothing can keep God from fulfilling His word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, Christ can be a faithful High Priest because He is the almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since He, as the Son of God, is God Himself, He can be faithful to us as our High Priest.</S>
