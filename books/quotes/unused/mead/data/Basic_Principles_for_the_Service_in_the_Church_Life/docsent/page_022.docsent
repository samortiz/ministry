   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICAL STEPS TO REALIZING THE BODY LIFE Giving Up the Self</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider the practical steps to realizing the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are going to practice and realize the Body life, we first must give up our self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word self is a small word, but it is a practical issue.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to realize the Body life, we must always remember to give up our self, self-seeking, self-centeredness, self-opinion, self-intention, and self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we bring in even a small amount of self, we bring a cancer into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no need for us to do anything more serious; to bring in only a small amount of self is enough for the enemy to damage the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we have said that the first item of the spiritual "charter" of the church is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cross must check our self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do know what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What I am speaking is not a lecture; rather, I am pointing out the practical steps to realizing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we intend to practice the real Body life, we must be one hundred percent careful concerning the self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first thing which damages the Body life so much is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The things of the self are the little foxes which ruin the vineyards when they are in blossom S. S. 2:15 . We may say, "I have not done anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My intention toward the church is good."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This may be true, but a little thing within us the self damages the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not necessary to have a big thing to damage the Body; even a little thing damages it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A small mote can damage the eye, and when the eye is damaged, the whole body cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the same with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Losing Our Independence</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, we must lose our independence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To practice the church life we must learn never to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no independence in the Body life; there is only dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>None of the members of our body can be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Independence simply means death for the Body and death for the members.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should look at this matter not doctrinally but very practically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a vital matter, a matter of life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a hand to declare independence means death for it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may say that you are not independent, that you are a dependent member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, I wish to ask in a practical rather than doctrinal way: To whom are you related?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we ask a finger, it will say it is related to the hand and to the other fingers, and if we ask the hand, it will say it is related to the arm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These members can point out to whom they are related.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, one may be a good brother with everyone's acclaim, but he may not be able to point out to whom he is related.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is good to every brother and sister, but he is independent of everyone and related to no one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is wrong to form a party with someone because we have the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is sectarian, and it causes division upon division.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, in the church we must be related to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves we are not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be related to a few saints without forming a party is a hard lesson to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy to not be related, and it is even easier to be related with others to form a party.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two brothers may often come together, and it may seem that they are of one mind and can easily pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one says, "Hallelujah," the other says, "Amen," and if the other says, "Hallelujah," the first one says, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They may seem to be of one mind, but this may not be the proper relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, it may be a party, a sect, a division with a sectarian spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Still, as members in the church we must be related to someone or ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the brothers and sisters must be related one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we say that we are practicing the church life, we must lose and give up our independence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The independent living must be one hundred percent given up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Try to check yourself as to whom you are related.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you check with me, I would say that I am related with many saints locally and even more universally.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the negative side, if any of them would express even a little that they do not agree with what I am doing, I would stop right away and go along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the positive side, what I do is confirmed and sealed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are one with me in the spirit, and they may say, "Okay, brother, go ahead; we are with you one hundred percent."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here is a real, practical, and serious lesson for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without this, there is no possibility to realize the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we still have our independence, we may be very nice to one another, but we can never realize the Body life among us.</S>
