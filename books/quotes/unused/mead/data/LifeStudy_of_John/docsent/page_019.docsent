   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1 reveals the two sections of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can God, who had no humanity in eternity past, have humanity in eternity future as His dwelling place?</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Between these two sections of eternity is the bridge of time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity past God planned and purposed, but He did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In eternity future God will not do anything, because, at that time, everything will have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In eternity future He will simply enjoy His finished work.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is driving the car of His economy from the first section of eternity, through the bridge of time, into the last section of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By driving His car across the bridge of time, all the necessary work is completed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once God has traveled from eternity past, through the bridge of time, and into eternity future, He will declare, Finished!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In eternity future God will enjoy His finished work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How long is this bridge of time?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may be more or less than six thousand years long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On this bridge of time God accomplishes five things, and we need to consider each of them in turn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We begin with creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Creation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse three says, All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Creation brings things into being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The meaning of creation is to call things not being as being Rom 4:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the most important item in creation?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nothing is more important than man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is a V.I.P., a very important person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Bible, the heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The minerals, the vegetable life, and the animal life are all for man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The air, sunshine, and rain supply the vegetable life; the vegetable life is for the animal life, and both the vegetable life and the animal life are for man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the living things on the earth are for man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man, for whom all these things are, is for God, receiving God and fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a spirit within man which is the very receiver of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By His creation, God produced the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man with a spirit as a receiver to receive God as his life.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man, the center of the universe, has a mouth for eating and for calling.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of how busy a person may be, he will take time to eat every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most people eat several times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not feel ashamed to say that your most important daily activity is eating.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am a good eater.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I eat both material food and spiritual food, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I eat the Lord by calling, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eating the Lord is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the silent Christians are being starved to death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was such a dumb, silent Christian for years, and I nearly died.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I thank You, Lord, that You created me with a spirit and a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians have never thanked the Lord for creating them with a spirit and a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 8:16 shows the importance of our spirit, and Romans 10:9-10 shows the importance of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Justification is related to our heart, and salvation is related to our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although many Christians say that it is sufficient to have a believing heart, Romans 10 makes it clear that we also need a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to believe with our heart and call on the Lord with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more you say, O Lord Jesus, the more you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why are you so weak?</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you call on Him, you will be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many Christians only know how to talk about their weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They do not realize that the reason they are so weak is that they do not use their lips and their tongue to confess the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord Phil 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If every Christian would say, Lord Jesus, continually, Satan would immediately be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
