<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos</H2><P>In the preadamic age, the divine economy in the creation of the universe was followed by the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan Rebelling against God<br>and One Third of the Angels<br>Joining Him in His Rebellion</H2><P>Satan, the archangel, rebelled against God, and one third of the angels joined him in his rebellion (Isa. 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:13-18; Rev. 12:4). Since the number of angels is countless, for one third of the angels to join Satan in his rebellion means that a very large number of them followed him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Universe Becoming a Chaos<br>under God's Judgment</H2><P>After Satan's rebellion God came in to judge. The universe became a chaos under God's judgment: the heavens became dark, and the earth became waste and void (Job 9:5-7; Gen. 1:2a). Because Satan's rebellion polluted not only the earth but also the heavens, both the earth and the heavens were judged by God. The heavens became dark, and the earth became waste and void. That was chaos.</P><P>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Here we see God's economy in His creation of the universe. According to the proper translation, verse 2a goes on to say, "But the earth became waste and void." This indicates that the earth had become formless, chaotic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN THE RESTORED UNIVERSE</H2><P>After the satanic chaos in the preadamic age, God came in to restore the universe. In the restored universe we also see the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><P>Genesis 1:2b speaks not of God's creation but of His restoration of the chaotic universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Restoring the Heavens and the Earth</H2><P>First, God restored the heavens, particularly in its lights, and the earth, specifically in its land (Gen. 1:2b-19). The light was for the producing of life and for the preservation and growth of life. The land was also for the producing of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Creating Man<br>to Express Him and to Represent Him</H2><P>In the restored universe, God then created man to express Him in His image and to represent Him in His dominion (Gen. 1:26-28). God created man in His image so that man could express Him, and He gave man dominion so that man could represent Him.</P>
