   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DOCTRINE OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another very important doctrine in the Bible concerns death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible depicts man as being totally corrupted, without any possibility of being reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only solution is death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man is like a piece of worm-infested wood with no chance of being carved or shaped.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only destiny for him is the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Death is the solution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only dead people will not be proud if you praise them a thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only dead people will not be angry if you rebuke them repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only dead people will not be tempted by sin and will not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Death solves all problems concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But how can we die?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can such a death occur?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A religion will exhort you to die.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Be dead!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are dead, sin will no longer have an object to work on!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But how can one die?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By committing suicide?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By throwing oneself into the sea?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or as the old Chinese scholars have said, by considering everything that is past as dead yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these are methods of common religions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are not the Christian teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WE CAN DIE BECAUSE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The doctrine of death is absolutely related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His person determines His doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What does the Bible say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It says that the world died with Him 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His death was to sin; hence, the whole world is dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Originally, the whole world was in sin, being dead in it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only Jesus was not affected by death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not die of sin; He died to sin Rom 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are one with Him, we are also dead to sin by His death v. 11 . Sin will not have an object to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the problems of sin in us will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the doctrine of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a fact that is absolutely tied to the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not an exhortation for people to conduct a moral life and repent from their wrongs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are not Christian doctrines at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since Christ has died, whoever is in Him is also dead, thoroughly dead, to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin has no more grip on us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If Christ had not died, there would not have been any doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All experiences and doctrines are based upon this person Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE DOCTRINE OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Another fact we have is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, on our side, we are not only dead to sin, disassociated from it; we are regenerated and a new creation in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these are bound to the person Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No accomplishment is by us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>TEACHINGS ARE BOUND TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible is not completely void of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, all the teachings rest on the person Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only when He has a certain experience can there be a certain doctrine or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every single doctrine or teaching is bound to His personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His incarnation is the basis of the union of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His death is the basis of our dying to sin and self and the foundation of a life of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His resurrection is the basis for receiving our new life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything we have obtained is based on what He has attained.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The doctrines are absolutely based upon the person and bound to the person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is genuine Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This makes our faith different from all other religions.</S>
