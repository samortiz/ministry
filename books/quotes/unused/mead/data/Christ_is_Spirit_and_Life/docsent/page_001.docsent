   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He came into the world almost two thousand years ago and lived on earth as a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His life was a perfect human life that exemplifies the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After thirty-three and a half years of sinless human living, He was nailed to the cross to take away the sin of all mankind John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this booklet we will see what happened after He accomplished the wonderful work of redeeming mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible says that Christ went into death for three days, but He did not remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the third day He resurrected spiritually and physically 1 Cor 15:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The abundant witnesses to His resurrection, who saw and talked and walked with Him, are a strong testimony to a historical fact that has remained unshaken for the past two thousand years 1 Cor 15:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Socrates died; Napoleon died; Alexander the Great died; Karl Marx died; and Mohammed, Buddha, and Confucius all died.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Jesus Christ is alive!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His tomb is an empty tomb, and He lives within the spirits of millions of people today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In nature we can see the principle of resurrection every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a grain of wheat is planted into the ground, apparently it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, what dies is only the outer shell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Soon the wheat germ germinates, and the wheat life comes out in a better and more glorious form.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A caterpillar goes through its cocoon stage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently, it dies and ceases from all outward activity; but the life within the creature continues to operate, and in a short time it emerges in full splendor and glory as a butterfly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Similarly, in His resurrection Christ was not only made alive but was also changed to another form.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says that He was changed to a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He was on earth, He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In resurrection He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh was His form before His resurrection, and the Spirit is His form after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul the apostle tells us that the first form, the flesh, was "in dishonor," "in weakness," and "earthy," but that the second form, the life-giving Spirit, is "in glory," "in power," and "heavenly" 1 Cor 15:43, 48 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The best way to understand the Spirit is by way of illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider the air around you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is everywhere and is available to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether you are in the East or in the West, in a closed room or at the marketplace, the air is always with you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible compares the Spirit to air.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, the word for Spirit in Greek is pneuma, which can also be translated "breath" or "wind."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the evening of the Lord's resurrection, He came to His disciples and did something rather strange to them: He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine breath that He breathed into the disciples was just Himself in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
