   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Letters from Sister Bao Hsu-min, Foochow One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Honorable X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I was en route to Wei-Yang from Kutien, I sent you a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I wonder whether you have read it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I arrived in Foochow on the fourteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I worked there for only six days, God blessed the people very much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They had begun their autumn harvest and were very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, their longing made them very enthusiastic, and they attended two to three meetings daily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since the great harvest was approaching, we felt that it would not be good to continue our work, so we stopped the meetings and came here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The situation in the Tai-Jiang gospel hall is very good, and there are many new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I had planned to go elsewhere via Foochow, but some of the believers here wanted me to remain a few more days for the need of the new believers among the women.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I also felt that I should render something to meet their need out of the love and compassion of the Lord, and I considered this as important as the work of personal evangelism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, a few women have gathered every afternoon at the Tai-Jiang meeting hall since the eighteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sister Li Shiu-yi has been in charge of teaching them to read and recite hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I spoke to them on aspects regarding life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the time being, we have decided to conduct this meeting for one week.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Lord opens the way, I am willing to go to the downstream region for a brief stay and then onward to southern Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I also would like to stay at Ping-Yang for a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am now praying about this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to some difficulties that I encountered in seeking the Lord's path, I am afraid that I will have to stay here for a few more days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps I can also visit the rural vicinities around Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The path before me is unclear; I can only proceed one step at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although there seem to be many difficulties, I am very blessed within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I feel very strong and bold, and my heart is firmly secure and at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In spite of the work load, nothing seems to be burdensome and all is well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although I have suffered from a cold recently, my living and work are not frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently, Brother Lo Da-jun, from the meeting at Ching-Liu Township in western Fukien, heard that I had returned to Fukien and tried to invite me to labor in his place for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to go there from Foochow, one has to pass through four counties: Amoy, Changchow, Lung-Yen, and Lienchen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are meetings in the first three places, but in Lienchen there seem to be only denominational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was in Amoy and Changchow last year and also met the brothers who labored at Lienchen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If it is the Lord's will, there should be no difficulty referring to the journey for me to go there, except that I do not know who would go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, I am still praying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I am assured that this journey is all gain and no loss, I will visit Yung-An on my way back where I had been a teacher before , passing through Da-Tien County to Amoy and then to Ping-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have heard that Mr. Nee has returned to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you have a chance, please ask for his opinion concerning my path.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have planned, prayed, and waited, but I need to walk according to God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I wish to be more clear concerning all matters as befitting the proper principles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to present circumstances, some can go with me, but I wish to do so according to God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently I read the newsletters and found out about the situations elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Truly, tribulation is a blessing in disguise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank the Father for gracing the brothers and sisters in other places!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This letter was written during three sittings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some changes have occurred since I began it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first page was written several days ago, while the first half of this page was written yesterday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It has been five days since the meetings in Tai-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord really blessed the meetings according to the need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some sisters still hope to carry on for another week, which may indeed happen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the evenings I have a home-meeting prayer-edifying with some sisters in town.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The house is borrowed; hopefully, we will not encounter any frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please pray for us and give us your comments.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May peace be with you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Bao Hsu-min</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>October 23</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Dear Sister X:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through reading the local newsletter from Shanghai, I learned that you had gone to Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thanks be to the grace of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I heard that there will be a co-workers' meeting in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May God bestow His grace and greatly advance His work through such a meeting, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Though I am here, my heart longs to be there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I had planned to go to western Fukien, but I was repeatedly delayed in going.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Presently, I am still in Foochow sharing the same dwelling place with Miss Li Shiu-yi at the Gospel Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have been resting and having more contact with the academic circle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The activities of my heart, spirit, soul, body, and walk seem quite different from before.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I wonder whether there is any danger in my endeavors.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope very much to be taught by you face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For now, I feel stable and calm in heart, neither burning nor desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I can wait quietly for the Father's fresh grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you are familiar with my condition, please give me some guidance in writing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I would very much appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May peace be with you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your sister,</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Bao Hsu-min</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>November 20</S>
