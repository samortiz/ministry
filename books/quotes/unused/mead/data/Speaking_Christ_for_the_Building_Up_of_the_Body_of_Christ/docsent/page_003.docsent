   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The speaking in our meetings should be with the Spirit Acts 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To speak with the Spirit is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we exercise our spirit the Spirit is present.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not need to wait for the Spirit to descend upon us because the Spirit is in our spirit, in our mouth, and in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Romans 10:8, the Spirit as the word is even in the mouth and the heart of an unbeliever as he hears the gospel being preached.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If an unbeliever is going to receive the Lord, to retain Him, he has to say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once he calls on the Lord, the Lord as the Spirit comes into his spirit and will never leave him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to speak with the Spirit by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also need to speak by our spirit mingled with the Spirit 2 Cor 4:13a and note 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 2 Corinthians 4:13 our mingled spirit by which we speak is a spirit of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both Dean Alford and M. R. Vincent indicate in their writings that the spirit here is not merely the Holy Spirit but our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we speak the word of the Lord by our spirit we surely will have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to speak in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we speak in faith, we will speak with boldness Acts 4:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Boldness is a kind of assurance, and the assurance comes from our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without faith we do not have any assurance and our boldness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have faith, we have the assurance; then we have the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These four items the Spirit, our spirit, faith, and boldness are needed for our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some saints have been in the Lord s recovery for many years, but they have never had any change in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems that they will never change because they have not only made up their mind but also their disposition not to change.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they do speak, there is no mingled spirit, no faith, no assurance, and no boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not these saints would have a change depends on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you ever shouted in a joyful way in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps you want to keep the status of a lady or a gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church, however, we are brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers and sisters should be crazy ones, ones who are excited in the spirit about their Lord whom they love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE WORD SPOKEN IN OUR MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever we speak in the meetings must be with Christ and the church as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our speaking should not be centered on doctrines such as foot-washing or head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to take Christ, the Head, with His Body, the church, as the very center of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regardless what word we speak, the center must be Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first thing, according to my study of the New Testament, that we Christians should speak in our meetings is stated in 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A psalm is long and very cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A psalm cannot be spoken or sung in a wild, coarse, or rough way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A psalm such as Psalm 119, composed of one hundred seventy-six verses, would have to be spoken or sung in a very cultured way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I read 1 Corinthians 14:26 in the past, I only understood that a psalm was for psalming, for singing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the psalm mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:26 is not merely for singing in the meetings but for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Ephesians 5:19, when you are filled in your spirit, you speak in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are poems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalms are the longest, hymns are shorter, and spiritual songs are the shortest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Colossians 3:16 tells us that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are even for teaching and admonishing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These three verses 1 Corinthians 14:26, Ephesians 5:19, and Colossians 3:16 are printed in our New Testament in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may have read them a number of times, but have we ever paid any attention to the speaking of psalms?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In today s Christian meetings, we mostly use the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 14:26, there was no New Testament as we know it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What they had was mostly the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the ancient times, the time of the first apostles, although the Christians did not have the New Testament, they had many new psalms, hymns, and songs written according to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First Timothy 3:16 was probably a quotation of a short song that was very popular in the apostles time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When they met together, they used these psalms, hymns, and songs very much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some teachers would say that psalms also refer to the old psalms in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not disagree with this, but I believe they used more psalms, hymns, and songs written according to the apostles teaching for the purpose of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am very thankful to God that we have a New Testament and a hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our hymnal is very good for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to learn to speak the stanzas of the hymns in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hymn #539, O Lord, Thou art the Spirit, is an excellent hymn for speaking to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I enjoy singing this hymn, but we also must learn to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first two words of this hymn O Lord will stir up the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose a young brother comes into a meeting in which everybody is silent and says, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let s turn to #539.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not call the number first, but say O Lord first.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are apt to do this, when I say O Lord, you will say, Thou art in me as life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Learn to speak a complete sentence, a complete clause, or a complete expression.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother may stand up and say, Brothers and sisters, listen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord to me is as life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then someone else or everyone together could say, And everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then some sisters may say together, Me too!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Speaking the hymns to one another is not the same as reading them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we speak the hymns to one another, we will taste and see the riches of Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes you have to explain a little as you are speaking your way through a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The third line of the first stanza of #539 says, Subjective and available.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A brother may say, The Lord is not only objective but also subjective and available.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then someone else could say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord is available!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone can speak the hymns in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not take the way of the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this system, the so-called laymen do not know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the clergyman who has studied theology and learned to speak is the one who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This system builds up a hierarchy, and we must hate and repudiate it Rev 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must overthrow this system by exercising our spirit to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we practice speaking, we need to be like a team of basketball players.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to learn how to pass the ball and how to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all have to learn the speaking of the hymns in small meetings of six to ten.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we speak the hymns, we should speak them in a proper sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When someone is speaking a verse from a hymn, there should not be other competing voices.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When one speaks, you should either listen to him or join him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You may wait for him to finish his speaking and then continue.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Sometimes while we are speaking, we may make a noise because everyone is praising or speaking at the same time, but this should not be frequent in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Too much noise will kill the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Mostly, people like to hear a clear speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This requires much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Athletes perform seemingly difficult tasks through practice, and we need to be the same as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>With a small number it may be easier to practice speaking the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Keep a good sequence, and keep your spirit living, exercised, and released.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We are so raw to this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But I believe that if we practice day after day, we will pick up something.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Spontaneously we will be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We will adjust ourselves by practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The hymns are especially rich in life experience and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The poetic language is so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In our ordinary speaking none of us can utter the purified words that are in the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is because the hymnal was written with much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Hymn #501 has seven verses.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we read and speak it to one another, we will see the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we speak properly, we can render a message by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We should learn to use complete clauses, phrases, or expressions in our speaking and speak so that others can follow our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We need to learn to speak the hymns in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Sometimes we need to repeat and stress.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In the chorus of hymn #501 there is the phrase, Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We need to read this phrase by stressing it and by repeating it.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We all have to learn to stay away from our natural way, that is, our natural reading and our natural hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We need to learn something new according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Do not speak too loud, too low, too fast, or too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Exercise to speak like an expert.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>A person who takes piano lessons from a teacher and who practices frequently will eventually be able to play the piano properly.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The Word reveals that we need to speak the psalms, the hymns, and the spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Surely this must be very profitable to the Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Otherwise, the Apostle Paul would not have taught us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He taught us to speak the poems, that is, the psalms, the hymns, and the spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In three portions of the Bible 1 Corinthians 14, Ephesians 5, and Colossians 3 he taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In the meetings of the early church, there was such a practice which was lost by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Thank God there is one book in the whole universe that still remains with us and that we can read day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But the tragedy is this when we come to the Word, we always like to pick up the things that fit our natural feeling or our natural thought.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Anything that is new or strange to our understanding we put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Year after year we read the same thing, but we hardly pick up anything.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>For a foreign family to change their native, family language is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>But if they have a heart to change it, they can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Once the language has been founded in their home, the new children do not think the language is hard to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>They will just follow the other family members to speak the new language.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>By listening to the family talk, they spontaneously pick up the language.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Today we are the foreigners, who do not have this language.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>When we try to speak it, we may make many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Now we must learn to speak, not in a formal way but in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We need to be free in our speaking but not wild.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This needs our learning and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I believe that if you practice speaking the hymns in groups of six to ten, you will spontaneously find out how to speak the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>To have one speaker with all the others listening is not the biblical way or the Lord s ordained way for the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The Lord s ordained way is that all the attendants in the meeting speak.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>The saints at the Apostle Paul s time were not born into the habit of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I believe they needed to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We also have to learn, and we must be faithful to endeavor in this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Then we will have something along this line built up in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>When the newly saved ones come to the meeting, it will be very easy for them to learn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>I began to learn the English language about seventy years ago, but my grandchildren all speak better English than I do.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>They have picked it up spontaneously from their English-speaking environment.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We do not have a pattern of everyone speaking in our meetings today.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Our pattern is to come to the meeting to be silent, waiting for somebody to call a hymn, to pray a duty-fulfilling prayer, to give a testimony, or to give an exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>This has become our way, our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Now we have to tear down and discard this way by building up another habit.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Some have said that what I have been speaking the past three years regarding the new way is correct and scriptural, but they said that they did not believe it could be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>If we do not work, of course, how can it be worked out?</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>In 1958, I was staying with a group of Christians in London.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>One day they jested with each other about the endeavor of the United States to put a man on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>None of them thought the Americans could make it to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>About eleven years later, the United States did put someone on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>They did this by endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>I do not think having the proper meeting is as hard as landing on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>When Columbus was sailing toward America, he encountered many adversities, especially from his crew, but he exhorted his crew by saying, Sail on!</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Sail on!</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Eventually, he arrived at America.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>We also need to be those who sail on, who endeavor to enter into the scriptural way of meeting with all speaking in mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>The traditional way of meeting is too old and too natural, so we must drop the old way and mean business to pick up the new way and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>We can make it with patience and with much practice.</S>
