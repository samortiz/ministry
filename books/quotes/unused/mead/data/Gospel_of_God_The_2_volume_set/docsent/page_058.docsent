   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today we declare two great messages to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both of them are what the world desperately needs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is that God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a most wonderful fact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But that is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The other great message is that God in His righteousness has forgiven man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now man can come to God with all boldness and full faith, reminding Him that He has forgiven his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end I would like to ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why is the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that there is something lacking in this parable of the prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the prodigal squandered his estate and came home, the father should indeed love him, but he should have said at least a few words of reprimand to the son, perhaps something like this: "You have taken all your estate and have spent everything; even your stomach is empty now."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the father did not say a word like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No wonder the older son had to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even we have to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is it not unrighteousness when there is sin and it is not dealt with?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If Luke 15 had only the parable of the prodigal, we would have to conclude that God is not righteous, that God has not judged sin, but has glossed over it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the parable of the prodigal son there is not so much as one word of rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But thank and praise the Lord that there are three parables in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first is the parable of the shepherd saving the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second is the parable of the woman seeking the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third is the parable of the father receiving the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Immediately in the first parable we have the good shepherd forsaking his life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus has already come and died.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sin of the prodigal was already judged in the first parable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of what happened in the first parable, there is the second parable, in which a woman lights a lamp to seek for the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the Lord Jesus has accomplished salvation, the Holy Spirit can come to enlighten with His light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this the Father does not see the problem of sin anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The problem of sin has been cleared up in the parable of the shepherd giving his life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In addition, the inward feeling has been enlightened in the parable of the woman lighting the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The wrongs have been realized already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the time the Father comes, all He needs to do is to welcome the prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus has forgiven our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit has enlightened us and has caused us to be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, by the time the Father comes, the matter of sin need not be mentioned anymore; He only has to do the work of welcoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the previous two parables, God's righteousness as well as His love were already manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a person has not yet come to God, but he sees that he is a sinner and realizes that the Lord Jesus has judged his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Good Shepherd has borne his sins away and the Holy Spirit has enlightened him concerning his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When such a one returns home, he has to realize that the matter of sin is forever gone; it has been dealt with on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Remember that the Father's house is not the place to talk about sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not the place to talk about our squandering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The cross is the place to talk about sin; it is the place to talk about our squandering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are at home, God can most righteously choose not to talk about your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can eat and drink to our heart's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can live, wear the costly garments, rest, and make merry to our heart's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has said that once we were lost, but now we have been found, that once we were dead, but now we have come to life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no problem here any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's grace is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, we realize that God's grace is a faithful and righteous grace.</S>
