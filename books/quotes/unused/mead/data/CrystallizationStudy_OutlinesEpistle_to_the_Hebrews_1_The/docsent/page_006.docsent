   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy to sonize us divinely, making us sons of God that we may become the same as God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead , so that we may be God s expression: The seeking sanctification, the initial sanctification, is unto repentance to bring us back to God 1 Pet 1:2; Luke 15:8-10, 17-21.</S>
