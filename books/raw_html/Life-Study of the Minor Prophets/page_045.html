<h2 class="head2">C. The Plague of the Second Sign&mdash;<br />
Fire to Devour the Great Deep and the Land</h2>
<p>The second plague was that of fire to devour the great deep (the deep water) and the land (v. 4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Prophet Praying That the Lord Would Stop It</h2>
<p>The prophet prayed that the Lord would stop it, for Jacob was small and could not stand (v. 5).</p>
 <h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Repenting and Stopping the Plague</h2>
<p>Jehovah repented and stopped the plague (v. 6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Plague of the Third Sign&mdash;<br />
a Plumb Line in the Lord&rsquo;s Hand</h2>
<p>The plague of the third sign was that of a plumb line in the Lord&rsquo;s hand (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Telling Amos<br />
That He Was Now Setting a Plumb Line<br />
in the Midst of His People Israel</h2>
<p>The Lord was holding a plumb line to measure Israel in order to determine what part had to be destroyed and what part had to be retained. Here the Lord was like a surgeon, knowing what should be cut off and what should remain.</p>
<p>The Lord told Amos that He was now setting a plumb line in the midst of His people Israel (v. 8a). He said, &ldquo;The high places of Isaac will be desolated, / And the sanctuaries of Israel will be made waste; / And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword&rdquo; (v. 9). The &ldquo;high places&rdquo; were the places where Israel worshipped the idols on the mountains. The expression &ldquo;sanctuaries of Israel&rdquo; refers not to the sanctuary in the city of Jerusalem but mainly to the sanctuaries in Bethel, in the northern kingdom of Israel. God would make them waste; He would attack the house of Jeroboam (one of the kings of Israel) with a sword.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Lord Not Passing By<br />
the People of Israel Again Anymore</h2>
<p>The Lord said that He would not pass by the people of Israel again anymore (v. 8b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Frustration by Amaziah the Priest of Bethel</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 17 we see the frustration by Amaziah the priest of Bethel, a false priest. In Bethel, in the northern kingdom of Israel, they had built a kind of temple and had their own priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Amaziah&rsquo;s Words of Frustration</h2>
<p>Amaziah spoke to Amos, trying to frustrate him from prophesying (vv. 10-13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Amos&rsquo;s Answer to Amaziah</h2>
<p>Amos answered, &ldquo;Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel&rdquo; (v. 15b), and he prophesied against Amaziah and against Israel (vv. 16-17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Plague of the Fourth Sign&mdash;Summer Fruit</h2>
<p>The plague of the fourth sign, the sign of summer fruit, is covered in chapter eight. The summer fruit signifies that the time is ripe and the end has come upon Israel. The fruit of the fig tree is ripe for someone to pick it.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Not Passing By<br />
the People of Israel Again Anymore</h2>
<p>The Lord will not pass by the people of Israel again anymore (v. 2b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Tragedy among Israel</h2>
<p>Verses 3 through 10 indicate that there will be tragedy among Israel.</p>
