<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO EXPERIENCE<br />THE OVERCOMING LIFE</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 20, 1936, evening<br />Place: Foochow<br />Scripture Reading: Luke 18:18-27; 19:1-10</h1><p>Last night we saw what the overcoming life is. The overcoming life is just Christ; it is Christ living in us. Victory is not receiving some help to become like the Lord Jesus. Victory is the Lord living within man and living for man. Victory is not receiving some kind of power to be humble or to be free from anxiety; it is having the Lord within us becoming our humility and freeing us from anxiety.</p><p>But why have so many Christians not obtained all of God's provisions? Actually, they received the power of Christ's blood, His cross, and His flesh at the time they believed. Yet in their experience they may not have entered into the full realization of these things. This is like a person who has bought two packages of goods and opened only one of them, leaving the other one wrapped up for three or five years. It is a pity that this is what God's salvation is like to many people. Tonight I have borrowed two passages of the Bible. Although these two passages do not deal directly with our subject, I will quote them to show how a person can experience the overcoming life.</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS IMPOSSIBLE WITH MEN<br />BEING POSSIBLE WITH GOD</h2><p>Luke 18:26 asks, "Then who can be saved?" Yet Luke 19:9 says, "Today salvation has come to this house." In chapter eighteen there is a rich young man who was a ruler. He came and asked the Lord what he should do to inherit eternal life. The Lord told him to keep the commandments, to not commit adultery, murder, and theft, to not bear false witness, and to honor his parents. The young man said, "All these things I have kept from my youth" (v. 21). When the Lord heard this, He said, "Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor" (v. 22). When the young ruler heard this, he left in sorrow. Then the Lord said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (vv. 24-25). When the disciples heard this, they asked, "Then who can be saved?" (v. 26). The Lord answered, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God" (v. 27).</p><p>The rich man in chapter nineteen and the rich man in chapter eighteen are quite different. The rich man in chapter nineteen was a tax collector, whereas the rich man in chapter eighteen was a young man who had inherited his wealth from others. Ordinarily an old man like the one in chapter nineteen should have been more stingy, whereas a young man like the one in chapter eighteen should have been more generous, because a young man is not as experienced in the human life as an old man and is not as conscious of the power of money. But Zaccheus did in chapter nineteen what the young man in chapter eighteen could not do. Why is this? Humanly speaking, a young man is relatively generous in the way he spends money and is not as thrifty as an old man. But this young man was different. He could not let go of his money. Actually, not only was the young man unable to let go of his money, even the aged Zaccheus would not have been able to let go of his money if he had been left to himself. But Zaccheus had experienced the Lord's working. Hence, 19:9 says, "Today salvation has come to this house." This means that it was God who made Zaccheus overcome his money. God's salvation came to him. Following this the Lord said, "Because he also is a son of Abraham." The phrase "a son of Abraham" denotes faith. Zaccheus became what he was by faith, not by his own works.</p>
