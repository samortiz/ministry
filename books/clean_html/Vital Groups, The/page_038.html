This is confirmed by John 3:16: God gave us His only begotten Son that we who believe into Him may not perish through His redemption in His humanity (cherishing) but may have eternal life in His divinity (nourishing). God gave His only begotten Son to redeem us in His humanity judicially so that we may have eternal life in His divinity for Him to save us organically.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII.

As the Son of Man to Be the Ladder</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man will be the ladder sustaining and maintaining the life union of all His believers with God (John 1:51)&#151;cherishing. In His humanity Christ is the standing ladder, strong and unshakable. Christ is typified by the ark within the Holy of Holies, which was built with acacia wood overlaid with gold. The wood signifies His humanity and the gold signifies His divinity. According to the revelation of the entire Bible, Christ has two natures. His human nature is the standing part and His divine nature is the overlaying part. This is why Christ in His humanity is the standing ladder. He is strong in humanity to stand in an uplifted way, not a level way, to bring heaven to earth and to join earth to heaven. This is to bring God into man and to bring man into God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.
