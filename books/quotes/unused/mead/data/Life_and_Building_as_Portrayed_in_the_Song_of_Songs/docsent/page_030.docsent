   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING FOR BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For us to be the palanquin and the crown of the Lord is indeed wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we must go on to be the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must grow all the spices which are the attributes of Christ, the sweet aspects of the Lord's person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The calamus, the cinnamon, the aloes, the myrrh and frankincense, the pomegranate and the henna flower are all different aspects of the Lord's person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first part of this book, the Lord Jesus was the henna flower to the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She said, "My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna flowers."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But now she grows henna flowers for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was the henna flower to her, and now she grows the henna flowers to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was her enjoyment, but now what He is has been wrought into her, and she is growing it back to Him for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is really wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And whatever grows out of this garden is the material for the building up of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The growing is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are God's farm to grow the materials for the building up of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why we are both the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must grow all the materials for the building up of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So the entire book is on life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the end, the seeker becomes a city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the last figure used by the Lord to describe His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The city, New Jerusalem, is called the Bride of the Lamb Rev 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH AND THE HILL OF FRANKINCENSE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we need to go back to see a few points about the improvement, the progress, and the growth of the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter two she said, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know that this really happened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She did have a day break, and it seemed that all of her shadows fled away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She attained to such a place that she became the palanquin and crown to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But still, in the following chapters, she said the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense" 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regardless of how much we appreciate her as the palanquin and the crown, she herself still realized the existence of some darkness, for shadows were still there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense the day had broken, but in another sense it had not broken yet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is proof that the palanquin and crown are not the consummation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christian life must go on to obtain the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The building is the ultimate issue of all spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However high our experiences are, as long as we have not reached the building, we are still falling short.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why she still is conscious of some shadows in her life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What then shall she do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She says that she will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The myrrh and the frankincense had transformed her from her natural state into the palanquin and crown of Christ, and she realizes that they will also take her on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This time, however, she needs to enjoy not just a little myrrh, but a mountain of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a small amount of frankincense, but a hill.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is her realization of how much she has experienced the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But she realizes she still needs more; she needs even to abide in the death of Christ and in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The death of Christ must be a mountain to her, and the resurrection of Christ must be a hill to her.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not a small amount, but a mountain and a hill.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She realizes that she must go there to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the way she was wrought into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 3:6, she was perfumed with the myrrh and frankincense, but in 4:6, she is going to a mountain of myrrh and a hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we compare 3:6 with 4:6, we can see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She has come out of the wilderness by being perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, but she still feels that some shadows have not yet fled away.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So she goes to the mountain of myrrh and remains there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She goes to the hill of frankincense and dwells there until the day breaks and all the shadows flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By staying at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, something of God's building is thoroughly wrought into her, and she is fully wrought into God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way she becomes the garden and then the city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is at this stage that the Lord likens her to a garden, and she herself realizes that she is a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She invites the Lord Jesus to come to her as to a garden, and He does.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits" 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse" 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus comes to her as His garden and enjoys all the pleasant fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now she is not only a palanquin for the Lord's move and a crown for the Lord's boasting, but also a garden to grow something for the Lord's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the spices that are grown in the garden are for the Lord's satisfaction and are the materials for building the city.</S>
