The verses in Luke say that we have to forgive a brother who sins against us seven times a day, repents, and turns to us seven times
Suppose the same person does the same thing to you seven times a day, and suppose he says that he has sinned against you seven times a day
It was unthinkable to them that a brother could offend someone seven times in a day and then turn around to repent seven times
Once a child of God arrives at a proper evaluation of his debt to God, he will generously forgive what his brother owes him
In these verses, however, we see a slave who, even if he were to sell all that he had, would not have had enough to repay
As soon as a man hopes a little and opens his mouth to say, 'Lord, be gracious to me,' the Lord pours out His grace to him
When he was a long way off from home and before he met his father, he was prepared to go back home to serve as a servant
From these verses we see again that God does not accomplish His salvation according to a sinner's thought but according to His own thought
The master had forgiven his debt of ten thousand talents, but he would not forgive his fellow slave's debt of a hundred denarii
He also clearly shows us that if a believer does not forgive his brother, he is not dealing with others according to grace
The Lord has forgiven our debts according to mercy, and He expects us to forgive others' debts according to mercy as well
He expects us to do the same thing to others according to a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over
Nothing is uglier than refusing to forgive when one has been forgiven or refusing to be merciful when one has obtained mercy
A person should not receive grace for himself on the one hand and refuse to share grace with others on the other hand
Verse 34 continues, 'His master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed'
Verse 35 says, 'So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts'
Do not tell the brothers and sisters or the elders of the church about it or make it the subject of your conversation
A problem often arises when a brother offends another brother and then the offended brother goes around publicizing it
The Lord did not say that we should deal with it in writing, but rather by going to our brother and speaking to him face-to-face
Just as it is wrong to speak about a matter behind someone's back, it is equally wrong to speak about it in front of many people
In other words, individual sins should be dealt with by the individuals alone; no third party should be involved at all
We should never say anything behind the back of the brother who has offended us, and we should not speak to him in front of many people
While this is, in fact, quite troublesome, you cannot be afraid of trouble if you want to walk according to God's Word
If you feel that your brother's offense against you is too small to be bothered with, you may feel no need to speak to him
If some offenses will indeed stumble your brother, you must point out his fault to him while he and you are alone together
Since it is not a small thing to offend someone, we have the responsibility to tell the one who has offended us for his sake
The purpose of exhortation is not to ask for recompense or to justify our own feelings; it is for the purpose of restoring our brother
Next, the words we speak, the way we speak them, including our attitude, countenance, voice, and tone, must all be right
One must forget about himself completely before he can be humble, meek, free from pride, and willing to help those who are at fault
You should realize that the Lord allows a brother to offend you because He has shown favor to you and has chosen you
If a brother offends you in a small matter and you forgive him, the matter is settled; there is no need to do anything further
If a brother offends you to such an extent that it becomes an issue, you cannot close your eyes and say that there is no problem
The life of the Body is drained through these burdens, and the work of the ministers is wasted through these burdens
If a problem arises between two of God's children and if both of them go to the Lord and deal with it, everything will be solved easily
If dirt gets into a wound, not only does the level of pain increase, but the dirt makes it harder for the wound to heal
The purpose of telling others is not to multiply the gossip but to invite others to exhort, help, and fellowship together
The 'one or two more' here should be experienced persons in the Lord; they should be those who are weighty in their spiritual measure
The mature ones should pray and consider the matter before the Lord and then arbitrate according to their spiritual discernment
If they feel that the fault lies with the offending brother, they should go to that brother and say, 'You are wrong in this matter
Talkative ones can never convince people; instead, invite those who are trustworthy, honest, spiritual, and experienced before the Lord
If the offending brother is one who walks before God, he should lay aside his own view and accept the witness of two or three
Verse 17 continues, 'If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector'
In other words, if he refuses to hear the church, all the brothers and sisters in the church should no longer communicate with him
When a matter is brought up to two or three people and then to the whole church, the Father in heaven will acknowledge such a decision
Even those who are for the law can stand up and speak their mind, even though their opinion is altogether wrong
After the elders have listened to all of them, they should speak their feelings before God and make a final judgment on the matter
