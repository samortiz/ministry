   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I do not know how you feel, but today there is one thing that makes me very happy: God did not cause me to be born during the age of Thyatira, a period of almost 1,400 years.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God also did not cause me to be born in the age of Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are born in this age, the age of Philadelphia, which has existed just over a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord put us in the age of Philadelphia that we may be Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today there are many overcomers in Laodicea, but they are but overcomers in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the entire history of the church, there has not been an opportunity that is better than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore" Rev 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must pay attention to the word "anymore," which means to have gone out at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among the brothers, eight out of ten have gone out before.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's promise here is, I feel, very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a pillar in the temple of God goes out again, the temple will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The following three names are special: "The name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem,...and My new name."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the meaning of a name?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is great meaning in a name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The name of God represents the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Besides Philadelphia, no other church has received the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The name of the city of God is New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, Philadelphia accomplishes the plan of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"My new name."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven, He received a new name, a name that is above all names Phil 2:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here the Lord reveals that of all the churches, He especially fixes His eyes on Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we thank God; we were born in an age in which we can be Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we were born in an age in which the condition of the church is exceedingly confusing, thank God, we can be those of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, please remember that the Lord speaks the same words seven times to the seven churches: "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" Rev 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to pay attention to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's eyes are not only upon these seven churches; His eyes are also upon all the churches in the whole world, past and present, here and abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What the Lord says, He says to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The slackening condition found in the time of Ephesus is quite likely to occur in today's Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the time of Smyrna has passed away, it is quite possible that it may occur again today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is often possible for the condition of every church to occur in one church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those special conditions are but the main conditions within a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible that all the conditions may occur in the seven churches at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two people were walking on the street, and one said, "Just a moment, I hear the sound of crickets."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His friend replied, "You are crazy; the cars in the street are making so much noise, we can hardly hear ourselves talking!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can you still hear the sound of crickets?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But he ran to the wall at the side of the street and told his friend to stand and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sure enough, there was a cricket.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His friend asked him how he could have possibly heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He replied, "Bankers can only hear the sound of money, and musicians can only hear the sound of music.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am an entomologist; my ear can hear the sound of insects."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord tells us that he who has an ear and can hear the Lord's word, let him hear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many who do not have ears and cannot hear the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have an ear, we must hear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Pray that God will grant us to walk in a straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In any situation, no matter what happens, we must choose the way of Philadelphia.</S>
