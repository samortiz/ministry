	 <h2 class="head1">NOT KNOWING PEOPLE<br />
ACCORDING TO APPEARANCE OR THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Who does not have weaknesses? Only our Lord Jesus did not have any weaknesses. When He was living in the flesh, He did not have any weaknesses or wrongdoings, but the flesh He put on was a lowly and weak body. In Him was the treasure&mdash;the glory of God; nevertheless, He was in the flesh. The Jews did not recognize the treasure in Him. They knew Him according to the flesh and said, &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?&rdquo; (Mark 6:3; cf. Matt. 21:11; John 7:41; 6:42). As a result, they did not know the treasure in Him.</p>
<p>In John 8:15-19 and 28 through 29 the Lord Jesus seemed to say, &ldquo;You know people according to their appearance, their flesh. However, you must know that there is a treasure in Me. What I speak to you I do not speak out of Myself, but the treasure in Me does His works. My living and My speaking are not according to Myself. Outwardly, I look like a poor and rejected Nazarene from Galilee, but within Me is the glorious and precious God. I do not do things according to Myself but according to Him. Hence, you should know Me no longer according to My appearance, My flesh, but according to the treasure in Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:16). Before Paul was saved, he was Saul. Saul thought that Jesus was a man from Nazareth, the son of a carpenter, and that He was insignificant. He was determined to persecute those who believed in Jesus, because he knew Christ according to the flesh; he did not know the treasure in Christ. Then one day on the road to Damascus the Lord came to him and said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). Immediately Saul asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; and the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I am the Jesus whom you despise as the humble man in the flesh. I am now in glory in the heavens, and I am speaking to you from heaven.&rdquo; From that day onward, Paul knew the Lord not outwardly according to the flesh but inwardly according to the spirit. For this reason, Paul wrote, &ldquo;So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:16).</p>
<p>In the church we should not know others according to appearance or according to the flesh. Perhaps someone is farsighted, capable, and able to manage things. We would say that such a person is very good. However, this may be the flesh and not Christ. This person is merely an earthen vessel. An earthen vessel may look nice, but it is nevertheless an earthen vessel; it is not Christ.</p>
<p>We must not know or judge others according to their appearance, their flesh, or their outer man. We must know them according to the Christ in them. Perhaps a brother has a coarse earthen vessel that has never been dealt with, ground, or polished. However, Christ, the treasure, is in him. Let us consider the experience of the apostle Paul. After he wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians, some of the believers in Corinth said that Paul&rsquo;s letters were &ldquo;weighty and strong&rdquo; (2 Cor. 10:10). The Corinthians felt that Paul&rsquo;s letter to them was the speaking of God and was rather severe. However, they also said that Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible&rdquo; (v. 10). From this verse most readers of the Bible speculate that Paul must have been small in stature. It must have been difficult for the believers who judged by appearance to believe that Paul, who was small in stature and contemptible in speech, was an apostle, even the top apostle. He did not even look like Saul in the Old Testament who was tall in stature (1 Sam. 9:2). Paul did not have the appearance of someone who was capable, nor was he eloquent. According to man&rsquo;s natural concept, only a capable and eloquent person is qualified to be an apostle.</p>
<p>However, Paul was not such a person. Paul was not good looking; he was weak, had poor eyesight (Gal. 4:15), and his speech was contemptible. To judge him according to his appearance was wrong. Those who judge people according to the flesh are in society, not in the church. In the church we must see the Christ who is in the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO CONSIDER OTHERS<br />
MORE EXCELLENT THAN OURSELVES</h2>
<p>Our enjoyment of the saints is not based on what they are outwardly but on the Christ who is in them, that is, the treasure in the earthen vessels. This is the way that we consider others to be more excellent than ourselves (Phil. 2:3). Otherwise, we cannot consider them to be more excellent than ourselves. If we compare ourselves with others, we are comparing one earthen vessel with another, and we will think that our earthen vessel is better. Everybody considers his earthen vessel to be the best. Even if there is a man whom we all acknowledge to be intelligent, we may not necessarily submit to him. In contrast, whenever we look at ourselves, we always feel that our earthen vessel is precious. The more we look at ourselves, the more we treasure our earthen vessel. It is amazing that we find it difficult to appreciate the strong points of other people, even though these strong points are only part of their earthen vessel.</p>
<p>The Bible, however, says that we should consider others more excellent than ourselves. When we consider others, we should not consider their strong or weak points, we should consider only the portion of Christ in them. If we look at the Christ in the saints, we will realize that their portion is more excellent than ours. One brother has a love for Christ that causes him to give up the world, but we do not have this portion. Another brother&rsquo;s relationship with the Lord has brought him to a point of being broken by God, but we do not have this portion. Still another brother expresses the humility of Christ, but we do not have this portion. A sister has a love for the Lord and a heart for the Lord, which we also do not possess. When we see this, we will treasure the saints from the depths of our being.</p>
<p>When we can look at the saints and appreciate the Christ in them, we will see the treasure in them and consider them more excellent than ourselves. We will be able to love the saints, respect them, treasure them, and enjoy them. This is how they become a source of supply to us, signified by the bread we break at the table meeting. Then not only will the Lord Jesus be our food, but even the brothers and sisters will be our food. We will receive a supply from every brother and sister.</p>
