   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY-SEVEN THE BOARDS OF THE TABERNACLE 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 26:15-25; 36:20-30; 40:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the sequence of the divine revelation, the covering of the tabernacle is mentioned before the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is opposite to the human way of speaking about a building, which is to begin with the bottom and proceed upwards toward the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine way of revealing the tabernacle is to begin with the top, with the four layers of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, according to Exodus 36, the roof of the tabernacle was also made before the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we apply this to Christian experience, we should consider whether in our Christian life we begin from the bottom of the tabernacle or from the top.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The roof, or covering, of God s habitation in the wilderness was of four layers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first layer was fine linen, the second of goats hair, the third of rams skins dyed red, and the fourth of porpoise skins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In typology these layers do not refer to the believers, but only to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first layer typifies Christ as a perfect and complete human being; the second layer typifies Him as the One who was made sin for us and who died on the cross for our sins; the third layer typifies Him as the One who accomplished redemption to meet both God s need and ours; and the fourth layer typifies Him as the One who is strong toward the enemy and who is able to resist all his attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No aspect of these four layers signifies the believers in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the believers do not have any part in the layers of the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This covering is absolutely and thoroughly Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. TYPIFYING THE BELIEVERS BUILT TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TO BE THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Under the covering of the tabernacle there were the walls composed of standing boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These boards typify the believers built together to be the dwelling place of God Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we have the assurance to say that the tabernacle typifies not only the individual Christ, but also the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers, typified by the boards overlaid with gold, are covered with Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the believers are not included in the four layers of the covering, Christ is involved with the boards which form the walls of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know this by the fact that the boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, the same materials used to make the ark, which is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before we were saved, we were not the boards in God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We did not have acacia wood, and we were not overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the natural life, we are not boards.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But according to the divine life in resurrection, we are the standing boards of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we have become acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as the ark was made of two elements, acacia wood and gold, so are the boards constructed of the same two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the boards are the enlargement and extension of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are the same as the ark in substance, with the two natures of wood and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This portrays the fact that we the believers, who are the components of the wall of the tabernacle, are the enlargement of Christ, His extension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you realize that you are part of the extension of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As members of the Body, we are His reproduction, continuation, increase, duplication, and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are also His enlargement and extension.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as a person s body is the extension and enlargement of his head, so we, the Body of Christ, are the enlargement, continuation, extension, and spread of Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, all the boards in the tabernacle are the extension and enlargement of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The dimensions of the ark were two and a half cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width and height.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The dimensions of the tabernacle were thirty cubits in length and ten cubits in both width and height.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we compare the tabernacle and the ark, we see that the tabernacle is truly the enlargement and extension of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same principle, we, the believers, are the enlargement and extension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived and traveled in a very restricted area.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But today the corporate Christ covers the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE ARK</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The tabernacle includes not only the individual Christ, but also Christ and the believers in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, the boards typify the believers; on the other hand, the boards are also related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reason for this is that Christ has made us part of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are no longer in Adam; we are in Christ and have even become part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The corporate Christ is under the covering of the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not have any part in the ark or in the four layers of the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, although we are not the enlargement of the covering, we are the enlargement of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The covering is mainly for redemption, but the ark is mainly for testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have any part in Christ s redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It would be blasphemy to say that we share in Christ s work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we can say that we have a part, a share, in Christ s testimony, for we are joined to the witnessing Christ and have become His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At this point let us return to the question we raised at the beginning of the message: In our Christian experience do we begin with the top of the tabernacle or with the bottom?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tabernacle typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Does the church come into existence from the top down, or from the bottom up?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible does not reveal a church that comes into being from the bottom up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the contrary, according to the Bible, the church comes into existence from the top downward.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is indicated by the fact that the record in Exodus begins with the roof of the tabernacle, not with the boards.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, the fact that the covering comes before the boards indicates that the redemption of Christ must come first.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This reveals that our Christian experience begins with the top, with the roof, not with the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If Christ had not become a man to die on the cross for our sins in order to accomplish redemption, fulfill God s requirements, and withstand the attacks of the enemy, there would be no way for us to be God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The gospel is actually Christ typified by the four-layered covering of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we preach the gospel, we preach this four-layered Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we heard the gospel and believed into Christ, our Christian life began from above, with the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our natural life, on the contrary, began from the bottom, in fact, from the very lowest level.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the reason the layers of the roof are revealed first.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before we were regenerated, the roof, the four-layered Christ, was already in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, our Christian experience begins not from the bottom, but with the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we believed in the Lord and received Him, we immediately found ourselves under the roof, under the covering.</S>
