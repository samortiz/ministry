 <h2 class="head3">A Hymn of Prayer</h2>
<p>To exercise ourselves unto godliness is to let this godly life express itself and become a godly living, until one day we shall be completely like God. There is a hymn of prayer which properly expresses this pursuit. We print it here as our prayer.</p>
<p class="hbody">O to be like thee! blessed Redeemer;<br />
This is my constant longing and prayer;<br />
Gladly I&rsquo;ll forfeit all of earth&rsquo;s treasures,<br />
Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.</p>
<p class="hbody">O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!<br />
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;<br />
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;<br />
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.</p>
<p class="hbody">O to be like Thee! full of compassion,<br />
Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,<br />
Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,<br />
Seeking the wand&rsquo;ring sinners to find.</p>
<p class="hbody">O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,<br />
Holy and harmless, patient and brave;<br />
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,<br />
Willing to suffer, others to save.</p>
<p class="hbody">O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,<br />
Now to receive th&rsquo; anointing divine;<br />
All that I am and have I am bringing;<br />
Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.</p>
<p class="hbody">O to be like Thee! While I am pleading<br />
Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.<br />
Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,<br />
Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.</p>
