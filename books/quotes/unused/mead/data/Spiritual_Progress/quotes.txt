[1]  Every Christian should have spiritual progress, but what is spiritual progress?
[2]  According to the record of the Bible and the experience of the saints, spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God in us.
[3]  God is Spirit, and if the Spirit of God dwells in us, we are in the spirit Rom 8:9 .
[4]  If the element of God in us becomes two or three hundred units, it means that we have made some spiritual progress.
[5]  As long as we are occupied by something other than God, and as long as we do not yield the proper place to God, we are fallen.
