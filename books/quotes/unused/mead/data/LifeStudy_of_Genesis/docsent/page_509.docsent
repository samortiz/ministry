   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Pouring Oil upon the Pillar</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 35:14 also tells us that Jacob poured oil upon the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He did this after he had poured the drink offering upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I used to think that Jacob was mistaken in doing this and that he should have poured the oil first.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Jacob was not mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to our experience, it is the pouring out of the drink offering that brings in the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are ready to be poured out as a drink offering, we are also ready to experience the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we are prepared to be poured out as a drink offering, the more of the oil we shall enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the pillar was set up, it was sanctified by being anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same was true of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After it was erected, it was sanctified by the holy anointing oil Exo 40:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The pillar was set up, the drink offering was poured upon it, and then the pillar was sanctified by the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The oil poured upon the pillar sealed it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This simply means that the pillar was sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The pouring out of the oil caused the building of God to be absolutely holy, sanctified, and separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a good number of us will be ready to be poured out as a drink offering upon God's building, the Holy Spirit will immediately be present to sanctify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter how much we experience the Holy Spirit, if we are not ready to be poured out as a drink offering, we do not have a layer of sanctifying oil upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if many are ready to be poured out as a drink offering, the church will be anointed with oil, and the church life, being sealed with a layer of oil, will be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The real experience of the Spirit is in relation to the pouring out of the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider the experience of the one hundred and twenty on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we all know, on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out Acts 2:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before this took place, the one hundred and twenty were ready to be poured out as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Peter stood up with the eleven, he was already being poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The result was that the oil, the Holy Spirit, came down upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The oil did not come before they were ready to be poured out as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may remark that Peter was not martyred at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This, of course, is true.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But you must realize that he stood there like a martyr and risked his neck.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the Jewish religionists were opposing him, he was not afraid of them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the eyes of the angels, all the hundred and twenty were already being poured out as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the oil was poured out to sanctify and to seal them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On that day the church at Jerusalem was anointed with a layer of heavenly oil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unlike today's Christian organizations, the church was holy, separated, and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May all the churches in the Lord's recovery be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that a good number of saints will be already poured out as a drink offering so that the Holy Spirit as the heavenly oil will come upon the church to seal it, sanctify it, and make it absolutely separated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the experience at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>4 Realizing Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After Jacob did all these things at Bethel, he called the name of the place Bethel 35:15 , indicating that he realized that this was the house of God where God spoke to him 28:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, the church is the house of God 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Like Jacob at Bethel, we also must have the practical experiences for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must build an altar of consecration, we must set up a pillar for God's building, and we must be ready to be poured out as a drink offering upon God's building that the divine oil may be poured upon it to sanctify it for God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To do this is to realize the practical church life.</S>
