   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>11 By Living a Life of the Highest Virtues of the Divine Life and Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, the believers live in the Body of Christ by living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love Rom 12:9-10, 12-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Body life we first should have love toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 9 Paul says, "Let love be without hypocrisy," and in verse 10 he continues, "Love one another warmly in brotherly love."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need the Holy Spirit to work in us and to give us an amount of transformation in love that we may practice love toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Love is not merely an outward behavior; love is the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Trying to love without the supply of life does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to love others, we need the life supply and the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our natural life is not a life of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be transformed in life that we may have God's nature of love to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 10 Paul speaks of "vying with one another in showing honor," and in verse 13, of "communicating to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the matter of showing honor we must move quickly and be the first to show honor to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, we need to communicate to the needs of the saints and to pursue hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 15 Paul says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to rejoice and weep with others, we need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that in the Body life we need to be emotional in a proper way, able both to rejoice and to weep with others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 16 Paul admonishes us saying, "Be of the same mind toward one another, not minding high things, but being led away to the lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not be wise in yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be so high but be led away to lowly things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should seek to be led away to whatever is lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition to the virtues that we need to have toward others, Paul also mentions virtues that we should have toward ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 12 says, "Rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, persevering in prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As believers, we should be a rejoicing people because we have the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we enjoy the Lord in His riches, we shall not only be joyful inwardly, but we shall be rejoicing outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in times of trouble we shall be able to rejoice in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should also be able to endure tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By rejoicing in hope we are able to endure tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in order to endure tribulation, we also need to be persevering in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praying persistently will enable us not only to endure tribulation but also to remain in the enjoyment of the Lord, in His presence and in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, as God's holy people we need to "abhor what is evil" v. 9 , "conquer the evil with the good" v. 21 , and "cleave to what is good" v. 9 . We Christians, who are separated unto God, must maintain the highest standard of behavior, a standard above that of moral and ethical people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul also indicates that we need to live a life of the highest virtues of the divine life and love even in relation to our persecutors and enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He says, "Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse" v. 14 . No matter how others may treat us, our mouths should express only blessing, not cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How the Lord blessed us when we were His enemies!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we should bless our enemies and persecutors in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 17a Paul says, "Repaying no one evil for evil."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under the law it was eye for eye and tooth for tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we are not under law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, instead of paying evil for evil, we should repay good for evil, as the Lord has done to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 19 Paul goes on to say, "Not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to the wrath of God, for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we are practicing the Body life, living a life of the highest virtues of the divine life in love, we should not avenge ourselves in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, we should be willing to suffer people's wrongdoing and the loss of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should leave the entire situation in the sovereign hand of the Lord and give Him the place to do whatever He likes according to His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 20 Paul continues by saying, "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is actually loving our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our love to them will be coals of fire heaped upon their heads to turn them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 12:18 says, "If possible, as far as it depends on you, living in peace with all men."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to live in peace with others, as far as it depends on us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men because the other parties are not willing to have a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In such a situation there is nothing we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, Paul says that we should live in peace with all men "if possible."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 12:17b Paul gives us a general word: "Taking forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should be very thoughtful before all men about honorable things, and we should be thoughtful beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to keep from offending others we should not oppose anything that is honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because we are living not only before God but also before men, we need to take forethought for things honorable in the sight of men.</S>
